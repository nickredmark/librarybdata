<p begin="00:00:01.480" end="00:00:12.139" style="s2">okay yeah it&#39;s I think the gradual</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.750" end="00:00:14.000" style="s2">moving into and realization of these</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.139" end="00:00:16.190" style="s2">different modes of dialogue is something</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.000" end="00:00:19.519" style="s2">that&#39;s very very interesting and I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.190" end="00:00:23.419" style="s2">something that is fascinating you at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.519" end="00:00:25.820" style="s2">moment and I see it at tying in deeply</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.419" end="00:00:27.710" style="s2">to the series awakening from the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.820" end="00:00:32.119" style="s2">crisis and particularly of course the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.710" end="00:00:34.820" style="s2">sort of response aspect of how we come</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.119" end="00:00:37.370" style="s2">to terms with and ultimately move</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.820" end="00:00:41.870" style="s2">through ameliorate as you put it that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.370" end="00:00:48.160" style="s2">perennial problems we face mm-hmm and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.870" end="00:00:48.160" style="s2">log is one of many modes of expression</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.370" end="00:01:00.040" style="s2">experience response that we might take</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.300" end="00:01:04.009" style="s2">to these perennial problems and and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.040" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">was trying to trying to fill back in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.009" end="00:01:17.719" style="s2">sort of drop in to where where we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:20.899" style="s2">now yeah I&#39;ve been engaging we do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.719" end="00:01:22.460" style="s2">series a lot to the last few days and</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.899" end="00:01:23.780" style="s2">thank you yeah I&#39;ve actually been</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.460" end="00:01:25.729" style="s2">listening to you on occasion</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.780" end="00:01:28.340" style="s2">double-time so I&#39;m hoping that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.729" end="00:01:29.810" style="s2">conversation will be a little bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.340" end="00:01:31.729" style="s2">for you to follow along it&#39;s funny when</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.810" end="00:01:33.770" style="s2">you lose but you flip back from double</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.729" end="00:01:37.719" style="s2">time to single it like whoo oh it feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.770" end="00:01:40.909" style="s2">so slow for a few seconds yeah yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.719" end="00:01:42.229" style="s2">but it&#39;s the double time was was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.909" end="00:01:43.939" style="s2">literally just to get through some</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.229" end="00:01:46.459" style="s2">things I thought I need to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.939" end="00:01:48.859" style="s2">that there are key pieces I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.459" end="00:01:51.170" style="s2">out on here before we saw a speak mmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.859" end="00:01:54.289" style="s2">and I definitely prefer that the single</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.170" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">time version of it and you know Jonas</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.289" end="00:02:01.369" style="s2">it&#39;s um it&#39;s a challenging thing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:04.700" style="s2">this might bring us to a point of sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.369" end="00:02:06.679" style="s2">of articulating some of the productive</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.700" end="00:02:08.240" style="s2">nature of dialogue but also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.679" end="00:02:11.989" style="s2">conditions which sort of have to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.240" end="00:02:13.670" style="s2">present to engage in it because what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.989" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">feeling right now just to speak on my</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.670" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:22.260" style="s2">is a mixture of extreme gratitude for</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:26.660" style="s2">the opportunity to dialogue with you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.260" end="00:02:30.950" style="s2">also feeling the tremendous breadth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.660" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">the whole series and an interest to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.950" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">speak to that dynamic and context so</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got as much as we possibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:43.020" style="s2">can have on the table between us so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:46.350" style="s2">we can in some sense both together</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.020" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">orient towards what might be of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.350" end="00:02:50.310" style="s2">mutual interest to explore and so much</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">of what you explore I find deeply</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.310" end="00:02:58.880" style="s2">important and and crucial for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2">personally to gain further insight and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.880" end="00:03:04.320" style="s2">familiarity with so that I can in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:09.140" style="s2">collaboration with others build the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.320" end="00:03:13.800" style="s2">kinds of communities and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.140" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">experiences that facilitate some of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.800" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">deep development that is part and parcel</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.320" style="s2">of meeting and responding to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">crisis and so there&#39;s all of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.320" end="00:03:26.459" style="s2">breadth and then there&#39;s at the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:29.459" style="s2">time when it comes to dialogue a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.459" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">sense of a certain sense of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.459" end="00:03:36.990" style="s2">smoothness and being just where we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:39.780" style="s2">and and so in some meta way I this is me</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.990" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">I&#39;m suppose expressing to you a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:46.920" style="s2">bit of where I am which is gradually</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">feeling into a way in here and so if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.920" end="00:03:50.840" style="s2">draw into a question</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.940" end="00:04:01.940" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.870" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">where do you feel this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.550" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a Socratic dialogue but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:15.240" style="s2">also I sense a bit more of an intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:18.660" style="s2">to what you&#39;re exploring could you uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.240" end="00:04:20.640" style="s2">could you articulate how that is alive</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.660" end="00:04:25.890" style="s2">for you at the moment and how you feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.640" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">that this may be an important practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.890" end="00:04:33.240" style="s2">to situate within our ecology of ways we</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">can develop and ameliorate and move</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.240" end="00:04:40.440" style="s2">through some of the perennial problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">we face as existential beings oh great I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.440" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">think that&#39;s an excellent question</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:45.630" style="s2">before I address the question I first</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">want to respond</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.630" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">I really appreciated your careful I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">that in a very positive sense you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">very careful articulation of how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:00.690" style="s2">framing the framing you&#39;re bringing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:03.960" style="s2">bear into this interaction I thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.690" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">that was a very very helpful thing for</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.960" end="00:05:09.900" style="s2">me and I think also very very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:11.370" style="s2">for potential listeners so I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.900" end="00:05:14.370" style="s2">to say thank you for doing that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.370" end="00:05:16.110" style="s2">taking the time that&#39;s in my mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.370" end="00:05:17.640" style="s2">analogous to the importance they give to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:19.350" style="s2">problem formulation it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.640" end="00:05:21.419" style="s2">dialogue formulation how are we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.350" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">formulating the dialogue before we</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.419" end="00:05:25.560" style="s2">immediately leap in and try to solve or</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:27.620" style="s2">resolve or whatever we&#39;re gonna do in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.560" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">the dialogue spending that time to first</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.620" end="00:05:33.720" style="s2">formulate the dialogue explicate it make</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">sure that we share we have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.720" end="00:05:37.650" style="s2">commitment to this formulation so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:39.870" style="s2">think that right but I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.650" end="00:05:41.220" style="s2">exemplary thing you just did so I want</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.870" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">to commend you on that I want to express</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.220" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">my appreciation for that in both senses</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">of the word like the gratitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:51.270" style="s2">understanding for why you did that so</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:54.540" style="s2">thank you very much for that and that of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.270" end="00:05:55.500" style="s2">course is a nice segue into your</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.540" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">question the question that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.500" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">actually posed to me huh so a bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:07.229" style="s2">genealogy of how it emerged and and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:11.100" style="s2">will give me a way of getting a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.229" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2">bit better where it&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.100" end="00:06:17.140" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been I mean in conjunction with</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:18.430" style="s2">the awakening from the meaning crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.140" end="00:06:20.190" style="s2">course I&#39;ve been talking a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.430" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">this need for an ecology practice</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">ecology practices you know setting up</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:30.330" style="s2">counterbalancing self-organizing systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:33.070" style="s2">of cyclic tech in order to as you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.330" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">ameliorate the printing of problems and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.070" end="00:06:37.780" style="s2">perhaps also enhance and afford</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:40.060" style="s2">increased sense of senses of connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.780" end="00:06:44.380" style="s2">to himself to other people to the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.060" end="00:06:46.390" style="s2">all of that and I was in I wanted a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.380" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">partial another motive for this is also</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.390" end="00:06:50.380" style="s2">give appropriate credit and it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:53.170" style="s2">not just a moral thing I&#39;m doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.380" end="00:06:55.660" style="s2">trying to also show the role the vital</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.170" end="00:06:57.250" style="s2">role of distributed cognition in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.660" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">work we&#39;re doing that often gets masked</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.250" end="00:07:02.050" style="s2">by kind of individualistic ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:04.690" style="s2">I want to challenge not only what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.050" end="00:07:08.530" style="s2">saying but in what I&#39;m exemplifying so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.690" end="00:07:12.100" style="s2">was in one of these kinds of discussions</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.530" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">with somebody who I&#39;ve who&#39;s I&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.100" end="00:07:17.980" style="s2">to have a lot of affection for deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:20.140" style="s2">appreciation for Jordan Hall Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.980" end="00:07:21.880" style="s2">especially important for the manner in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.140" end="00:07:23.710" style="s2">which he converses I&#39;m not saying he</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.880" end="00:07:25.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have great ideas he does he has</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.710" end="00:07:28.180" style="s2">great insights but people tend to focus</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.750" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">a little too rapidly on content and not</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.180" end="00:07:31.870" style="s2">pay enough attention to the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.570" style="s2">doing all this really important work</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.870" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">again around the manner and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.570" end="00:07:38.530" style="s2">formulation of the dialogue so I was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:41.080" style="s2">discussion with him and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.530" end="00:07:43.150" style="s2">get out of his notion of coherence we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.080" end="00:07:44.650" style="s2">comparing it yeah and he had this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.150" end="00:07:47.290" style="s2">insight he said well what I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.650" end="00:07:49.720" style="s2">pointing towards is the need for a meta</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.290" end="00:07:53.740" style="s2">psychic technology whose role it is is</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.720" end="00:07:56.920" style="s2">to help generate curate and organize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.740" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">the the ecology of cyclic technology so</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.920" end="00:08:00.550" style="s2">I used this sort of metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:02.890" style="s2">shepherding we need something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.550" end="00:08:04.570" style="s2">Shepherds it and I thought and I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.890" end="00:08:06.010" style="s2">that just struck me as oh wow that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.570" end="00:08:07.930" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of that&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.010" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">insight and it was in my mind there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.930" end="00:08:12.070" style="s2">relationship between our individuals</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:15.250" style="s2">cultivate wisdom and you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.070" end="00:08:18.910" style="s2">write that this needed Metta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.250" end="00:08:20.680" style="s2">technology so then I got thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.910" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">then I realized that the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.680" end="00:08:23.590" style="s2">had something deeply analogous to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:26.020" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.590" end="00:08:28.360" style="s2">the practice of dialectic which came out</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.020" end="00:08:29.260" style="s2">of Socratic and Linkous and it ramifies</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.360" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">through Plato</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.260" end="00:08:32.770" style="s2">and then it goes in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:35.310" style="s2">important directions in them Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.770" end="00:08:37.090" style="s2">a tradition now the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.310" end="00:08:38.650" style="s2">dialectic and if you read the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.090" end="00:08:40.390" style="s2">neoplatonist it&#39;s very clear that it had</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.650" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">this status of being a meta psychic</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.390" end="00:08:44.920" style="s2">technology it is sort of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.250" end="00:08:47.590" style="s2">practice you do so you know how to best</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.920" end="00:08:49.240" style="s2">do the other practices and curate and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.590" end="00:08:51.070" style="s2">coordinate them together and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.240" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">interesting thing about the dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.070" end="00:08:55.330" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s both something you do as an</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:57.210" style="s2">individual sort of ontological II and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.330" end="00:08:59.800" style="s2">then something you do with other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.210" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">discursive ly and that these are these</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.800" end="00:09:04.390" style="s2">two dimensions are integrated in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:06.910" style="s2">powerful way so well all I was saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.390" end="00:09:08.680" style="s2">well I should I should better understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.910" end="00:09:10.540" style="s2">that because that would serve as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.680" end="00:09:12.340" style="s2">valuable template for trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.540" end="00:09:14.110" style="s2">understand what what Jordan was talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.340" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">about and then and and it was of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.110" end="00:09:17.350" style="s2">deeply enmeshed with the wisdom project</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:20.710" style="s2">which was the connection I was seeking</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.350" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">so then I thought oh that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.710" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">interesting because that also ties in</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:27.040" style="s2">with this stuff that&#39;s also been</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:29.580" style="s2">happening you can see it up for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.040" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">on rebel wisdom about the rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.580" end="00:09:34.540" style="s2">the power of the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:36.610" style="s2">that is generated by distributed</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.540" end="00:09:39.670" style="s2">cognition and you know there&#39;s now some</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.610" end="00:09:41.500" style="s2">you know even some hard science a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.670" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">bit some of its ghastly about the power</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.500" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">of distributed cognition like they</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:48.700" style="s2">directly linked to brain a rat brains</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:51.010" style="s2">together and and and that collectivity</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">can solve problems that individual rats</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.010" end="00:09:55.540" style="s2">can&#39;t solve with the computational power</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:56.740" style="s2">right right and then there&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.540" end="00:09:58.180" style="s2">stuff about the brain synchrony between</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.740" end="00:09:59.710" style="s2">human beings I won&#39;t get into the nuts</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.180" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">and bolts of it so there&#39;s all this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.710" end="00:10:04.510" style="s2">emerging stuff and then I thought oh and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:07.030" style="s2">then I and then I got to meet somebody</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.510" end="00:10:08.350" style="s2">else who I&#39;m forming a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.030" end="00:10:10.870" style="s2">friendship with you just talked to him</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.350" end="00:10:13.030" style="s2">guys in stock and you know at the so</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.870" end="00:10:14.530" style="s2">there&#39;s all these emerging psycho</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.030" end="00:10:17.170" style="s2">technologies and especially guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.530" end="00:10:19.210" style="s2">circling because guys circling is so</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.170" end="00:10:21.490" style="s2">impregnated with the wisdom project of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:23.350" style="s2">Heidi garyun and existential philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.490" end="00:10:26.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.350" end="00:10:28.810" style="s2">right I&#39;m talking about as something</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.440" end="00:10:30.460" style="s2">that has analogous elements with ancient</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.810" end="00:10:31.810" style="s2">dialectic so I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.460" end="00:10:35.770" style="s2">engaging with the help of peter</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.810" end="00:10:36.730" style="s2">lindbergh and the wonderful people in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.770" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">my circling group so I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.730" end="00:10:39.329" style="s2">participant</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:43.870" style="s2">observation learning some of these other</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.329" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">discourse modalities did some empathy</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.870" end="00:10:48.700" style="s2">circling recently uploaded that video</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.029" style="s2">doing some insight gonna do some inside</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.700" end="00:10:51.310" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.029" end="00:10:55.209" style="s2">anyways learning all of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.310" end="00:10:57.490" style="s2">so it struck me that dialectic was also</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.209" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">the machinery in the ancient world by</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.490" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">which people were tailoring themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:04.930" style="s2">to and entering into right the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">collective intelligence of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.930" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">cognition and they often spoke of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">in religious terms what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.940" end="00:11:13.810" style="s2">interesting to me that when I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:15.850" style="s2">circling practice for example is how</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.810" end="00:11:19.269" style="s2">spontaneously people often from very</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.850" end="00:11:20.589" style="s2">secular orientation will will thought</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.269" end="00:11:22.630" style="s2">will find themselves using very</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.589" end="00:11:24.310" style="s2">spiritual even religious terms to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.630" end="00:11:26.769" style="s2">about the phenomenology and the change</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.310" end="00:11:29.890" style="s2">and functionality that&#39;s occurring in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.769" end="00:11:32.290" style="s2">these practices so I just saw that as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.890" end="00:11:34.209" style="s2">massive convergence I saw okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.290" end="00:11:35.740" style="s2">all this stuff going on about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.209" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">collective intelligence and distributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.740" end="00:11:38.230" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:39.880" style="s2">here&#39;s ancient dialectic and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.230" end="00:11:42.730" style="s2">these new and wonderful texts being</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.880" end="00:11:44.890" style="s2">generated around this like sera sera a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.730" end="00:11:47.529" style="s2">rapid book on Socrates for example is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.890" end="00:11:48.610" style="s2">just amazing and they&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.529" end="00:11:50.709" style="s2">there&#39;s that the coordination with</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.610" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">Jordans idea about the meta psychic</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.709" end="00:11:55.149" style="s2">technology and and then they&#39;re like I</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:58.930" style="s2">said it struck me that well what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.149" end="00:12:00.670" style="s2">could do is we could and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.930" end="00:12:03.190" style="s2">gonna do in the next series we could</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.670" end="00:12:06.279" style="s2">explore right now all these current</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.190" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">emerging biological practices put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.279" end="00:12:10.329" style="s2">into dialogue and I don&#39;t mean that as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">pun I mean that as a real thing put that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.329" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">into dialogue with what I can get what</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.260" style="s2">if I could get glean from an garner for</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.630" style="s2">the practice of ancient dialectic and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.260" end="00:12:21.579" style="s2">see if we can then bring you know some</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.630" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">elucidation some clarification some</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.579" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">insight some advancement of the project</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.880" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">because here&#39;s here&#39;s that here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:30.339" style="s2">key idea just like individual</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:32.589" style="s2">intelligence needs to be exhausted up</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.339" end="00:12:34.420" style="s2">into rationality and then that exact</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.589" end="00:12:36.790" style="s2">that up into wisdom we need to take</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.420" end="00:12:39.220" style="s2">collective intelligence and ratchet that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.790" end="00:12:41.380" style="s2">out into collective rationality and in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.220" end="00:12:42.959" style="s2">connective wisdom collective wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.380" end="00:12:45.310" style="s2">those two projects are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.959" end="00:12:48.100" style="s2">interpenetrating and so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.310" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">think we need in order to get to you the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.100" end="00:12:51.250" style="s2">meta secular technology so I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:52.899" style="s2">lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.250" end="00:12:54.310" style="s2">with Christopher master Pietro by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.899" end="00:12:56.050" style="s2">way you should have him on your you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:59.110" style="s2">should have Yujin interview Chris right</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.050" end="00:13:01.300" style="s2">I so Chris and I are writing a chapter</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.110" end="00:13:02.889" style="s2">for the meta modern anthology on just</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.300" end="00:13:06.310" style="s2">the stuff you were talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.889" end="00:13:08.379" style="s2">also going into the the book we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.310" end="00:13:10.149" style="s2">working on so there so I&#39;m doing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.379" end="00:13:12.100" style="s2">of work with Chris right now to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.149" end="00:13:14.680" style="s2">nail down some of the theory and doing a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.100" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">lot of work with Peter on the imputed</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.680" end="00:13:18.879" style="s2">Limburg investing investigating it with</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.810" end="00:13:23.319" style="s2">to this participant observation reading</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.879" end="00:13:26.339" style="s2">the literature together so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.319" end="00:13:28.540" style="s2">of people we&#39;re all working together</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.540" end="00:13:33.699" style="s2">in collaboration some of it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.670" end="00:13:35.829" style="s2">network that I&#39;m contributing to to try</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.699" end="00:13:38.470" style="s2">and I think get this I know that guy for</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.939" end="00:13:53.439" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s why I&#39;m sort of getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.120" end="00:13:55.000" style="s2">very excited right now because there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:10.149" style="s2">to help in advance this kind of meta</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.670" end="00:14:29.319" style="s2">and I asked for forbearance from all</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.790" end="00:14:30.939" style="s2">your listeners and your viewers because</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.319" end="00:14:33.250" style="s2">this is very much a work in progress</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.250" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">work on now trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.319" end="00:14:39.430" style="s2">phenomenology and the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:42.430" style="s2">all of this worked out but this is where</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.430" end="00:14:43.990" style="s2">this is where it&#39;s at like yeah oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.430" end="00:14:45.879" style="s2">beautiful John thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.990" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">that answer that was that was that was</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:15:01.930" style="s2">about it and will continue to be</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.930" end="00:15:07.180" style="s2">person online and then around the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.120" end="00:15:09.400" style="s2">in person eventually when I get off and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.180" end="00:15:13.240" style="s2">away from here for just a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.400" end="00:15:17.650" style="s2">be doing exactly that it&#39;s some attempt</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.240" end="00:15:20.410" style="s2">to move into insight practice in a co</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.650" end="00:15:25.090" style="s2">participatory way this this is this</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.290" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">it a fair formulation to think about a</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.010" end="00:16:00.550" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent way of putting it I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.510" end="00:16:02.350" style="s2">think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s participatory in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.550" end="00:16:04.720" style="s2">both if you&#39;ll allow me the metaphor is</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:10.510" style="s2">within a person because there&#39;s a sense</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">already to some degree active in you you</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.460" end="00:16:14.860" style="s2">need it to start to get into it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:16.480" style="s2">like a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.860" end="00:16:18.190" style="s2">if you it&#39;s like you need you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.480" end="00:16:20.230" style="s2">you need a bit of honesty to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.190" end="00:16:22.120" style="s2">more of honesty and that&#39;s sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.230" end="00:16:25.270" style="s2">you need that germinating spark kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.120" end="00:16:26.770" style="s2">idea so I think you all altima lyon lee</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.270" end="00:16:28.270" style="s2">know this kind of wisdom by</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.770" end="00:16:30.940" style="s2">participating in it and then like you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.270" end="00:16:32.530" style="s2">said it&#39;s very much also and this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.940" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">what this is what has such some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.530" end="00:16:37.480" style="s2">most powerful phenomenological effects</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">on people that sense of that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.480" end="00:16:40.900" style="s2">often called the Wiis face the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:44.020" style="s2">participation in some right some</p>

<p begin="00:16:44.020" end="00:16:47.080" style="s2">presence I&#39;ve got to be careful where</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.060" end="00:16:48.850" style="s2">with my language because I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.080" end="00:16:50.950" style="s2">invoke you know weird a weird</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.850" end="00:16:53.530" style="s2">metaphysics but you get this you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.950" end="00:16:56.440" style="s2">this we face that is not reducible to</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.530" end="00:16:59.290" style="s2">any one particular individual cognition</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.440" end="00:17:01.030" style="s2">and so and your relationship to it one</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.290" end="00:17:03.459" style="s2">is one a participation it&#39;s not other</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.030" end="00:17:06.459" style="s2">than you but it&#39;s not identical to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.459" end="00:17:09.279" style="s2">you participate in it and and it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.459" end="00:17:12.429" style="s2">didn&#39;t mean and again that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.279" end="00:17:14.049" style="s2">harkens back to you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.429" end="00:17:15.520" style="s2">theoretic language it&#39;s I mean and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.049" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">even survives in some of her metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.520" end="00:17:19.539" style="s2">we talk about team spirit well at one</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:22.120" style="s2">point that was really a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.539" end="00:17:24.520" style="s2">thing it wasn&#39;t just sort of Yoho right</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.120" end="00:17:25.959" style="s2">it was us and right so when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.520" end="00:17:28.089" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something like circling you</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.959" end="00:17:30.159" style="s2">yeah you get that but it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.089" end="00:17:34.779" style="s2">metaphor for our shared commitment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.159" end="00:17:37.299" style="s2">the extent aesthetic experience of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.779" end="00:17:40.659" style="s2">know of the dynamical system that has</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.299" end="00:17:42.580" style="s2">taken shape between all the people</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.659" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">involved and and that and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.580" end="00:17:50.500" style="s2">power it has to alter and shift</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:53.409" style="s2">individual cognition so yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:55.630" style="s2">that that that it&#39;s a it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.409" end="00:17:57.460" style="s2">participatory in both with Ian you you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.630" end="00:17:59.110" style="s2">have to read you like you have to be it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.460" end="00:18:02.169" style="s2">you can&#39;t just think about it you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.110" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">to embody it and then it&#39;s also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.169" end="00:18:06.549" style="s2">participatory in that you have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:09.279" style="s2">relationship to the we space all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.549" end="00:18:11.620" style="s2">the that is again it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.279" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">other and it&#39;s not me it&#39;s not I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.620" end="00:18:15.610" style="s2">it&#39;s we so it&#39;s deeply it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:19.240" style="s2">phenomenology is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.610" end="00:18:21.940" style="s2">participatory in nature mmm-hmm and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.240" end="00:18:23.409" style="s2">as you said what that&#39;s all directed</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.940" end="00:18:25.299" style="s2">towards and what I want to even more</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.409" end="00:18:28.809" style="s2">directed towards with the help of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.299" end="00:18:31.419" style="s2">like Jordan and guy and Chris is as you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.809" end="00:18:34.630" style="s2">said towards the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.419" end="00:18:36.340" style="s2">collective cultivation of wisdom so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.630" end="00:18:37.659" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s the subtitle so</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.340" end="00:18:41.649" style="s2">there&#39;s the next series is after</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.659" end="00:18:45.909" style="s2">Socrates the pursuit of wisdom through</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.649" end="00:18:48.520" style="s2">authentic dialogue mmm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.909" end="00:18:50.730" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that battle seems right to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.520" end="00:18:50.730" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.920" end="00:19:05.010" style="s2">so I wonder if this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.380" end="00:19:08.190" style="s2">way in because okay okay so so in one</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.010" end="00:19:10.020" style="s2">sense it seems like where we are to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.190" end="00:19:13.950" style="s2">in dialogue which neither of us know</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.020" end="00:19:17.670" style="s2">right now is in some sense is substance</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.950" end="00:19:20.930" style="s2">emergent and in another sense its latent</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.670" end="00:19:23.250" style="s2">already in each of us individually our</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.930" end="00:19:27.630" style="s2">current maps of making sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.250" end="00:19:29.490" style="s2">and also our orientation and way we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.630" end="00:19:33.420" style="s2">willing to be that and show up and</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.490" end="00:19:35.850" style="s2">embody that and to be continuous between</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.420" end="00:19:37.380" style="s2">that proposition and participatory level</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.850" end="00:19:39.060" style="s2">when to the extent we can generate the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.380" end="00:19:41.100" style="s2">perspective of knowing so we can both</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.060" end="00:19:43.740" style="s2">participate in that to the extent I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.100" end="00:19:48.050" style="s2">the words right in to procedurally be</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.740" end="00:19:53.550" style="s2">able to do that as well we are we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.050" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">here at this opening and I&#39;d like to I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.550" end="00:19:59.190" style="s2">like to present a little bit about where</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:20:00.840" style="s2">I feel myself ultimately going and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.190" end="00:20:02.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we have to go there right</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.840" end="00:20:04.350" style="s2">now there&#39;s this there&#39;s this balance</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.430" end="00:20:06.750" style="s2">sighs there&#39;s this balance that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.350" end="00:20:09.900" style="s2">important to hold isn&#39;t it between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.750" end="00:20:12.660" style="s2">being well being where we are and being</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.900" end="00:20:15.720" style="s2">and ultimately actually my my</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.660" end="00:20:18.810" style="s2">fundamental goal here is to be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.720" end="00:20:21.180" style="s2">in a collaborative way towards that very</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.180" end="00:20:27.720" style="s2">talk to you about how that project</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.910" end="00:20:29.460" style="s2">relates to a lot of how I am driven to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.720" end="00:20:31.410" style="s2">show up in the world and broadly</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.460" end="00:20:34.050" style="s2">speaking these collaborations toward the</p>

<p begin="00:20:34.050" end="00:20:39.930" style="s2">wisdom enable the development of psycho</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.250" end="00:20:45.570" style="s2">based on the sovereign choice of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.830" end="00:20:47.070" style="s2">individuals to move towards that in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.570" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">their life and to realize a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.070" end="00:20:50.340" style="s2">connection to themselves each other and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:51.750" style="s2">the world well we also make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.340" end="00:20:54.710" style="s2">where we&#39;re at in our collective moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.750" end="00:21:00.150" style="s2">for me this is absolutely essential and</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.710" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">serving that is what my primary aim is</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.150" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">yet that is if that is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:05.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a live project and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:09.240" style="s2">we have the moment of this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.820" end="00:21:12.029" style="s2">I have my individual places of where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.240" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">at with considering for example some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.029" end="00:21:19.230" style="s2">the deeper metaphysical aspects to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:21.179" style="s2">theorizing because your theorizing has</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.230" end="00:21:23.700" style="s2">been so important to me you&#39;re a key</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.179" end="00:21:26.909" style="s2">influencer of mine because of me for</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.700" end="00:21:29.429" style="s2">many beautiful ways it&#39;s we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.909" end="00:21:31.320" style="s2">time to talk about it precisely today</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.429" end="00:21:34.110" style="s2">and so there&#39;s all of these aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.320" end="00:21:36.360" style="s2">myself that in some sense are desiring</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.110" end="00:21:39.450" style="s2">to presents themselves yet there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.360" end="00:21:42.139" style="s2">thread that if I tend to it is also one</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.450" end="00:21:44.700" style="s2">that can be between us that is mutually</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.139" end="00:21:45.029" style="s2">interesting and revelatory for both of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.700" end="00:21:47.010" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.029" end="00:21:49.529" style="s2">I think what you&#39;re doing right now is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:50.399" style="s2">already extremely helpful so the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.529" end="00:21:52.590" style="s2">interesting one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.399" end="00:21:54.899" style="s2">dimensions that I call it the theory a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.590" end="00:21:57.090" style="s2">theory dimension so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.899" end="00:22:00.539" style="s2">we&#39;re doing in this practice is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.090" end="00:22:02.220" style="s2">constantly moving right and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.539" end="00:22:04.049" style="s2">matter of the way in which attention and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.220" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">perspectival knowing or shifting right</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.049" end="00:22:08.610" style="s2">but we&#39;re constantly moving between</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.600" end="00:22:11.490" style="s2">theory in which we advance propositional</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.610" end="00:22:12.840" style="s2">arguments right and then but then then</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.490" end="00:22:14.850" style="s2">we do what you just did we step back</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:17.700" style="s2">into the-- Oriya which is we step back</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.850" end="00:22:20.730" style="s2">into a contemplative frame in which</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.700" end="00:22:23.940" style="s2">we&#39;re again ok where are we what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.730" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">agent arena you know set up here how are</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.940" end="00:22:27.539" style="s2">we formulating the dialogue and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:28.950" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing there is we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.539" end="00:22:30.690" style="s2">to come alive - we&#39;re trying to increase</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.950" end="00:22:33.059" style="s2">our sensitivity and transform our</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.690" end="00:22:35.429" style="s2">Sensibility so we can sense the Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.059" end="00:22:36.750" style="s2">so we can sense like the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.429" end="00:22:38.370" style="s2">this is shifting and directing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.750" end="00:22:39.870" style="s2">there&#39;s so much finesse here if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.370" end="00:22:42.510" style="s2">about it almost like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.870" end="00:22:44.340" style="s2">musicality and you&#39;re trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.510" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">rhythm you&#39;re trying to sense the tone</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.340" end="00:22:48.389" style="s2">and so you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:51.090" style="s2">consciously shift into the OREA - sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.389" end="00:22:53.010" style="s2">and also your but it&#39;s it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.090" end="00:22:54.330" style="s2">sensing thing there&#39;s an aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.010" end="00:22:55.950" style="s2">thing you&#39;re also you&#39;re also training</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.330" end="00:22:58.350" style="s2">your sensibility like music appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.950" end="00:23:00.120" style="s2">so you&#39;re doing this sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.350" end="00:23:03.269" style="s2">transforming your sensibility to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.120" end="00:23:05.970" style="s2">on the musicality of the dialogue so</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.269" end="00:23:08.669" style="s2">that when you come back in it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.970" end="00:23:10.350" style="s2">you and the other person both of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.669" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">like are sharing this commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.350" end="00:23:14.730" style="s2">what&#39;s emerging between you so first of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:17.220" style="s2">all I think what you just did about</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.730" end="00:23:18.870" style="s2">right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.220" end="00:23:20.850" style="s2">I think this is a vital and I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.870" end="00:23:23.130" style="s2">that word to try and resonate with as</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.850" end="00:23:25.230" style="s2">many meanings impossible with it I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.130" end="00:23:27.659" style="s2">what you just did is a vital thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.230" end="00:23:29.399" style="s2">that theory theory a shift and I was</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.659" end="00:23:31.549" style="s2">talking to Jordan about this I would see</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.399" end="00:23:33.570" style="s2">and and and about how it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.549" end="00:23:35.850" style="s2">sensitizing but also transforming</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.570" end="00:23:37.830" style="s2">sensibility to pick up on the musicality</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.850" end="00:23:39.809" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s just like I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.830" end="00:23:42.149" style="s2">that&#39;s actually vital to what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.809" end="00:23:45.059" style="s2">trying to do here right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.149" end="00:23:47.309" style="s2">important therefore it for people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.059" end="00:23:49.169" style="s2">are interested in what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.309" end="00:23:52.230" style="s2">about to pay attention to this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.169" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">exemplification and not just the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.230" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">explicit content of our propositions so</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:59.159" style="s2">I think that that was a bit that was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">very that that for me that see that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.159" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">the kind of thing I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:05.940" style="s2">right now I&#39;m trying to get at like</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:08.279" style="s2">what&#39;s in practice what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.940" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">transformations of the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.279" end="00:24:12.929" style="s2">that tell us something about how to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:16.409" style="s2">access and transform the funk underlying</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.929" end="00:24:18.389" style="s2">functionality and and so just here just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.409" end="00:24:21.690" style="s2">now you doing that in fact that you did</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.389" end="00:24:24.630" style="s2">it so spontaneously and so well is it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.690" end="00:24:27.059" style="s2">exact exactly the kind of thing that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.630" end="00:24:32.700" style="s2">very interested in and and I think is as</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.059" end="00:24:35.010" style="s2">I say vital to trying to to get this the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.700" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">idea and even the metaphor you had of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.010" end="00:24:39.299" style="s2">the thread is so good because right</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:42.659" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which you know you</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.299" end="00:24:45.149" style="s2">have you have to you to really play with</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.659" end="00:24:46.919" style="s2">salience to in the midst of all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.149" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">other things to find the thread and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.919" end="00:24:50.580" style="s2">then there&#39;s a kind of diligence and a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:54.570" style="s2">respect that you have to set yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.580" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">into to to follow the thread so yes I</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:24:58.380" style="s2">think all of that is important and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:00.299" style="s2">here&#39;s another word I want to use with</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.380" end="00:25:02.700" style="s2">as much resonance as possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.299" end="00:25:05.250" style="s2">important to invoke all of this on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.700" end="00:25:08.010" style="s2">regular and reliable basis rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.250" end="00:25:16.129" style="s2">simply referring to it hmm</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.010" end="00:25:19.710" style="s2">yes yes yes there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.129" end="00:25:22.110" style="s2">so I&#39;m let me see if I can use the term</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.710" end="00:25:24.119" style="s2">furia here a little bit in practice so</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.110" end="00:25:27.059" style="s2">that I can further get it it&#39;s not every</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.119" end="00:25:41.009" style="s2">day that conversations are available to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.059" end="00:25:45.230" style="s2">use the word theoria in okay so well so</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.009" end="00:25:45.230" style="s2">this is a different way in there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.519" end="00:25:54.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a movement towards an to write</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.009" end="00:25:56.190" style="s2">an unscripted mode because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.889" end="00:25:59.159" style="s2">necessity</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.190" end="00:26:03.720" style="s2">I feel the language is appropriate I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.159" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">feel to to presence actually and gently</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.720" end="00:26:13.590" style="s2">as we have almost an opponent processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:17.190" style="s2">towards it yes we have an opponent</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.590" end="00:26:19.259" style="s2">processing towards the appropriate place</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.190" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">of vulnerability and that vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.259" end="00:26:26.759" style="s2">is more but the vulnerabilities involved</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:27.389" style="s2">and that vulnerability from me in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.759" end="00:26:31.289" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.389" end="00:26:33.509" style="s2">especially when we are skimming along</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.289" end="00:26:37.590" style="s2">the surface of what our deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.509" end="00:26:41.129" style="s2">metaphysical cogs and highly direct</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.590" end="00:26:44.549" style="s2">ontology and epistemology is these are</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.129" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">the kinds of vulnerabilities that can in</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.549" end="00:26:48.450" style="s2">fact as you speak about so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:52.710" style="s2">me in one of your lecture episodes</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.450" end="00:26:54.419" style="s2">invoke a sense of horror if they are yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.710" end="00:26:56.519" style="s2">miss play or if they are dislodged</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.419" end="00:26:59.190" style="s2">without the right bounds of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.519" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">I&#39;m very attuned to this and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.190" end="00:27:06.090" style="s2">actually have considerable experience in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:07.710" style="s2">deep metaphysical unsettling and</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.710" end="00:27:14.759" style="s2">unsettling over the course of many years</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.009" end="00:27:17.759" style="s2">and in that sense I feel ready to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.759" end="00:27:19.559" style="s2">here and do this but there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.759" end="00:27:23.820" style="s2">which when I&#39;m talking about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.559" end="00:27:25.890" style="s2">I I realize how effectively Laden I am</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:27.900" style="s2">- presents my words and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.890" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">affective component that you also speak</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.900" end="00:27:32.160" style="s2">about an awful lot as being a key</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:34.070" style="s2">characterization of how we should</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.160" end="00:27:37.110" style="s2">understand relevance realization oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.070" end="00:27:38.910" style="s2">totally I mean it&#39;s the the coping of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:40.770" style="s2">relevance realization is in separately</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.910" end="00:27:43.590" style="s2">bound up with a primordial kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.770" end="00:27:46.470" style="s2">caring yes beautiful carrot it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.590" end="00:27:48.860" style="s2">precisely that and for me I was using</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.470" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">the language of an affective relation</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.860" end="00:27:53.310" style="s2">before I became so acquainted with your</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:55.680" style="s2">work to express to myself that there was</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.310" end="00:27:57.450" style="s2">some important contrast between an</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.680" end="00:27:59.580" style="s2">intellectual way of going at the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.450" end="00:28:02.280" style="s2">and that in some sense our frames were</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.580" end="00:28:04.890" style="s2">always and already filtered to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:06.660" style="s2">degree by something like and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.890" end="00:28:08.670" style="s2">was influenced a lot by your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.660" end="00:28:10.260" style="s2">before I came to study you a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.670" end="00:28:11.670" style="s2">I had engaged with it a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.260" end="00:28:15.270" style="s2">the time breath at the time relevance</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.670" end="00:28:17.250" style="s2">realization is itself it reveals you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.270" end="00:28:19.380" style="s2">know the more the more you understand of</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.250" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">it the more you can drop the whole just</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.380" end="00:28:23.610" style="s2">through appreciating the terms I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:27.540" style="s2">it&#39;s very very appropriate it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.610" end="00:28:30.540" style="s2">very true thing the right terms is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.540" end="00:28:32.370" style="s2">very important thing to do oh yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.540" end="00:28:35.610" style="s2">and you know and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.370" end="00:28:37.710" style="s2">actually that I think can be afforded</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.610" end="00:28:39.420" style="s2">like the dialogue can help I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.710" end="00:28:41.910" style="s2">spontaneously to generate those terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.420" end="00:28:43.230" style="s2">but it could also be not precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.910" end="00:28:44.550" style="s2">place where you look for them and I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.230" end="00:28:46.350" style="s2">this in my own experience because so</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.550" end="00:28:49.320" style="s2">often I&#39;m looking to communicate that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.350" end="00:28:52.530" style="s2">affective component to to enable this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.320" end="00:28:54.600" style="s2">sense of shared safety and care so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.530" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">will go about expressing things in all</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.600" end="00:28:58.050" style="s2">these different ways coming out of this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.100" end="00:29:00.150" style="s2">like this like this with these different</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.050" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">emotional tones behind it but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.150" end="00:29:02.910" style="s2">kind of I would sit down to write</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:04.680" style="s2">something if I wanted to make something</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.910" end="00:29:06.900" style="s2">analytically tight in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.680" end="00:29:08.940" style="s2">relevance realization has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.900" end="00:29:10.740" style="s2">analytically tight for it to play that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.940" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">role between the cognitive science on</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.740" end="00:29:20.400" style="s2">the one hand and then also the religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.340" end="00:29:21.540" style="s2">yeah so yeah I I think I wanted it to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.400" end="00:29:23.040" style="s2">because you made it a couple of really</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.540" end="00:29:27.630" style="s2">excellent points I did I didn&#39;t want I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.040" end="00:29:29.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t want them to to be left one look</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.630" end="00:29:31.470" style="s2">at the thing you just said I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.700" end="00:29:33.510" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah I think and and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.470" end="00:29:35.620" style="s2">big difference between theorizing which</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.510" end="00:29:37.330" style="s2">I think we need to do and there</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.620" end="00:29:39.940" style="s2">you need those precise terms and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.330" end="00:29:43.180" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t produce until you&#39;ve come to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.940" end="00:29:45.309" style="s2">precision yes I agree with that and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.180" end="00:29:47.680" style="s2">is the appropriate place to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.309" end="00:29:50.680" style="s2">I think to go back to two points you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.680" end="00:29:52.630" style="s2">made about dia logos and I try to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.680" end="00:29:55.150" style="s2">the Greek now by way of the logos</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.630" end="00:29:57.280" style="s2">because their logos right is much more</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.150" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">comprehensive than logic right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.280" end="00:30:01.300" style="s2">the gathering together so that things</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:02.830" style="s2">belong together so but India logos</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.300" end="00:30:04.570" style="s2">there&#39;s two things you said that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.830" end="00:30:07.180" style="s2">very important first we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.570" end="00:30:08.980" style="s2">ourselves on the edge of we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.180" end="00:30:11.770" style="s2">yourself into a system that&#39;s dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.980" end="00:30:14.260" style="s2">and and that is going to have emergent</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.770" end="00:30:15.730" style="s2">features the the ongoing emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.260" end="00:30:18.400" style="s2">what we have not pre-planned or</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.730" end="00:30:21.160" style="s2">prepackaged or pre cognized pre thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.400" end="00:30:23.980" style="s2">right is is again a vital piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.160" end="00:30:26.110" style="s2">next you mentioned about the effectivity</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.980" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">and you mentioned the vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.110" end="00:30:30.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:32.530" style="s2">seeing these coming together because I</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.550" end="00:30:34.929" style="s2">was really I I really liked what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.530" end="00:30:36.100" style="s2">when you and I were talking about for</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.929" end="00:30:39.580" style="s2">the distinction between ball in the bill</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.100" end="00:30:40.929" style="s2">and exposure that had come up guy and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.580" end="00:30:43.179" style="s2">talked a bit about that and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.929" end="00:30:46.630" style="s2">he talked to her at length with Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.179" end="00:30:49.540" style="s2">about that because it&#39;s it&#39;s this notion</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.630" end="00:30:51.990" style="s2">again of sensitization right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.540" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">difference when you&#39;re exposed right</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:57.520" style="s2">what did you actually what the response</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:31:00.910" style="s2">is to is it is a hardening right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.520" end="00:31:02.290" style="s2">response is a hardening and because what</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.910" end="00:31:04.750" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is defend and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.290" end="00:31:07.630" style="s2">protect yourself from further incursion</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.750" end="00:31:09.280" style="s2">but in vulnerability if we&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.630" end="00:31:10.630" style="s2">as distinct from exposure because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.280" end="00:31:12.970" style="s2">course people use terms in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.630" end="00:31:15.309" style="s2">sloppy ways but if we&#39;re using it in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.970" end="00:31:16.900" style="s2">the distinction vulnerability is a kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.309" end="00:31:20.050" style="s2">of sensitization you&#39;re allowing</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.900" end="00:31:22.120" style="s2">yourself to the things to penetrate into</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.050" end="00:31:24.100" style="s2">you so it comes with that sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.120" end="00:31:26.890" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s exactly where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.100" end="00:31:29.230" style="s2">affective component has to be our guide</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.890" end="00:31:33.370" style="s2">because what our effect is often doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.230" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">is giving us the degree to which our our</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.370" end="00:31:38.770" style="s2">ability to perceive and sense is is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:41.559" style="s2">threatening or the degree to which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.770" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">nourishing our effect is often you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.559" end="00:31:48.070" style="s2">deeply attuned to okay what it what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:50.190" style="s2">what is this doing and so I think being</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.070" end="00:31:53.710" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.190" end="00:31:55.660" style="s2">you know courage and care with</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.710" end="00:31:58.900" style="s2">vulnerability is what affords it to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.660" end="00:32:02.440" style="s2">actually become that sensitivity and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.900" end="00:32:03.970" style="s2">a lot of what we are doing is and again</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.440" end="00:32:05.230" style="s2">to try and you know really make this</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.970" end="00:32:09.160" style="s2">word resonate with people we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.230" end="00:32:10.600" style="s2">to encourage each other and if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.160" end="00:32:12.610" style="s2">allow me to coin a new word we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.600" end="00:32:15.280" style="s2">to in care each other we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.610" end="00:32:19.000" style="s2">create right caring between and within</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.280" end="00:32:22.660" style="s2">each other so that we can that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.000" end="00:32:24.820" style="s2">vulnerability stays at become it stays</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.660" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">as a sensitivity it doesn&#39;t harden into</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.820" end="00:32:34.660" style="s2">a defensive framing of I&#39;m overexposed</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:36.790" style="s2">and then that that in turn you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.660" end="00:32:42.040" style="s2">leads me back to the point you made</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.790" end="00:32:43.330" style="s2">about and this is this is one I hope we</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.040" end="00:32:46.870" style="s2">can spend some time on because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.330" end="00:32:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of that the the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.870" end="00:32:54.400" style="s2">tangled but really juicy part if I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.560" end="00:32:56.290" style="s2">put it that way which is we need we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.400" end="00:32:57.700" style="s2">not we need a place for theorizing let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.290" end="00:32:59.290" style="s2">put that aside I&#39;ve already acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.700" end="00:33:01.270" style="s2">that and I do that and that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.290" end="00:33:03.160" style="s2">and people know that I care about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.270" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna take it that that&#39;s a given</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.160" end="00:33:07.480" style="s2">that we need nothing that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:09.400" style="s2">here challenges any of that or</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.480" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">undermines it in any way but when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.400" end="00:33:16.860" style="s2">doing deal logos right we do need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:20.140" style="s2">bring into it the depths of our ontology</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.860" end="00:33:23.110" style="s2">and you&#39;ll allow me we have this is what</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.140" end="00:33:24.910" style="s2">this is what I see exemplified in Plato</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.110" end="00:33:27.430" style="s2">right you can&#39;t if you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.910" end="00:33:29.350" style="s2">cultivate wisdom and courage and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.430" end="00:33:32.530" style="s2">these are deeply perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.350" end="00:33:35.260" style="s2">participatory things and therefore your</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.530" end="00:33:37.210" style="s2">deepest patterns of intelligibility your</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.260" end="00:33:38.710" style="s2">deepest patterns of coping and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.210" end="00:33:40.360" style="s2">sense-making are always bound up with</p>

<p begin="00:33:40.360" end="00:33:47.140" style="s2">concern and identification and so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.380" end="00:33:50.680" style="s2">if we want this to have existential</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.140" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">depth we have to touch upon the you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.680" end="00:33:57.370" style="s2">the the ontological depths as well and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:59.260" style="s2">so how to do this and you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.370" end="00:34:01.210" style="s2">this is a vital issue in Plato they talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.260" end="00:34:02.950" style="s2">about it in the dialogue how to do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.210" end="00:34:03.320" style="s2">you want to be able to take people even</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.950" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">to up</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.320" end="00:34:07.970" style="s2">aurilla where they&#39;re like ah it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:10.940" style="s2">make sense anymore but but not tip them</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.970" end="00:34:13.490" style="s2">into as you said horror because the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.940" end="00:34:15.080" style="s2">point isn&#39;t to the is is it to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.490" end="00:34:17.150" style="s2">immobilize people because they&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.080" end="00:34:20.180" style="s2">overexposed and they hardened another</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.150" end="00:34:23.030" style="s2">stock what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.180" end="00:34:26.810" style="s2">take that and get them to commit to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.030" end="00:34:29.390" style="s2">so that that becomes Wonder and awe and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.810" end="00:34:32.600" style="s2">it draws them forth in an aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.390" end="00:34:35.660" style="s2">commitment and so that is also part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.600" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">the finesse of the the via logos and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.660" end="00:34:39.170" style="s2">I often describe this to Gaia&#39;s I want</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:41.660" style="s2">to take circling but I want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.170" end="00:34:43.850" style="s2">find Leah Sophia into it and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.660" end="00:34:46.580" style="s2">bring in right so we&#39;re doing all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.850" end="00:34:49.220" style="s2">stuff all this really valuable and rich</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.580" end="00:34:51.740" style="s2">and juicy stuff we&#39;re circling but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.220" end="00:34:54.980" style="s2">but if we get aware of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.740" end="00:34:56.630" style="s2">dimensions can we then bring them in can</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.980" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">we then bring in finally by the assaut</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.630" end="00:34:59.900" style="s2">fiha because the deepest and the I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:02.030" style="s2">guy is all on board about this because</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.900" end="00:35:04.250" style="s2">this is heidegger&#39;s whole thing right</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.030" end="00:35:06.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually explore design</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.250" end="00:35:09.710" style="s2">without exploring being those two are</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.980" end="00:35:12.920" style="s2">bound together in just inseparable</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.710" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">fashion and so um III that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.920" end="00:35:15.950" style="s2">wanted to interrupt you there was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:18.110" style="s2">four really important things you had you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.950" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">had you had canvassed there and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.110" end="00:35:21.650" style="s2">thought they were important to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.490" end="00:35:23.960" style="s2">and open them up and unpack them a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.650" end="00:35:26.180" style="s2">little bit yes thank you for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.960" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">I thought that was beautiful I&#39;m packing</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.180" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">and I continue to invite you to slow me</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:36.290" style="s2">down and do just that and and in many</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:38.420" style="s2">respects the point I was making was one</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.290" end="00:35:41.060" style="s2">that was inviting you to jump in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.420" end="00:35:45.410" style="s2">slow it slow it down because there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.060" end="00:35:48.170" style="s2">much and it needs to be there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.410" end="00:35:49.730" style="s2">time and care to be taken in presencing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.170" end="00:35:51.650" style="s2">that and also we&#39;re recording something</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.730" end="00:35:54.460" style="s2">for the benefit of listeners and viewers</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.650" end="00:35:58.550" style="s2">as well so there&#39;s all these pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.460" end="00:36:01.610" style="s2">and my sense as well as that so the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.550" end="00:36:03.020" style="s2">sorts of meta reflection which not that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.610" end="00:36:04.520" style="s2">theory is precise</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.020" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s a reflection of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.520" end="00:36:09.830" style="s2">it&#39;s but not so much an intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:11.690" style="s2">as it is this bearing forth of where we</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.830" end="00:36:12.660" style="s2">are and our being in the moment which</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.690" end="00:36:16.020" style="s2">can look</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.660" end="00:36:18.619" style="s2">like a type of sort of meta taking once</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.020" end="00:36:30.859" style="s2">out oneself out of the particular frame</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.619" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deeper well</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.859" end="00:36:35.069" style="s2">that is that is a process that should be</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.670" style="s2">gentle that is that is a process that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.069" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">should be gentle and and and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.670" end="00:37:03.150" style="s2">I&#39;d like to continue it so okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:06.200" style="s2">may be interesting to explore is where</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:09.480" style="s2">the perhaps where the jump back into</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.200" end="00:37:11.670" style="s2">theorizing takes place within the space</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.480" end="00:37:15.140" style="s2">of Peoria within the space of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.670" end="00:37:18.690" style="s2">presencing our being this effectively</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.140" end="00:37:21.539" style="s2">cooperatively realizing a shared space</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.690" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">of care and vulnerability so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.539" end="00:37:27.089" style="s2">presence truly what we are as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:29.279" style="s2">can reveal of ourselves in accordance</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.089" end="00:37:32.099" style="s2">with what we can in an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.279" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">fashion and respectful fashion be</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.099" end="00:37:36.359" style="s2">together in a space as appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:38.069" style="s2">the setting and the setting isn&#39;t is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.359" end="00:37:39.510" style="s2">important it&#39;s like not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.069" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">doing this thing we&#39;re also building the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:43.140" style="s2">table this is often what I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:46.109" style="s2">people about it&#39;s like not only not only</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.140" end="00:37:49.170" style="s2">are we present seeing sort of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.109" end="00:37:51.510" style="s2">in this dance at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.170" end="00:37:53.789" style="s2">construction of the table at which this</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.510" end="00:37:56.039" style="s2">kind of conversation can take place of</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.789" end="00:37:58.589" style="s2">course you&#39;re a motorway for so much of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.039" end="00:38:02.339" style="s2">your life but with this with this online</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.589" end="00:38:04.319" style="s2">element right and with this with that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.339" end="00:38:06.930" style="s2">with what seems to me that the genuine</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.319" end="00:38:10.289" style="s2">novelty of this just because of how</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.930" end="00:38:14.549" style="s2">actually of how existentially demanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.289" end="00:38:18.359" style="s2">I truly feel it is to to move at this</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.549" end="00:38:20.789" style="s2">level right there is you know I come at</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.359" end="00:38:23.589" style="s2">this a lot as well from a perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.789" end="00:38:26.710" style="s2">therapy and what education</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.589" end="00:38:29.289" style="s2">Kumiko so let&#39;s let&#39;s press ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.710" end="00:38:31.299" style="s2">trust the trust the process anyway it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.289" end="00:38:34.809" style="s2">it&#39;s really part and parcel of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.299" end="00:38:37.710" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.809" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s this constant dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.710" end="00:38:43.630" style="s2">feeling you know of the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:46.029" style="s2">participate and then also accepting</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.630" end="00:38:48.130" style="s2">precisely where you are and not going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.029" end="00:38:50.440" style="s2">further than it&#39;s just breaching the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.130" end="00:38:53.349" style="s2">boundary yeah and this is a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:55.390" style="s2">my my day to day kind of process but</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.349" end="00:38:59.950" style="s2">where I believe I was at just to pick</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.390" end="00:39:03.099" style="s2">things up for our audiences presencing</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.950" end="00:39:07.059" style="s2">also this therapeutic aspect and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.099" end="00:39:10.829" style="s2">conditions which enable in fact trauma</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.059" end="00:39:13.299" style="s2">to be moved through and positively</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.829" end="00:39:14.950" style="s2">developed or growth to occur from this</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.299" end="00:39:17.979" style="s2">state there&#39;s a sense in which we want</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.950" end="00:39:21.309" style="s2">to avoid that which we want to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.979" end="00:39:23.829" style="s2">presencing that which locks us and</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.309" end="00:39:25.839" style="s2">freezes us and stops us from being able</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.829" end="00:39:29.739" style="s2">to be in a productive relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.839" end="00:39:33.309" style="s2">it and so yes there&#39;s a deep importance</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.739" end="00:39:36.749" style="s2">to the tenderly establishing this domain</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.309" end="00:39:38.739" style="s2">of shared care and where I was moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.749" end="00:39:42.779" style="s2">potentially in the his where I can pose</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.739" end="00:39:47.049" style="s2">a question is so we we see Oriya is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.779" end="00:39:49.779" style="s2">aiding us to presence the the being and</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.049" end="00:39:51.519" style="s2">the depths of our ontology creating a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.779" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">landscape of care in which that can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.519" end="00:39:58.630" style="s2">done and then also also now we might</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:40:00.759" style="s2">consider how we move back into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.630" end="00:40:04.569" style="s2">theory and I wonder how you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.759" end="00:40:07.299" style="s2">characterize that tone so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.569" end="00:40:09.549" style="s2">excellent and and that&#39;s that I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.299" end="00:40:10.719" style="s2">the thing of it is again we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.549" end="00:40:14.019" style="s2">germ of it because we&#39;ve been doing it</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.719" end="00:40:15.549" style="s2">and we keep cycling here and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.019" end="00:40:17.229" style="s2">a matter of creating something to know</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.549" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">who it&#39;s a matter of trying to vary</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.229" end="00:40:23.219" style="s2">through participant observation trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">to sort of delicately extricate into</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.219" end="00:40:28.719" style="s2">sort of stable theory theoretical terms</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.380" end="00:40:32.910" style="s2">and formulation what is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.719" end="00:40:32.910" style="s2">that&#39;s going on here and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.239" end="00:40:42.619" style="s2">there there seems to be some aspects</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.459" end="00:40:44.690" style="s2">here the turn back to theory is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.619" end="00:40:46.579" style="s2">uh the kind of thing I see going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.690" end="00:40:48.079" style="s2">again in the Platonic dialogue in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.579" end="00:40:49.789" style="s2">you are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.079" end="00:40:51.469" style="s2">there&#39;s never there&#39;s that there&#39;s never</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:56.329" style="s2">with questioning because you&#39;re always</p>

<p begin="00:41:09.349" end="00:41:17.089" style="s2">argumentative conclusion so well well</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.229" end="00:41:21.289" style="s2">there should be Theory the theory going</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.089" end="00:41:22.549" style="s2">on and theorizing I don&#39;t it III I sound</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.289" end="00:41:25.160" style="s2">like I&#39;m splitting hairs but I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.549" end="00:41:26.420" style="s2">to be very very careful here well there</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.160" end="00:41:27.979" style="s2">should be theorizing going on I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.420" end="00:41:30.200" style="s2">think there should be Theory building</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.979" end="00:41:32.630" style="s2">going on which is it which is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.200" end="00:41:34.549" style="s2">different thing right so one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.630" end="00:41:36.529" style="s2">mean again again I&#39;m asking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.549" end="00:41:37.910" style="s2">everybody&#39;s patience I&#39;m trying to this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.529" end="00:41:39.559" style="s2">is very much work in progress</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.910" end="00:41:41.599" style="s2">but you know what thira we keep</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.559" end="00:41:43.880" style="s2">theorizing we step back and we do the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.599" end="00:41:45.529" style="s2">theory we weary presence ourself we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.880" end="00:41:47.539" style="s2">restructure the salience the landscape</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.529" end="00:41:49.400" style="s2">we reinvestigate we sensitize we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.539" end="00:41:52.279" style="s2">doing all that stuff right and then but</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.400" end="00:41:54.859" style="s2">then we also do this we we bring we and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.279" end="00:41:56.180" style="s2">this is where guys invoke implication of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.859" end="00:41:59.690" style="s2">this phrase I think is so pregnant we</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.180" end="00:42:02.059" style="s2">come to terms we come to terms about</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:04.099" style="s2">what&#39;s happening there we we try to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.059" end="00:42:06.559" style="s2">almost like poesis we try to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.099" end="00:42:08.869" style="s2">terms and then and then and then we and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.559" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">then we question each other we challenge</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.869" end="00:42:14.089" style="s2">each other we we link things together</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:16.519" style="s2">but the inference is always open to</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.089" end="00:42:19.640" style="s2">being impregnated and redirected by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.519" end="00:42:22.759" style="s2">insight and the insight is always open</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.640" end="00:42:25.039" style="s2">to being challenged and right and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.759" end="00:42:26.509" style="s2">structured again by the inference and</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.039" end="00:42:28.099" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get it&#39;s very much like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.509" end="00:42:29.959" style="s2">when I go there stuff I talk about you</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.099" end="00:42:32.089" style="s2">know and how in rationality we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.959" end="00:42:34.309" style="s2">to balance insight and inference and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.089" end="00:42:36.410" style="s2">internalization off against each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.309" end="00:42:38.619" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.410" end="00:42:41.180" style="s2">come into these practices in any depth</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.619" end="00:42:43.039" style="s2">if you are if you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.180" end="00:42:45.049" style="s2">started down a sappy antral pathway</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.039" end="00:42:46.430" style="s2">where you&#39;ve got some ecologies you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.049" end="00:42:47.690" style="s2">got some individual practices for</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.430" end="00:42:49.520" style="s2">insight and inference and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.690" end="00:42:51.890" style="s2">zatia and you&#39;ve got some a basic</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.520" end="00:42:53.990" style="s2">ecology for for for networking them</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.890" end="00:42:55.550" style="s2">together because I I think that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.990" end="00:42:58.130" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do in theorizing so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.550" end="00:43:00.530" style="s2">see rising is yeah yeah I&#39;m bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.130" end="00:43:02.210" style="s2">elements of theory in that there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.530" end="00:43:04.849" style="s2">inferential moves being made there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.210" end="00:43:07.099" style="s2">insight and those are talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.849" end="00:43:09.410" style="s2">other but I don&#39;t get into monologue</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.099" end="00:43:11.240" style="s2">right the internalization is always</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.410" end="00:43:13.369" style="s2">present you are always there you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.240" end="00:43:14.390" style="s2">always impregnating and I&#39;m using all</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.369" end="00:43:16.790" style="s2">these metaphors because those are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.390" end="00:43:17.900" style="s2">metaphors Socrates is using right and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.790" end="00:43:19.819" style="s2">still think about the how the word</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.900" end="00:43:23.690" style="s2">concept originally goes back to concede</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.819" end="00:43:26.510" style="s2">right and being the Midwife so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.690" end="00:43:28.190" style="s2">that but we&#39;re not trying to - to -</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.510" end="00:43:29.810" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to stay with Plato and not</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.190" end="00:43:31.970" style="s2">get into Aristotle not because Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.810" end="00:43:33.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have value but an Aristotle I</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.970" end="00:43:35.510" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s due to aerosol I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.650" end="00:43:36.740" style="s2">it&#39;s due to an accident of history but</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.510" end="00:43:39.230" style="s2">an Aristotle all we have is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.740" end="00:43:42.020" style="s2">monologic treatise and we want to stay</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.230" end="00:43:43.910" style="s2">in the Platonic dialogue elsewhere when</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.020" end="00:43:45.650" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the science then we do the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.910" end="00:43:48.079" style="s2">Aristotelian thing then we do the theory</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.650" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">building we should theorize there should</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.079" end="00:43:51.349" style="s2">be inference and insight and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:53.210" style="s2">internalization but we shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.349" end="00:43:55.430" style="s2">theory building we should generate lots</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.210" end="00:43:58.220" style="s2">of things that we can then look back on</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.430" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">and say right Oh from from within that</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.220" end="00:44:02.359" style="s2">participant observation there&#39;s all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:04.250" style="s2">these things I could take them out and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.359" end="00:44:05.900" style="s2">do some theory building or I can bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.250" end="00:44:07.760" style="s2">some theory over here and carve your</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.900" end="00:44:09.710" style="s2">science to bear on this and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.760" end="00:44:12.609" style="s2">think there&#39;s kind of a meta dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.710" end="00:44:15.020" style="s2">between what&#39;s going on in via logos and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.609" end="00:44:17.150" style="s2">the scientific study of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.020" end="00:44:18.980" style="s2">cognition and collective intelligence so</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.150" end="00:44:19.940" style="s2">I don&#39;t know that&#39;s adequate but I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.980" end="00:44:22.579" style="s2">it&#39;s a good beginning</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.940" end="00:44:25.130" style="s2">you know what the turn back to theory is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.579" end="00:44:27.800" style="s2">is that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.130" end="00:44:32.150" style="s2">and fine to say but keep it distinct</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.800" end="00:44:34.670" style="s2">from the the the desire to drop into</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.150" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">monologic theory building that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.670" end="00:44:39.410" style="s2">one of the things I would recommend yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:45.380" style="s2">I hear that I hear that ok so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.410" end="00:44:47.900" style="s2">something that may open this out in an</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.380" end="00:44:50.869" style="s2">interesting way or maybe bring it to a</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.900" end="00:44:53.720" style="s2">more fine point so something that has</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.869" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">been a key interest of mine for some</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.720" end="00:45:01.210" style="s2">years has been</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:05.510" style="s2">the the you know a recurse you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.210" end="00:45:12.230" style="s2">seeking sort of a recursive elegance to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.510" end="00:45:19.180" style="s2">how I express modes of orientation in</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.230" end="00:45:19.180" style="s2">particular states of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.420" end="00:45:23.600" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m present seeing this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.560" end="00:45:27.890" style="s2">because also as well I believe what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.600" end="00:45:30.110" style="s2">looking to do when I&#39;m using some terms</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.890" end="00:45:32.740" style="s2">to refer to these modes of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.110" end="00:45:36.410" style="s2">in consciousness which may look very</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.740" end="00:45:39.530" style="s2">much like particular meditative or</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.410" end="00:45:42.800" style="s2">contemplative turns within your own</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.530" end="00:45:46.030" style="s2">experience right the mindfulness for</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.800" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">passenger and the contemplation they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:51.950" style="s2">sort of grasping out again of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">of paying attention to something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.950" end="00:46:03.740" style="s2">just the well as like it is like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:46:06.680" style="s2">internal quietening the paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.740" end="00:46:09.620" style="s2">to what sort of flowing through and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.680" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">there&#39;s also it&#39;s moving again towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.620" end="00:46:13.970" style="s2">me it&#39;s slightly more on the side of but</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.650" end="00:46:15.740" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly more in touch with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.970" end="00:46:19.180" style="s2">world in a little way at attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.740" end="00:46:27.650" style="s2">feel into a deeper connection with it</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.180" end="00:46:30.860" style="s2">and and I&#39;m I mean to speak from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.650" end="00:46:33.200" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s process philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.860" end="00:46:35.330" style="s2">so I&#39;m not looking to stress be from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.200" end="00:46:39.100" style="s2">perspective where we are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.330" end="00:46:41.990" style="s2">identifying the fix to substances</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.100" end="00:46:44.870" style="s2">bashing into each other and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.990" end="00:46:47.330" style="s2">not because ultimately what what I would</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.870" end="00:46:50.120" style="s2">like to move towards as well as invoking</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.330" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">a discussion of sacredness and a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.120" end="00:46:54.350" style="s2">in here to because there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">which sacredness as you articulated in</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.350" end="00:46:59.990" style="s2">the series must be seen through a lens</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:02.990" style="s2">of well of course it&#39;s forever</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.990" end="00:47:05.840" style="s2">incomplete yet at the same time enabling</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.990" end="00:47:08.270" style="s2">of experiences of deep connection and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.840" end="00:47:09.320" style="s2">unity so it&#39;s the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.270" end="00:47:11.780" style="s2">that never ends it</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.320" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">continued transformation and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.780" end="00:47:18.250" style="s2">very much accordant with how it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:21.980" style="s2">very well with me it&#39;s in my own</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.250" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">theorizing it&#39;s a deep constitutive part</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.980" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">of that yet I also feel I&#39;m I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:37.880" style="s2">for and have been looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:40.700" style="s2">reliable ways to refer to what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.880" end="00:47:43.849" style="s2">experienced in cycles of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.700" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">which are something like waypoints which</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.849" end="00:47:50.359" style="s2">could be mistaken for a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:52.099" style="s2">fixation but they&#39;re not a fixation on</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.359" end="00:47:54.650" style="s2">the substance side of things it&#39;s not a</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.650" end="00:47:58.490" style="s2">is and the process is complete when we</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.490" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">about teleology and I realized that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.369" end="00:48:05.869" style="s2">way I was using teleology was in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">continual self making sense which is not</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.869" end="00:48:10.550" style="s2">semantically how you how we how you were</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:11.960" style="s2">using that word and I may not be</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.550" end="00:48:13.970" style="s2">entitled to use the word teleology</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.960" end="00:48:16.970" style="s2">precisely because I&#39;m endorsing a</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">continued self making right but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.970" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">endorsing and continued self making in</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.530" end="00:48:41.619" style="s2">further transformation it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.990" end="00:48:44.839" style="s2">like some houses do end fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.619" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">and what we are in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.839" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">opening and closing as appropriate to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:51.859" style="s2">continue transformation and I prefer to</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.859" end="00:48:58.359" style="s2">people as loving transformation and this</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.270" end="00:49:02.150" style="s2">seems appropriate to me and its</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.359" end="00:49:04.819" style="s2">relevance realization may in fact just</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.150" end="00:49:07.550" style="s2">be that or it might be a key like a very</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.819" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">a deep piece of it and then in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.550" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">slightly more and I guess we have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:17.540" style="s2">loving transformation or something like</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:19.460" style="s2">a self making Tilos in perpetuity but it</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.540" end="00:49:21.710" style="s2">also in these notions of Agape in there</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.460" end="00:49:22.619" style="s2">and an agog a so it&#39;s a loving position</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.710" end="00:49:24.569" style="s2">because consider</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.619" end="00:49:26.700" style="s2">goal element of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.569" end="00:49:28.920" style="s2">which which it needs it&#39;s coming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.700" end="00:49:30.690" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a given Asst that it take</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.920" end="00:49:31.680" style="s2">like it takes finds itself interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.690" end="00:49:35.249" style="s2">for itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.680" end="00:49:36.869" style="s2">I say you&#39;re loving for itself it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.249" end="00:49:38.940" style="s2">just the interest isn&#39;t enough isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.869" end="00:49:41.039" style="s2">enough for me it&#39;s not enough I think it</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.940" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">needs a love okay and in this deep</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.039" end="00:49:44.309" style="s2">interconnected way and what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:46.529" style="s2">it when we&#39;re caring for each other it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.309" end="00:49:50.579" style="s2">the agape as you as you express it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.529" end="00:49:52.200" style="s2">this love and so yes that&#39;s quite a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.579" end="00:49:54.359" style="s2">of thoughts I know I&#39;ve jumped a fair</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.200" end="00:49:56.309" style="s2">way ahead here but it may be why it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.359" end="00:49:58.769" style="s2">wonderful though yeah it was real I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.309" end="00:50:03.779" style="s2">really I found out wonderful yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.769" end="00:50:11.849" style="s2">found out wonderful yet there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.779" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">there yeah it&#39;s so so yeah the way you</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.849" end="00:50:16.200" style="s2">woke that together it&#39;s I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.529" style="s2">interrupt because it was flowing so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.200" end="00:50:23.789" style="s2">smoothly let me try and see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.529" end="00:50:24.839" style="s2">riff on some of the points that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.789" end="00:50:30.359" style="s2">spring to mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.839" end="00:50:32.670" style="s2">as I review the course of that um so</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.359" end="00:50:34.589" style="s2">this lets let&#39;s start with the love and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.670" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">if this brings us back to that notion I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.589" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">had and you invoked an agape as well as</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">a drop-by</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:42.779" style="s2">so I think it&#39;s appropriate the dis</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:45.140" style="s2">notion of mutually reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.779" end="00:50:48.119" style="s2">mutually accelerating disclosure right</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.140" end="00:50:49.410" style="s2">and the idea that you know if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.119" end="00:50:51.720" style="s2">understand vulnerability as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.410" end="00:50:54.239" style="s2">sensitivity a sensitivity to allowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.720" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">not just my mind but my identity to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.239" end="00:50:58.200" style="s2">restructured not just in a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:00.230" style="s2">insight but in an existential insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.200" end="00:51:01.980" style="s2">that will call forth that will adduce</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.230" end="00:51:03.989" style="s2">right and maybe there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.980" end="00:51:05.849" style="s2">vulnerability to the world that will</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.989" end="00:51:07.980" style="s2">call for us or reduce from the world it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.849" end="00:51:10.140" style="s2">will disclose itself in ways it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.980" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">disclose itself to me before there was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.140" end="00:51:15.089" style="s2">way in which I was imposing on the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:18.690" style="s2">and now and it would kind of wilt the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.089" end="00:51:21.089" style="s2">power a romantic sense and now if I if I</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.690" end="00:51:23.519" style="s2">do that restructuring of my identity</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.089" end="00:51:25.410" style="s2">that that allows the world to disclose</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.519" end="00:51:27.390" style="s2">itself in a way this is Wright&#39;s notion</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.410" end="00:51:31.259" style="s2">of the senseability transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.390" end="00:51:33.480" style="s2">that that and that we experience this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.259" end="00:51:35.430" style="s2">Aaron&#39;s work we experience mutually</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.480" end="00:51:36.570" style="s2">accelerating disclosure as love that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.430" end="00:51:38.180" style="s2">how you fall in love with</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.570" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">somebody or something or someplace</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.180" end="00:51:43.110" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:45.000" style="s2">that deep that that&#39;s the knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.110" end="00:51:47.700" style="s2">yourself and then knowing of whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.000" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">is you&#39;re right you&#39;re coupled to are so</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.700" end="00:51:53.550" style="s2">into band together that you&#39;re the the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:54.810" style="s2">the the inherent self loving which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.550" end="00:51:56.550" style="s2">the same thing as selfishness of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.810" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">relevance realization is bound up with</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.550" end="00:52:00.180" style="s2">the relevance realization that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">occurring you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.180" end="00:52:04.280" style="s2">directed towards the world I think all</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:06.210" style="s2">of that the way you put that together</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.280" end="00:52:10.020" style="s2">yes I understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.210" end="00:52:12.540" style="s2">also the thinness of the word interest I</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.020" end="00:52:13.950" style="s2">tried to use that word and I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.540" end="00:52:15.240" style="s2">work with John Logan on this trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.950" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">go back to the original meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.240" end="00:52:20.190" style="s2">word interesa to be within something to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:23.730" style="s2">be within something and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.190" end="00:52:25.140" style="s2">revalorisé like many of our terms we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.730" end="00:52:26.790" style="s2">trivialized that we&#39;ve thinned it out</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.140" end="00:52:28.890" style="s2">dude we just must be a simple</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.790" end="00:52:31.620" style="s2">referential label and not not something</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.890" end="00:52:33.600" style="s2">that sort of more poetically discloses</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.620" end="00:52:37.260" style="s2">the depths of something but to be within</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.600" end="00:52:38.490" style="s2">interesa that right yeah like so I was I</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.260" end="00:52:40.920" style="s2">was trying to play on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.490" end="00:52:44.610" style="s2">relevance realization is constituted by</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.920" end="00:52:46.860" style="s2">its consists within this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.610" end="00:52:49.290" style="s2">relationship to itself if it if it if</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.860" end="00:52:51.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not self monitoring and self caring</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.290" end="00:52:53.160" style="s2">and self coping and self making and self</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.090" end="00:52:55.320" style="s2">organizing it&#39;s not profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.160" end="00:52:57.210" style="s2">autopoietic in that way it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.320" end="00:53:00.300" style="s2">to be functioning as relevance</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.210" end="00:53:02.040" style="s2">realization so I understand what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.300" end="00:53:04.380" style="s2">trying to convey with love what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.040" end="00:53:07.230" style="s2">saying is I it was my intent with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.380" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">word interest sure that etymological</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.230" end="00:53:17.340" style="s2">explorations that deeper meaning and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:18.990" style="s2">therefore give people a term so let me</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.340" end="00:53:21.000" style="s2">be careful here give people that term</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.990" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">other than love for trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.000" end="00:53:24.120" style="s2">something that grounds what we normally</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">call love</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.120" end="00:53:27.840" style="s2">but now you&#39;ve you&#39;ve taken it in</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:29.220" style="s2">another way you&#39;ve said no I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.840" end="00:53:31.590" style="s2">take the word love and I want to deepen</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.220" end="00:53:32.940" style="s2">it down to reach this transformative</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.590" end="00:53:34.260" style="s2">death I think those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.940" end="00:53:37.380" style="s2">actually converging I think those two</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.260" end="00:53:40.650" style="s2">points are actually deeply convergent</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.380" end="00:53:43.830" style="s2">and then that brings me into the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.650" end="00:53:45.510" style="s2">thing that and here&#39;s in theorizing we</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.830" end="00:53:47.880" style="s2">want to talk about it we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.510" end="00:53:50.040" style="s2">conceptual analysis on it but in theory</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.880" end="00:53:51.660" style="s2">oh we&#39;re trying to invoke it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.040" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">you saying we&#39;re trying to presents it</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.660" end="00:53:55.980" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to give it a like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">trying to give it a functional role</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.980" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">right a place in a deep sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:03.930" style="s2">word within the the dialog and man as</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:05.790" style="s2">the sacred ever that well at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.930" end="00:54:07.950" style="s2">sacredness is that ever-present in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.790" end="00:54:10.290" style="s2">Platonic dialogues as well it constantly</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.950" end="00:54:12.410" style="s2">in its invoke like in you know Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.290" end="00:54:15.630" style="s2">even ends the Phaedrus by with a prayer</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.410" end="00:54:17.250" style="s2">for to the god Pan and and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.630" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">other gods were present throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.250" end="00:54:22.050" style="s2">dialogue right so I think talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:23.820" style="s2">while trying to also simultaneously</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.980" end="00:56:57.080" style="s2">the word the sacred or sacred typically</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.220" end="00:56:59.360" style="s2">the sacred to try to refer to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.080" end="00:57:01.400" style="s2">proposal we have as to what the</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.080" end="00:57:09.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s always filled with</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.340" end="00:57:32.450" style="s2">reality discloses itself to us and so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.220" end="00:57:34.490" style="s2">think that&#39;s a new way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.450" end="00:57:36.350" style="s2">recapture so I&#39;m trying to be very</p>

<p begin="00:57:36.350" end="00:57:39.020" style="s2">some new language to something that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.580" end="00:57:41.570" style="s2">think nevertheless has an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.020" end="00:57:42.860" style="s2">heritage and legacy I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.570" end="00:57:45.080" style="s2">mystical traditions and the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.860" end="00:57:47.330" style="s2">traditions speak about sacredness this</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.080" end="00:57:48.890" style="s2">way because it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind as a sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.330" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">of sacredness that is deeply connected</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.890" end="00:57:53.870" style="s2">to the cultivation of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:59.740" style="s2">and wisdom and I offer this as an</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.870" end="00:58:02.420" style="s2">alternative to another prevalent and a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.740" end="00:58:04.370" style="s2">long-standing notion of sacredness as</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.420" end="00:58:06.590" style="s2">perfection where perfectionist</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.370" end="00:58:08.420" style="s2">understood as coming to rest coming to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.590" end="00:58:10.130" style="s2">completion and that was what I always</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.420" end="00:58:13.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve always objected to the word Telos</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.130" end="00:58:15.530" style="s2">because perfection and completion are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.340" end="00:58:17.690" style="s2">bound well etymologically to the word</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.530" end="00:58:22.970" style="s2">Telos and so that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.690" end="00:58:25.550" style="s2">that sense of a TV ology is it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.970" end="00:58:27.170" style="s2">the aspect of that I was resisting and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.550" end="00:58:31.100" style="s2">challenging because I think the notion</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.170" end="00:58:33.230" style="s2">of that what I&#39;m experiment and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.100" end="00:58:34.970" style="s2">where I&#39;m not only criticizing sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.230" end="00:58:38.060" style="s2">standard classical theism there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.970" end="00:58:39.950" style="s2">which I&#39;m criticizing Plato here because</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.060" end="00:58:42.020" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely places where he gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.950" end="00:58:44.510" style="s2">into talking about this in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.020" end="00:58:48.140" style="s2">perfection and I think there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.510" end="00:58:50.690" style="s2">mistake here it&#39;s unclear what he means</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.140" end="00:58:53.240" style="s2">by that but it&#39;s fair that people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.690" end="00:58:56.180" style="s2">come away from that and saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.240" end="00:58:58.850" style="s2">sacred is something that is perfect that</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.180" end="00:59:00.230" style="s2">generates the experience of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.850" end="00:59:02.540" style="s2">Descartes certainly does this in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.230" end="00:59:04.910" style="s2">meditations right and that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.540" end="00:59:07.610" style="s2">is all about and I think I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.910" end="00:59:11.030" style="s2">just a profound mistake I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.610" end="00:59:13.250" style="s2">just a profound mistake so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.030" end="00:59:15.860" style="s2">one of the things that dialogo reveals</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.250" end="00:59:18.290" style="s2">and here think about the logos now as as</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.180" end="00:59:24.890" style="s2">it&#39;s taking on a life of its own and</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:28.190" style="s2">then birthing us and giving us life from</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.890" end="00:59:30.590" style="s2">itself right I think the sacredness in</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.190" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">diello those needs to be the sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.590" end="00:59:37.640" style="s2">not of perfection but the sacredness of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:42.250" style="s2">the inexhaustible hmm yeah I hear that</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.640" end="00:59:45.880" style="s2">John that&#39;s beautiful I agree I agree</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.250" end="00:59:45.880" style="s2">you know I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.930" end="00:59:58.790" style="s2">mmm so so what is so there&#39;s so we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.580" end="01:00:02.150" style="s2">not we are not we are not perfecting the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.790" end="01:00:06.680" style="s2">sacred but we are continually optimizing</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.150" end="01:00:08.320" style="s2">our capacity to make sacred yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.680" end="01:00:10.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where the analogy to</p>

<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:20.570" style="s2">we put dialogue in story but so I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.590" end="01:01:22.310" style="s2">narrative is psychologically</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.570" end="01:01:24.410" style="s2">indispensable for us developmentally I</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.310" end="01:01:26.810" style="s2">think if we don&#39;t cultivate narrative we</p>

<p begin="01:01:26.810" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">non-logical identity it teaches me what</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.360" end="01:01:33.110" style="s2">it means to say I&#39;m identical to that</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:35.120" style="s2">four year old and I&#39;ll be identical to</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.120" end="01:01:40.790" style="s2">so narrative gives me deep practice in a</p>

<p begin="01:01:40.790" end="01:01:45.320" style="s2">logical identity and that is so</p>

<p begin="01:01:45.320" end="01:01:49.100" style="s2">cognition of my metacognition</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.000" end="01:01:51.140" style="s2">I think narrative is indispensable but I</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.100" end="01:01:53.360" style="s2">don&#39;t think narrative is final or</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.140" end="01:01:54.830" style="s2">complete a lot of the traditions and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.360" end="01:01:56.110" style="s2">there&#39;s some psychological work say that</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.830" end="01:01:59.330" style="s2">people can move to sort of a post</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.110" end="01:02:01.250" style="s2">narrative state in which they operate I</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.330" end="01:02:04.100" style="s2">think you can see various friends of</p>

<p begin="01:10:27.720" end="01:10:31.290" style="s2">to add into this Ike and then I&#39;m would</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.540" end="01:10:58.740" style="s2">follow the line of thinking of a Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.060" end="01:11:00.450" style="s2">Hall an awful lot with respect to</p>

<p begin="01:11:03.330" end="01:11:07.350" style="s2">there and then there there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.770" end="01:11:11.790" style="s2">piece they introduced but let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.350" end="01:11:13.260" style="s2">how that sort of sits ya know that so</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.790" end="01:11:15.870" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of points of residence that</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.260" end="01:11:18.810" style="s2">are coming up for me so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.870" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">a you were talking about sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.810" end="01:11:30.720" style="s2">deep connection between temporality and</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:32.310" style="s2">how ontology can put a call upon us so</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.720" end="01:11:33.720" style="s2">and you see this you see this in higher</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.310" end="01:11:35.370" style="s2">states of consciousness when people</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.720" end="01:11:36.810" style="s2">experience the really real they</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.370" end="01:11:38.460" style="s2">experience what I call on to normativity</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.810" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">they feel because</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.460" end="01:11:42.720" style="s2">because meaning is about being connected</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:44.220" style="s2">they want to be deeply connected so they</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.720" end="01:11:46.530" style="s2">want an increasingly more intimate</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.220" end="01:11:48.150" style="s2">conformity with this really real and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.530" end="01:11:50.610" style="s2">they will transform their lives and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.150" end="01:11:52.740" style="s2">their identity so it deeply empowers the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.610" end="01:11:55.530" style="s2">aspiration to transformation then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.740" end="01:11:56.940" style="s2">talking about I so and that again I</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.530" end="01:11:58.170" style="s2">think that&#39;s very much a platonic model</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.940" end="01:12:00.120" style="s2">and then you were looking something that</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.170" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">of course Plato sees is bound up with</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.120" end="01:12:06.150" style="s2">that well how this is we are bringing</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:07.560" style="s2">Plato and Berks on together that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.150" end="01:12:09.180" style="s2">district bees are very interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.560" end="01:12:10.890" style="s2">odd thing to touch to pose them that way</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.180" end="01:12:14.900" style="s2">but Plato of course talks a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.890" end="01:12:19.710" style="s2">about beauty and that it has a capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.900" end="01:12:21.900" style="s2">to to inspire us to aspirations Ascari</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.710" end="01:12:23.640" style="s2">talks about this in her book about how</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.900" end="01:12:25.860" style="s2">beauty prepares us for truth and justice</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.640" end="01:12:27.480" style="s2">because of the way it transforms our</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.860" end="01:12:29.580" style="s2">sensibility and transforms our</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.480" end="01:12:31.950" style="s2">motivation so that we become more and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.580" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">more capable of seeing the truth we</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.950" end="01:12:36.930" style="s2">become more more capable of acting</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:40.650" style="s2">justly and so well there while beauty</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.930" end="01:12:43.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t truth it is a deep affordance of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.650" end="01:12:46.110" style="s2">aspirational path to becoming more</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.530" end="01:12:48.930" style="s2">truthful and to becoming more just and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.110" end="01:12:52.650" style="s2">think all of that I mean and I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.930" end="01:12:55.530" style="s2">Iris Murdoch saw that that was clearly</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.650" end="01:12:57.330" style="s2">what was in the center of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.530" end="01:12:59.490" style="s2">Platonic and the neo platonic tradition</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.330" end="01:13:01.410" style="s2">so I think all of that is very</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.490" end="01:13:05.460" style="s2">interesting it resonates with everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.410" end="01:13:06.870" style="s2">you just said and then let&#39;s bring it</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.460" end="01:13:09.240" style="s2">back to the thing that started it which</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.870" end="01:13:11.640" style="s2">was the the difference experiences of</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.240" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">temporality because we&#39;re talking again</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.640" end="01:13:14.430" style="s2">about what we&#39;re talking about this Anna</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:16.860" style="s2">Garden process we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.430" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">process that the way Beauty couples me</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.860" end="01:13:22.860" style="s2">in such a way that my identity is</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:24.420" style="s2">restructured my my sensibility my</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.860" end="01:13:25.980" style="s2">salience landscape is restructured so</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.420" end="01:13:27.510" style="s2">the way the world can disclose itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.980" end="01:13:29.280" style="s2">because beauty and love are bound</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.510" end="01:13:31.380" style="s2">intricately up together you get that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.280" end="01:13:33.660" style="s2">usually accelerating disclosure and</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.380" end="01:13:37.410" style="s2">beauty is often a call to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.660" end="01:13:40.610" style="s2">often right if it&#39;s right it has that</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.410" end="01:13:44.460" style="s2">kind of call upon us it draws us forth</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.610" end="01:13:45.630" style="s2">but then there is this and then you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.460" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">and of course this is a high to gary</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.630" end="01:13:50.820" style="s2">notion to I suppose but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:52.230" style="s2">the sense in which we&#39;re moving and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.820" end="01:13:54.510" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.230" end="01:13:56.040" style="s2">with JP JP Lamar so I&#39;ve had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.510" end="01:13:57.450" style="s2">really excellent conversations with him</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.040" end="01:14:00.570" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have one very shortly with him</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.450" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">and with Mary Cohen so I&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.570" end="01:14:08.850" style="s2">forward to that a lot but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:10.440" style="s2">sense in which I think about white head</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.850" end="01:14:13.620" style="s2">because in white head white weighted of</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.440" end="01:14:15.960" style="s2">course is deeply a platonic he clearly</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.620" end="01:14:18.060" style="s2">indicates that but he&#39;s also very deeply</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.960" end="01:14:20.010" style="s2">consonant with a lot of Brooks song so</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.060" end="01:14:22.080" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s somebody we could use to to</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.010" end="01:14:26.280" style="s2">talk about this bridge between them but</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.080" end="01:14:30.810" style="s2">what I see what I see in Whitehead as I</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.280" end="01:14:32.940" style="s2">see this bipolar ontology let me try and</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.810" end="01:14:34.530" style="s2">articulate this a little you definitely</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.940" end="01:14:36.030" style="s2">you know he says that you know there</p>

<p begin="01:15:49.290" end="01:15:52.500" style="s2">interesting because he&#39;s seen as the</p>

<p begin="01:15:56.940" end="01:16:00.750" style="s2">very high status in the court and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.340" end="01:16:02.550" style="s2">he was asked to produce the doctrine in</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.750" end="01:16:04.470" style="s2">and he did the paraphilia on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.550" end="01:16:05.579" style="s2">division of nature and then when this</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.470" end="01:16:07.919" style="s2">came out</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.579" end="01:16:12.199" style="s2">Suri&#39;s world around him because he tried</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.919" end="01:16:15.570" style="s2">to articulate this idea of creation</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.199" end="01:16:17.899" style="s2">right as something that should be</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.570" end="01:16:20.969" style="s2">understood as being the complete</p>

<p begin="01:16:20.969" end="01:16:26.159" style="s2">eternity and emergence within time and</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.089" end="01:16:27.570" style="s2">that instead of thinking them as</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.159" end="01:16:29.129" style="s2">opposite we have to think of them</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.570" end="01:16:31.349" style="s2">so here&#39;s metaphysics he doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.129" end="01:16:34.099" style="s2">use a dialectic as he writes the his</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.349" end="01:16:37.260" style="s2">pair for Seon as as a dialogue but</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.099" end="01:16:41.459" style="s2">dialectic is the ontological structure</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.260" end="01:16:43.229" style="s2">he feel he sees like in reality itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.459" end="01:16:45.749" style="s2">that it&#39;s inherently dialectic precisely</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.229" end="01:16:48.769" style="s2">because of the complete top-to-bottom</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.749" end="01:16:53.489" style="s2">interpenetration of emanation and</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.769" end="01:16:55.829" style="s2">emergence within creation and and so and</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.489" end="01:16:57.629" style="s2">then and then - and then to top it all</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.829" end="01:16:59.639" style="s2">off because of the particular notion of</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.629" end="01:17:00.209" style="s2">God which i think is where the heresy</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.639" end="01:17:05.820" style="s2">comes in</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.209" end="01:17:08.579" style="s2">he sees all of that as one with God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.820" end="01:17:10.979" style="s2">inherent self creativity that when God</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.579" end="01:17:13.649" style="s2">is creating that that is always just an</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.979" end="01:17:16.919" style="s2">act of self creation so it&#39;s that this</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.649" end="01:17:23.459" style="s2">dialectic of the dialectic of creation</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.919" end="01:17:26.899" style="s2">is is is inseparable from God&#39;s ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.459" end="01:17:29.010" style="s2">self creativity and so he see again</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.899" end="01:17:32.099" style="s2">again it&#39;s a different notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.010" end="01:17:34.829" style="s2">sacred as this ongoing inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.099" end="01:17:39.329" style="s2">production of intelligibility as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.829" end="01:17:41.099" style="s2">to the at rest perfection that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.329" end="01:17:44.879" style="s2">imagine he was regarded as heretical</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.099" end="01:17:46.649" style="s2">he&#39;s now sort of come back around and</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.879" end="01:17:48.269" style="s2">people are starting to consider him much</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.649" end="01:17:50.760" style="s2">more carefully even within theological</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.269" end="01:17:54.139" style="s2">circles precisely because this this</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.760" end="01:18:00.449" style="s2">ontology that he talks about seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.139" end="01:18:02.459" style="s2">so apt for talking about these these two</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.449" end="01:18:05.010" style="s2">things that we&#39;re trying to bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.459" end="01:18:07.800" style="s2">together within our worldview and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.010" end="01:18:09.809" style="s2">would add apt for providing a deep</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.800" end="01:18:12.869" style="s2">grounding a deep ontological grounding</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.809" end="01:18:15.310" style="s2">for discursive dialectic like what you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.869" end="01:18:19.200" style="s2">and I are doing right here right now</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.310" end="01:18:25.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s beautiful it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.200" end="01:18:26.980" style="s2">okay so two things come to mind both</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.000" end="01:18:29.740" style="s2">take a long time to say let me see if I</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.980" end="01:18:32.050" style="s2">can reduce both quickly so that</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.740" end="01:18:35.170" style="s2">hopefully we don&#39;t lose either the first</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.050" end="01:18:37.540" style="s2">is that I would continue to like to hone</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.170" end="01:18:41.380" style="s2">in on what I mean by modes of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.540" end="01:18:46.000" style="s2">orientation yes I would and the second</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.380" end="01:18:51.300" style="s2">is just how much I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.000" end="01:18:54.790" style="s2">continued discussion and careful</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.300" end="01:18:58.390" style="s2">experimentation with with the embedding</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.790" end="01:19:02.110" style="s2">and invitation of more people to</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.390" end="01:19:04.720" style="s2">participate in community regarding what</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.110" end="01:19:10.600" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking about in such a fashion</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.720" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">that well that that well does it justice</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.600" end="01:19:18.190" style="s2">cares for it but I&#39;m also interested in</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:20.050" style="s2">the I do feel a sense of urgency and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.190" end="01:19:23.890" style="s2">appreciate the importance of being slow</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.050" end="01:19:26.470" style="s2">and smooth I deeply do and I also feel a</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.890" end="01:19:30.880" style="s2">sense of urgency and I and I feel that</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.470" end="01:19:34.090" style="s2">in our culture we are lacking the pillar</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.880" end="01:19:37.060" style="s2">where a polis can be together and</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.090" end="01:19:39.730" style="s2">mutually inform each other and disclose</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.060" end="01:19:43.150" style="s2">themselves in this fashion so that we</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.730" end="01:19:45.430" style="s2">can become more in touch with the state</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.150" end="01:19:47.860" style="s2">of our collective moment and our</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.430" end="01:19:49.930" style="s2">connection to ecology and how we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.860" end="01:19:53.350" style="s2">actually begin to take powerful</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.930" end="01:19:57.130" style="s2">decisions powerful decisions must mean</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.350" end="01:20:01.900" style="s2">they should be taken from from an</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.130" end="01:20:04.570" style="s2">already exhibited capacity to presence</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.900" end="01:20:07.240" style="s2">oneself in relationship with this very</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.570" end="01:20:09.430" style="s2">process of the generation and</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.240" end="01:20:12.340" style="s2">development of wisdom if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.430" end="01:20:14.770" style="s2">coming from that then it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.340" end="01:20:19.200" style="s2">deeply it&#39;s is actually horrifying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.770" end="01:20:22.240" style="s2">horrifying yes and which is why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.200" end="01:20:25.750" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s that and but it maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.240" end="01:20:28.630" style="s2">could go the modes of orientation route</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.750" end="01:20:29.650" style="s2">first which is easy first of all I like</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.630" end="01:20:34.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.650" end="01:20:38.050" style="s2">I think it&#39;s excellent and I&#39;d like so</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.980" end="01:20:40.269" style="s2">okay I want to turn back things to you</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.050" end="01:20:43.840" style="s2">very momentarily I&#39;ve noticed that at</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.269" end="01:20:46.090" style="s2">crucial points you invoke this as</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.840" end="01:20:49.900" style="s2">something that was paying a pivotal</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.090" end="01:20:56.530" style="s2">meaning capacity to turn things playing</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.900" end="01:20:58.179" style="s2">a pivotal role in one note one moment if</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.530" end="01:21:00.250" style="s2">the OREA by the way it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.179" end="01:21:01.989" style="s2">step back and in a high to garyun</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.250" end="01:21:04.360" style="s2">fashion like I just didn&#39;t like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.989" end="01:21:05.590" style="s2">done to step back and to degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.360" end="01:21:07.869" style="s2">you can and sometimes we make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.590" end="01:21:09.429" style="s2">about this and I&#39;ve made some myself but</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.869" end="01:21:11.079" style="s2">did agree to which we can and so more</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.429" end="01:21:12.760" style="s2">education is needed but did you read to</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.079" end="01:21:16.179" style="s2">we can pay attention to the etymology</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.760" end="01:21:18.789" style="s2">try to give life back to the words so</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.179" end="01:21:22.510" style="s2">that they can resonate in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.789" end="01:21:24.460" style="s2">beyond our normal everyday manipulation</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.510" end="01:21:26.440" style="s2">and control of them give them back some</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.460" end="01:21:30.190" style="s2">of their being so they&#39;re not just words</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.440" end="01:21:31.719" style="s2">that we have so like I said so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.190" end="01:21:33.699" style="s2">and we&#39;re trying to do this right now I</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.719" end="01:21:35.289" style="s2">think with modes of orientation and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.699" end="01:21:37.539" style="s2">was trying to do it when I I was</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.289" end="01:21:39.610" style="s2">invoking this term pivotal that you</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.539" end="01:21:41.889" style="s2">invoke modes of orientation because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.610" end="01:21:43.989" style="s2">a pivot it allows us to move and shift</p>

<p begin="01:21:43.989" end="01:21:49.570" style="s2">to move because we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we found a</p>

<p begin="01:21:51.940" end="01:21:56.769" style="s2">you know the ways in which mode of</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.800" end="01:21:58.480" style="s2">orientation is pivotal I think is what</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.769" end="01:21:59.739" style="s2">what I was picking up on and what I want</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.480" end="01:22:01.269" style="s2">to try and explore with you I just</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.739" end="01:22:04.750" style="s2">wanted to make that note again that</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.269" end="01:22:06.550" style="s2">theory a note about the value of rien</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.750" end="01:22:08.920" style="s2">pregnat in our words as much as possible</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.550" end="01:22:11.559" style="s2">by paying attention to their meta</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.920" end="01:22:13.090" style="s2">ferocity and to their etymology yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.559" end="01:22:15.219" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s beautiful and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.090" end="01:22:17.679" style="s2">something that you evidence to an</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.219" end="01:22:19.090" style="s2">incredible degree in your lectures and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.679" end="01:22:21.639" style="s2">think it&#39;s one of the one of the many</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.090" end="01:22:24.150" style="s2">chief reasons why they afford people to</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.639" end="01:22:25.690" style="s2">open up their conceptions so much and</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.150" end="01:22:31.440" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.690" end="01:22:34.719" style="s2">so so okay so modes of orientation then</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.440" end="01:22:38.650" style="s2">fundamentally I don&#39;t know fundament a</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.719" end="01:22:40.510" style="s2">key piece in the role that these modes</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.650" end="01:22:42.159" style="s2">of orientation are playing is in our</p>

<p begin="01:22:42.159" end="01:22:47.980" style="s2">to death and dissolution and broadly</p>

<p begin="01:22:47.980" end="01:22:53.650" style="s2">experience the horror as well right that</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.650" end="01:22:57.040" style="s2">there dislodging there how is it how can</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.650" end="01:22:59.460" style="s2">we find ourselves again how can we find</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.040" end="01:23:02.199" style="s2">connection again from a place of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.460" end="01:23:04.030" style="s2">disconnection in some respects that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.199" end="01:23:07.270" style="s2">one that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.030" end="01:23:10.679" style="s2">and the other is also how we can front</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.270" end="01:23:13.000" style="s2">up to change how we can from a place of</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.679" end="01:23:15.790" style="s2">sort of coherence that&#39;s become</p>

<p begin="01:23:21.190" end="01:23:33.010" style="s2">that the capacity to attend in different</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.380" end="01:23:35.050" style="s2">modes is is sort of um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.010" end="01:23:38.730" style="s2">hard for me to imagine the pictures with</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.730" end="01:23:47.080" style="s2">fundamental building blocks of just how</p>

<p begin="01:24:08.560" end="01:24:13.780" style="s2">confront the two terms that were pivotal</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.020" end="01:24:15.520" style="s2">for me in making sense of some deep</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.520" end="01:24:19.090" style="s2">confrontation and surrender I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.560" end="01:24:21.580" style="s2">attached to either there is a negative</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.090" end="01:24:23.650" style="s2">and positive mode of each but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.580" end="01:24:25.860" style="s2">just what the terms are maybe I would be</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.650" end="01:24:29.020" style="s2">interested to hear how you would take</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.860" end="01:24:31.449" style="s2">the this kind of discussion and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.020" end="01:24:35.350" style="s2">attached to having to do it through the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.449" end="01:24:38.650" style="s2">lens I&#39;m bringing sure so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.350" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there I like so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.650" end="01:24:43.170" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s gather together logos gather</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:46.120" style="s2">together so the things belong together</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.170" end="01:24:48.940" style="s2">that that you know there&#39;s this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.120" end="01:24:51.699" style="s2">this there&#39;s this encouragement and in</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.940" end="01:24:54.460" style="s2">caring that is bound up with the mode of</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.699" end="01:24:57.070" style="s2">orientation as you said because</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.460" end="01:25:00.160" style="s2">as what we&#39;re facing is we&#39;re facing the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.070" end="01:25:02.920" style="s2">real possibility of dissolution a kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.160" end="01:25:04.719" style="s2">of death and so it&#39;s interesting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.920" end="01:25:06.070" style="s2">a term of course in dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.719" end="01:25:10.570" style="s2">that tries to point to this which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.070" end="01:25:13.739" style="s2">criticality our system is critical when</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.570" end="01:25:16.750" style="s2">it is undergoing enough dissolution that</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.739" end="01:25:19.510" style="s2">it can restructure and reframe itself</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.750" end="01:25:21.640" style="s2">but if it takes too much then it will</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.510" end="01:25:23.410" style="s2">actually fall into this dissolution so</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.640" end="01:25:25.380" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s called critical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.410" end="01:25:28.030" style="s2">it&#39;s playing on both senses of the word</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.380" end="01:25:32.140" style="s2">critical I think in a very nice fashion</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.030" end="01:25:33.700" style="s2">so I think one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.140" end="01:25:37.390" style="s2">critical one of the things that can get</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.700" end="01:25:40.960" style="s2">us into criticality and that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.390" end="01:25:42.130" style="s2">our culture is not good at and this is</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.960" end="01:25:45.489" style="s2">why I&#39;ve spent some time on I keep</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.130" end="01:25:51.370" style="s2">coming back to it is serious play and</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.489" end="01:25:52.840" style="s2">serious play I think is I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.370" end="01:25:55.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that has</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.840" end="01:25:59.670" style="s2">been exacted you see in in mammals not</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.450" end="01:26:03.550" style="s2">just in us right serious play is I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.670" end="01:26:04.870" style="s2">indispensable for qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.550" end="01:26:05.920" style="s2">development the kind of development</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.870" end="01:26:07.480" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about here the</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.920" end="01:26:09.489" style="s2">development that the kind there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.480" end="01:26:11.170" style="s2">development that is quantitative where</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.489" end="01:26:12.760" style="s2">you just acquire more and more knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.170" end="01:26:15.670" style="s2">and more information and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.760" end="01:26:18.219" style="s2">qualitative development which I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.670" end="01:26:20.410" style="s2">you can best understand as development</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.219" end="01:26:22.450" style="s2">that must pass through criticality to</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.410" end="01:26:24.219" style="s2">get to the developmental stage you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.450" end="01:26:26.080" style="s2">just keep sort of more of the same and</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.219" end="01:26:28.000" style="s2">acquire more you actually have that you</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.080" end="01:26:29.770" style="s2">need new functionality and so you have</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.000" end="01:26:31.210" style="s2">to put the current functionality at risk</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.770" end="01:26:34.540" style="s2">it has to go into a period of</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.210" end="01:26:35.830" style="s2">criticality and what we see is and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.540" end="01:26:37.810" style="s2">you know and I think this just is</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.830" end="01:26:39.910" style="s2">convergent with the brilliant work of La</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.810" end="01:26:41.920" style="s2">Paul and the brilliant work of Agnes</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.910" end="01:26:44.290" style="s2">Keller - but we can&#39;t sort of and and</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.920" end="01:26:46.450" style="s2">and voter&#39;s work about you can&#39;t infer a</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.290" end="01:26:48.310" style="s2">stronger logic from a weaker logic you</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.450" end="01:26:50.290" style="s2">can&#39;t infer yourself through these</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.310" end="01:26:54.040" style="s2">transformations you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.290" end="01:26:56.890" style="s2">aspire through them and I tried to argue</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.040" end="01:26:59.350" style="s2">that this is that the notion of serious</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.890" end="01:27:01.719" style="s2">play was part of what was at work in in</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.350" end="01:27:04.360" style="s2">nos in the Gnostics or at least that in</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.719" end="01:27:06.160" style="s2">within nauseous because gnosis is again</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.360" end="01:27:07.929" style="s2">the Greek word for that deep kind of</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.929" end="01:27:13.540" style="s2">knowing and and of course the gnostics</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.840" end="01:27:15.850" style="s2">they sought to place themselves into</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.540" end="01:27:18.250" style="s2">exactly the kind of existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.850" end="01:27:21.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about here the conic</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.250" end="01:27:24.730" style="s2">talks about that how transgressive of</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.640" end="01:27:27.429" style="s2">their so the point about the the serious</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.730" end="01:27:32.830" style="s2">play is it&#39;s it&#39;s how I hate human</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.429" end="01:27:36.550" style="s2">beings it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s how we put</p>

<p begin="01:27:36.550" end="01:27:42.120" style="s2">metastability a state of criticality so</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.460" end="01:27:45.070" style="s2">that qualitative development is actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.120" end="01:27:47.199" style="s2">possible for us while also setting up a</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.070" end="01:27:49.949" style="s2">whole bunch of constraints and systems</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.199" end="01:27:54.070" style="s2">so that we get back out or reverse out</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.949" end="01:28:00.969" style="s2">if needed we don&#39;t over and completely</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.070" end="01:28:03.310" style="s2">commit so that like we there we create a</p>

<p begin="01:28:03.310" end="01:28:08.770" style="s2">we can taste and touch the criticality</p>

<p begin="01:28:51.370" end="01:28:55.860" style="s2">more error tolerance so that I can and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.949" end="01:28:59.380" style="s2">want to use this we&#39;re very very</p>

<p begin="01:29:07.390" end="01:29:12.880" style="s2">course my way through this and i think</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.730" end="01:29:14.980" style="s2">why it&#39;s a problem for us in our</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.880" end="01:29:17.260" style="s2">culture&#39;s we don&#39;t have we we don&#39;t we</p>

<p begin="01:29:17.260" end="01:29:21.790" style="s2">lot to valorize or validate serious play</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.600" end="01:29:25.270" style="s2">play is either trivialized into</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.790" end="01:29:27.910" style="s2">fun for us or we think if it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.270" end="01:29:29.860" style="s2">in serious it must be work and then with</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.910" end="01:29:31.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a step and an algorithm and a</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.860" end="01:29:34.720" style="s2">recipe for getting there which of course</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.420" end="01:29:36.910" style="s2">is not how development works and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.720" end="01:29:40.360" style="s2">place where cultures generally do</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.910" end="01:29:42.010" style="s2">serious play for adults and also perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.360" end="01:29:44.770" style="s2">for children but primarily for adults is</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.010" end="01:29:48.340" style="s2">ritual that&#39;s what ritual is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.770" end="01:29:51.040" style="s2">place where we do serious play I mean if</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.340" end="01:29:54.100" style="s2">you go into church and it&#39;s in and you</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.040" end="01:29:56.020" style="s2">open yourself up mode of orientation to</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.100" end="01:29:58.120" style="s2">the serious play that&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.020" end="01:29:59.350" style="s2">if that&#39;s viable for you I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.120" end="01:30:02.200" style="s2">is what I don&#39;t think would be viable</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.350" end="01:30:03.730" style="s2">for me but if it&#39;s viable for you right</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.200" end="01:30:05.590" style="s2">and you get involved with the serious</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.730" end="01:30:07.360" style="s2">play of the Eucharist or let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.590" end="01:30:09.430" style="s2">Easter the portrayal of the crucifixion</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.360" end="01:30:10.900" style="s2">and the resume like whoo like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.430" end="01:30:12.580" style="s2">playing with your identity and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.900" end="01:30:14.380" style="s2">playing with some of your deepest</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.580" end="01:30:16.060" style="s2">effective machinery and you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.380" end="01:30:19.810" style="s2">allowing you but you&#39;re you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.060" end="01:30:21.940" style="s2">involved with a kind of profound serious</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.810" end="01:30:23.800" style="s2">play that nevertheless there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.940" end="01:30:25.480" style="s2">community around you there&#39;s a tradition</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.800" end="01:30:28.720" style="s2">around you you&#39;ve been taken into a</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.480" end="01:30:30.610" style="s2">space outside of the ongoing profane</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.720" end="01:30:32.800" style="s2">space of the world so you you&#39;re safe</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.610" end="01:30:35.020" style="s2">from the world for a while so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.800" end="01:30:37.210" style="s2">lot more error tolerance there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.020" end="01:30:38.740" style="s2">more support and there&#39;s a ritual that</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.210" end="01:30:41.020" style="s2">other people have tried so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.740" end="01:30:43.630" style="s2">just starting it in an other didactic</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.020" end="01:30:47.260" style="s2">fashion from scratch and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.630" end="01:30:51.460" style="s2">there are there are deep connections</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.260" end="01:30:53.170" style="s2">between the meaning crisis and our</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.460" end="01:30:55.570" style="s2">inability to take up the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.170" end="01:30:57.400" style="s2">modes of modes of orientation precisely</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.570" end="01:31:01.720" style="s2">because our culture is really really</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.400" end="01:31:05.170" style="s2">poor are dealing with serious play like</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.720" end="01:31:07.470" style="s2">and notice how how poorly and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.170" end="01:31:10.990" style="s2">that even economically we reward people</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.470" end="01:31:14.470" style="s2">who who live lives in which serious play</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.990" end="01:31:17.380" style="s2">like musicians and artists and other</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.470" end="01:31:19.780" style="s2">people who have decided that serious</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.380" end="01:31:22.420" style="s2">play is something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.780" end="01:31:25.150" style="s2">exemplified and enacted we tend to say</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.420" end="01:31:27.130" style="s2">but that&#39;s not as important as work you</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.150" end="01:31:29.740" style="s2">know this Protestant work at work we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.130" end="01:31:31.180" style="s2">a card maker or you know all that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.740" end="01:31:35.650" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t work I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.180" end="01:31:36.850" style="s2">that but we I mean again another symptom</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.650" end="01:31:39.310" style="s2">in crisis and this has become a</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.850" end="01:31:41.830" style="s2">pervasive we have a culture and work</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.310" end="01:31:43.300" style="s2">workaholism right we&#39;re call ism what is</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.830" end="01:31:46.780" style="s2">it workaholism is i think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.300" end="01:31:49.630" style="s2">accepted workaholics yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.780" end="01:31:54.370" style="s2">basically people people do not know how</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.630" end="01:31:56.920" style="s2">to be other than work so they do not</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.370" end="01:31:59.949" style="s2">know how to become really because they</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.920" end="01:32:01.750" style="s2">can&#39;t engage in serious play and han</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.949" end="01:32:05.640" style="s2">talks about this in the agony of ecstasy</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.750" end="01:32:08.020" style="s2">they get into a you know a mode of self</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.640" end="01:32:11.080" style="s2">exploitation where they&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.020" end="01:32:13.000" style="s2">driven to achieve to achieve to achieve</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.080" end="01:32:14.710" style="s2">and they can&#39;t engage in actual</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.000" end="01:32:16.420" style="s2">development in serious play so when</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.710" end="01:32:19.390" style="s2">they&#39;re not working all they can do is</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.420" end="01:32:20.409" style="s2">to drop into a kind of two / almost a</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.390" end="01:32:26.400" style="s2">lethargy of</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.409" end="01:32:29.500" style="s2">luxury they like so the idea that that</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.400" end="01:32:32.560" style="s2">something really important goes on all</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.500" end="01:32:36.130" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is basically recovering so</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.560" end="01:32:38.409" style="s2">that you can go back to work and so i</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.130" end="01:32:43.239" style="s2">think that&#39;s also a very important</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.409" end="01:32:45.699" style="s2">social problem that is feeding back into</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.239" end="01:32:49.420" style="s2">the meeting crisis because of the way it</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.699" end="01:32:51.010" style="s2">is foreclosing for us access to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.420" end="01:32:53.440" style="s2">modes of orientation that are most</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.010" end="01:32:56.170" style="s2">appropriate for deep development yeah</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.440" end="01:32:58.270" style="s2">that&#39;s beautiful and it&#39;s remarkable to</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.170" end="01:33:01.390" style="s2">me because you tied the link there</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.270" end="01:33:04.659" style="s2">between modes of orientation and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.390" end="01:33:06.640" style="s2">development of a space within culture</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.659" end="01:33:11.140" style="s2">where people can precisely come together</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.640" end="01:33:13.000" style="s2">and seriously play in the fashion do any</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.140" end="01:33:15.969" style="s2">describe doing it we&#39;re doing it right</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.000" end="01:33:21.520" style="s2">now and this is what I mean about and</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.969" end="01:33:24.070" style="s2">and this is why I often so I vertically</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.520" end="01:33:25.150" style="s2">don&#39;t respond to comments in the videos</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.070" end="01:33:27.219" style="s2">because first of all there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.150" end="01:33:28.719" style="s2">and I couldn&#39;t I can&#39;t and secondly</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.219" end="01:33:30.969" style="s2">people are people are often just</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.719" end="01:33:33.040" style="s2">extemporaneous you know expressing and</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.969" end="01:33:34.420" style="s2">that&#39;s fine I don&#39;t that&#39;s fine do that</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.040" end="01:33:35.800" style="s2">and they often they want to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.420" end="01:33:37.570" style="s2">other people all of that and there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.800" end="01:33:39.449" style="s2">those reasons sometimes if somebody</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.570" end="01:33:42.640" style="s2">catches me on a factual error then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.449" end="01:33:44.710" style="s2">admit it on that way or if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.640" end="01:33:46.780" style="s2">there&#39;s somebody else that I&#39;m like you</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.710" end="01:33:48.460" style="s2">if you commented I&#39;d respond because we</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.780" end="01:33:49.810" style="s2">have an ongoing dialogue and I know that</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.460" end="01:33:51.430" style="s2">I have access to you</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.810" end="01:33:53.620" style="s2">a deep dialogue not the superficial</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.430" end="01:33:55.750" style="s2">format of commenting on YouTube which I</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.620" end="01:33:56.590" style="s2">think could be very irresponsible in in</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.750" end="01:34:01.030" style="s2">so many ways</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.590" end="01:34:02.260" style="s2">so but right I&#39;ve replied a couple times</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.030" end="01:34:03.820" style="s2">when people have commented in my</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.260" end="01:34:06.160" style="s2">dialogues with Jordan Hall and they say</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.820" end="01:34:08.980" style="s2">like this isn&#39;t going anywhere and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.160" end="01:34:12.610" style="s2">trying to it&#39;s like no no stop thinking</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.980" end="01:34:17.080" style="s2">of this as work right what Jordan is</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.610" end="01:34:19.060" style="s2">doing is he is exemplifying a very</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.080" end="01:34:22.300" style="s2">profound kind of serious play he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.060" end="01:34:24.820" style="s2">showing us how to participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.300" end="01:34:27.730" style="s2">what&#39;s serious what serious play in</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.820" end="01:34:30.700" style="s2">dialogue is like because he is trying to</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.730" end="01:34:32.100" style="s2">afford development much more than he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.700" end="01:34:34.960" style="s2">trying to come to a conclusive</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.100" end="01:34:37.420" style="s2">proposition and that&#39;s what needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.960" end="01:34:42.360" style="s2">paid very careful attention to yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.420" end="01:34:45.010" style="s2">beautiful I absolutely agree and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.360" end="01:34:48.820" style="s2">certainly a deep reason why I respect</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.010" end="01:34:51.280" style="s2">Jordan so much for he&#39;s doing and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.820" end="01:34:54.690" style="s2">that I feel a deep resonance actually on</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.280" end="01:34:58.510" style="s2">that point you know generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.690" end="01:35:01.330" style="s2">moving around in the world I&#39;m engaging</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.510" end="01:35:03.400" style="s2">with people much the same as this I</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.330" end="01:35:04.840" style="s2">think usually I with more with a bit</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.400" end="01:35:07.120" style="s2">more lightness not that I haven&#39;t felt</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.840" end="01:35:09.430" style="s2">light in this but there&#39;s also the sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.120" end="01:35:11.470" style="s2">in which that this is recorded and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.430" end="01:35:13.710" style="s2">sort of sitting still I actually like to</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.470" end="01:35:19.630" style="s2">move around quite a lot you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.710" end="01:35:22.420" style="s2">yeah and but but but fundamentally the</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.630" end="01:35:25.840" style="s2">way in to meaningful relationships with</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.420" end="01:35:27.580" style="s2">people is almost always maybe it is</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.840" end="01:35:29.620" style="s2">always I just want to have a bit of</p>

<p begin="01:36:34.090" end="01:36:40.840" style="s2">way for us then and there John I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.469" end="01:36:44.620" style="s2">conscious now that we&#39;re coming to I</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.840" end="01:36:46.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know how long we have left so I</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.620" end="01:36:49.180" style="s2">can go a little bit after six to make up</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.690" end="01:36:50.920" style="s2">for my time a little bit past this</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.180" end="01:36:52.989" style="s2">schedule two hours to make up for that</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.920" end="01:36:57.000" style="s2">gap that we&#39;ve countered so that you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.989" end="01:37:00.969" style="s2">have a more complete thing but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.000" end="01:37:04.060" style="s2">about another sort of 25 minutes I was</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.969" end="01:37:06.280" style="s2">okay beautiful okay excellent okay then</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.060" end="01:37:08.320" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s see how let&#39;s see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.280" end="01:37:10.780" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s an incredible I feel</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.320" end="01:37:13.600" style="s2">so grateful to have this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.780" end="01:37:15.100" style="s2">opportunity and I have worked fairly</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.600" end="01:37:17.320" style="s2">hard to have this kind of opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.100" end="01:37:19.060" style="s2">but there&#39;s a thing in dialog that I</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.320" end="01:37:21.310" style="s2">feel I&#39;m bringing people together to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.060" end="01:37:22.840" style="s2">this kind of thing and contend with deep</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.310" end="01:37:25.060" style="s2">issues and I would love there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.840" end="01:37:26.440" style="s2">beautiful areas of dialogue and places</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.060" end="01:37:28.180" style="s2">we could go but it&#39;s almost feels like</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.440" end="01:37:30.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a special power right now</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.180" end="01:37:33.190" style="s2">because I can drop in I can drop into</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.670" end="01:37:35.050" style="s2">myself and drop a question and I can</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.190" end="01:37:39.190" style="s2">throw it over to you and you&#39;ve sort of</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.050" end="01:37:40.989" style="s2">agree so it&#39;s a hilarious you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.190" end="01:37:42.910" style="s2">like the world can open up to me just</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.989" end="01:37:46.870" style="s2">from doing that and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.910" end="01:37:48.850" style="s2">remarkable so so I&#39;m going to if you</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.870" end="01:37:49.570" style="s2">don&#39;t mind take that opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.850" end="01:37:52.960" style="s2">just that</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.570" end="01:37:55.770" style="s2">and see in what way we can we can</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.960" end="01:37:58.770" style="s2">unleash what you can have to offer</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.770" end="01:37:58.770" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.290" end="01:38:14.090" style="s2">hmm oh this is it</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.780" end="01:38:16.460" style="s2">so hmm okay so there&#39;s a few areas of</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.090" end="01:38:18.290" style="s2">inquiry that have come to mind first of</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.460" end="01:38:22.190" style="s2">all I was really motivated by this</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.290" end="01:38:26.690" style="s2">notion of joy and in what sense in what</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.190" end="01:38:33.050" style="s2">sense we you can create for us hear us</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.690" end="01:38:33.890" style="s2">or speak to how of how of how where may</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.050" end="01:38:38.210" style="s2">be ripe</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.890" end="01:38:41.180" style="s2">you know creation of a an element or</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.210" end="01:38:43.670" style="s2">space within culture that can afford a</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.180" end="01:38:45.710" style="s2">sort of joyful opening of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.670" end="01:38:49.340" style="s2">expression and then you know what came</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.710" end="01:38:51.200" style="s2">to me John I felt that maybe they are</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.340" end="01:38:53.810" style="s2">you know metaphorically they&#39;re the sort</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.200" end="01:38:59.870" style="s2">of opponent processing of that and I</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.810" end="01:39:03.650" style="s2">felt I felt into a a difficulty and a</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.870" end="01:39:06.140" style="s2">certain trauma of our time and and that</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.650" end="01:39:09.380" style="s2">is going to be a bit of a lateral jump</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.140" end="01:39:13.010" style="s2">but it may be somewhat resonant and that</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.380" end="01:39:16.220" style="s2">for me is one experienced I think by</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.010" end="01:39:19.430" style="s2">both men and women by both but in a both</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.220" end="01:39:24.740" style="s2">masculine sense and a feminine sense but</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.430" end="01:39:26.930" style="s2">there is a the the whole world of me too</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.740" end="01:39:29.000" style="s2">and just not what me too is specifically</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.930" end="01:39:31.340" style="s2">but what it&#39;s tapping into in sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.000" end="01:39:34.490" style="s2">certain disconnection and in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.340" end="01:39:36.470" style="s2">and inappropriate kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.490" end="01:39:38.570" style="s2">at an environment fundamentally of not</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.470" end="01:39:41.600" style="s2">caring there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep sense in</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.570" end="01:39:45.890" style="s2">which an interlocking sense of care has</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.600" end="01:39:49.330" style="s2">not been managed for whatever reason for</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.890" end="01:39:51.920" style="s2">the psyches of people involved in this</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.330" end="01:39:55.850" style="s2">millio that we find ourselves in and</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.920" end="01:40:00.020" style="s2">something I&#39;ve experienced is that there</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.850" end="01:40:01.340" style="s2">is a there&#39;s a particular I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.020" end="01:40:05.480" style="s2">and what maybe not a particular but</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.340" end="01:40:07.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep sense of a a woundedness</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.480" end="01:40:08.630" style="s2">for both masculine and feminine but</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.130" end="01:40:10.490" style="s2">let&#39;s maybe if concentrated on the</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.630" end="01:40:11.760" style="s2">feminine perhaps they have to be taken</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.490" end="01:40:13.650" style="s2">together that&#39;s true surely</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.760" end="01:40:15.270" style="s2">poor sense and I think people don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.650" end="01:40:18.480" style="s2">that enough really speak to both</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.270" end="01:40:22.200" style="s2">masculinity and femininity together but</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.480" end="01:40:24.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a block there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.200" end="01:40:27.240" style="s2">somehow an environment of safety that</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.720" end="01:40:29.520" style="s2">must be cultivated so presence a certain</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.240" end="01:40:32.580" style="s2">kind of I would like to say and it has</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.520" end="01:40:36.180" style="s2">to be metaphorical is a distinctly</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.580" end="01:40:38.880" style="s2">feminine kind of energy a feminine kind</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.180" end="01:40:42.150" style="s2">of vulnerability in certain spaces for</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.880" end="01:40:44.250" style="s2">that to be present but not in not to be</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.150" end="01:40:47.040" style="s2">looked for that not to be an exposure</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.250" end="01:40:48.870" style="s2">for that presence seeing not to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.040" end="01:40:52.290" style="s2">then as prey you know what I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.870" end="01:40:54.420" style="s2">like it&#39;s there has and it&#39;s enabling of</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.290" end="01:40:56.820" style="s2">that vulnerability because without that</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.420" end="01:40:59.430" style="s2">and the appropriate relationship there</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.820" end="01:41:02.990" style="s2">in men and women seriously playing</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.430" end="01:41:07.290" style="s2">together you know joy is going to be</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.990" end="01:41:08.850" style="s2">hampered joy is going to be concerned</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.290" end="01:41:11.970" style="s2">with whether or not it&#39;s vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.850" end="01:41:14.340" style="s2">expression is in some sense unsafe so</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.970" end="01:41:16.920" style="s2">what are your thoughts on that mode of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.340" end="01:41:20.970" style="s2">inquiry oh that&#39;s that&#39;s very that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.920" end="01:41:23.760" style="s2">very very important one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.970" end="01:41:25.620" style="s2">try to do is in order to discharge some</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.760" end="01:41:29.180" style="s2">of the reactivity around the words I</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.620" end="01:41:32.160" style="s2">often shift to yin and yang rather than</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.180" end="01:41:33.710" style="s2">feminine and masculine because that</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.160" end="01:41:36.900" style="s2">those tend to have a more ontological</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.710" end="01:41:39.440" style="s2">Association as as opposed to they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.900" end="01:41:42.480" style="s2">highly politicized understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.440" end="01:41:44.100" style="s2">masculine and feminine not that there</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.480" end="01:41:46.050" style="s2">aren&#39;t important political issues there</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.100" end="01:41:47.670" style="s2">are not I&#39;m not denying the history of</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.050" end="01:41:50.130" style="s2">feminism or its value I&#39;m just saying</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.670" end="01:41:51.630" style="s2">that sometimes it&#39;s hard to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.130" end="01:41:55.110" style="s2">the things you want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.630" end="01:42:01.110" style="s2">notice how there&#39;s trepidation yeah how</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.110" end="01:42:06.870" style="s2">you&#39;re moving around these words so the</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.110" end="01:42:10.160" style="s2">yin and yang aspects to me call me in so</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.870" end="01:42:12.240" style="s2">wonderfully when I move from adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.160" end="01:42:15.030" style="s2">Procera framing to an opponent</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.240" end="01:42:18.870" style="s2">processing and then I see this very much</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.030" end="01:42:24.840" style="s2">at work in circling in which I men and</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.870" end="01:42:27.330" style="s2">women in in the circling right and you</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.840" end="01:42:29.190" style="s2">the there is all kinds of overly</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.330" end="01:42:29.430" style="s2">simplistic things Oh everybody&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.190" end="01:42:31.650" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.430" end="01:42:33.630" style="s2">that&#39;s ridiculous being a man being a</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.650" end="01:42:37.860" style="s2">woman that makes a difference pretend it</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.630" end="01:42:39.890" style="s2">doesn&#39;t is his pretense ah but also to</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.860" end="01:42:42.330" style="s2">come up with simple you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.890" end="01:42:44.730" style="s2">categorizations of what that means is</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.330" end="01:42:46.080" style="s2">also that&#39;s why again I try to use this</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.730" end="01:42:48.510" style="s2">you know yang because these these are</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.080" end="01:42:51.450" style="s2">much more comprehensive and Eve and you</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.510" end="01:42:54.390" style="s2">know multi vocal terms right and and and</p>

<p begin="01:42:54.390" end="01:42:58.650" style="s2">in the symbol of the Dow they are</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.860" end="01:43:01.470" style="s2">represented in dynamic relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.650" end="01:43:06.150" style="s2">interpenetrating each other with no with</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.470" end="01:43:12.030" style="s2">no sexual intent meant there and and so</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.150" end="01:43:15.320" style="s2">I see I see that the people that come</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.030" end="01:43:18.390" style="s2">into circling and I&#39;m deeply grateful to</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.320" end="01:43:20.790" style="s2">to meet these people and I can even see</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.390" end="01:43:23.070" style="s2">it within a person like when when guy is</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.790" end="01:43:24.510" style="s2">doing his thing or retort and is doing</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.070" end="01:43:29.850" style="s2">his thing and I mean that thing with</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.510" end="01:43:32.730" style="s2">respect I don&#39;t mean if I like I see</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.850" end="01:43:35.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep reverence for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.730" end="01:43:39.150" style="s2">expansion of the yang and the traction</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.670" end="01:43:41.460" style="s2">of the end the the variety the the</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.150" end="01:43:43.680" style="s2">attempt to project of the yang the</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.460" end="01:43:45.930" style="s2">attempt to sensitize at the end and that</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.680" end="01:43:48.480" style="s2">and if they&#39;re there if they&#39;re flowing</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.930" end="01:43:50.340" style="s2">and you get this scent of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.480" end="01:43:52.260" style="s2">they&#39;re both sort of parametric</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.340" end="01:43:54.420" style="s2">constraints on the self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.260" end="01:43:56.340" style="s2">process it goes on and people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.420" end="01:43:58.680" style="s2">trying to pin them down or position</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.340" end="01:44:00.540" style="s2">themselves as representing one of this</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.680" end="01:44:02.190" style="s2">constraints rather what they want to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:00.540" end="01:44:05.100" style="s2">is they want to participate as fully as</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.190" end="01:44:06.600" style="s2">possible if the rhythm of the process</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.100" end="01:44:08.580" style="s2">that&#39;s taking place within the space</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.600" end="01:44:09.720" style="s2">that is constituted by the by the</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.580" end="01:44:11.430" style="s2">constraints so they&#39;re trying to hold</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.720" end="01:44:13.530" style="s2">the constraints within opponent</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.430" end="01:44:15.750" style="s2">processing rather than position</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.530" end="01:44:18.630" style="s2">themselves adversarial as representative</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.750" end="01:44:21.420" style="s2">of the polls and put them into some kind</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.630" end="01:44:25.490" style="s2">of competition with each other now I</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.420" end="01:44:28.200" style="s2">think all of that is very very important</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.490" end="01:44:31.710" style="s2">now we have to take great care because</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.200" end="01:44:34.080" style="s2">that that that is a very real</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.710" end="01:44:35.880" style="s2">possibility and it is a possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.080" end="01:44:38.440" style="s2">both the men and the women I think in</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.880" end="01:44:41.800" style="s2">the circling deeply value I</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.440" end="01:44:43.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that is my I have come I have a</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.800" end="01:44:48.460" style="s2">strong conviction that that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.000" end="01:44:50.349" style="s2">seeing in the circle so are you still</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.460" end="01:44:52.840" style="s2">there Tim yes I&#39;m here I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.349" end="01:44:54.280" style="s2">first yes yeah you fro yeah okay did you</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.840" end="01:44:55.719" style="s2">hear everything I said about both yes</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.280" end="01:44:56.170" style="s2">both the men and women are deeply value</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.719" end="01:45:01.119" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.170" end="01:45:02.469" style="s2">and so I I want to acknowledge all of</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.119" end="01:45:04.360" style="s2">that and I want to acknowledge it</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.469" end="01:45:05.650" style="s2">reverentially and I want to recommend it</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.360" end="01:45:07.929" style="s2">as something you should be paying more</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.650" end="01:45:11.469" style="s2">attention to that instead of positioning</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.929" end="01:45:12.969" style="s2">and adversarial we can we can hold the</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.469" end="01:45:15.400" style="s2">opponent processing and move to the</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.969" end="01:45:17.590" style="s2">space given by the constraints right I</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.400" end="01:45:20.800" style="s2">want to acknowledge that reverentially</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.590" end="01:45:23.559" style="s2">while also acknowledging that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.800" end="01:45:25.750" style="s2">address all the traumatic damage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.559" end="01:45:29.010" style="s2">been done and by the kind of disconnect</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.750" end="01:45:31.840" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the way in which we</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.010" end="01:45:34.780" style="s2">for all kinds of cultural historical and</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.840" end="01:45:38.110" style="s2">psychopathological regions have hurt</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.780" end="01:45:40.889" style="s2">each other around you know issues of</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.110" end="01:45:48.010" style="s2">gender and masculine and the feminine</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.889" end="01:45:51.340" style="s2">III I think I think I think what I want</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.010" end="01:45:53.380" style="s2">to say there is my one criticism about</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.340" end="01:45:54.579" style="s2">how many people talk about for lack of a</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.380" end="01:45:56.320" style="s2">better adjective and it&#39;s not quite the</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.579" end="01:45:57.909" style="s2">right adjective but it&#39;s the one that</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.320" end="01:45:59.679" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use right now how people talk</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.909" end="01:46:02.440" style="s2">about the political aspect if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.679" end="01:46:06.429" style="s2">one criticism I have is it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.440" end="01:46:10.599" style="s2">that the expression of anger and</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.429" end="01:46:15.309" style="s2">resentment on both sides or multiple</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.599" end="01:46:17.650" style="s2">sites I guess is being prioritized over</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.309" end="01:46:20.349" style="s2">trying to create a shared goal of</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.650" end="01:46:24.219" style="s2">bringing about healing from the trauma</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.349" end="01:46:27.309" style="s2">and here&#39;s how the two points connect</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.219" end="01:46:31.420" style="s2">together I think if we recover the</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.309" end="01:46:34.000" style="s2">yin-yang dynamism that can tell us that</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.420" end="01:46:36.969" style="s2">it that healing is really possible and</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.000" end="01:46:41.260" style="s2">that therefore we should be balancing</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.969" end="01:46:44.920" style="s2">the needed criticism with the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.260" end="01:46:47.320" style="s2">prioritizing of the goal of healing and</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.920" end="01:46:49.300" style="s2">that is not to trivialize or equate</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.320" end="01:46:50.990" style="s2">everybody&#39;s suffering or to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.300" end="01:46:53.090" style="s2">simplistic like that</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.990" end="01:46:56.360" style="s2">right I&#39;m not I&#39;m I hope I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.090" end="01:46:59.870" style="s2">stupid here in that fashion but I do</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.360" end="01:47:04.310" style="s2">think that you&#39;re running out of time</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.870" end="01:47:07.250" style="s2">and we&#39;ve got to figure out how to more</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.310" end="01:47:10.130" style="s2">deeply live together and love together</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.250" end="01:47:12.650" style="s2">and work and play together and develop</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.130" end="01:47:15.890" style="s2">together if we&#39;re gonna save things and</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.650" end="01:47:19.570" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got to give more priority to</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.890" end="01:47:22.400" style="s2">the healing we just have to do I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.570" end="01:47:37.090" style="s2">don&#39;t see a real alternative for all of</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.400" end="01:47:37.090" style="s2">us together yes yes yes and the movement</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.510" end="01:47:47.140" style="s2">we not us in terms of us and them this</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.090" end="01:47:49.730" style="s2">how can we as part of this yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.140" end="01:47:52.850" style="s2">opponent processing is I could the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.730" end="01:47:55.310" style="s2">rhythm I I love the metaphors I speak so</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.850" end="01:47:58.700" style="s2">much most mostly to open up to people</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.310" end="01:48:02.000" style="s2">about where I&#39;m where I&#39;m thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.700" end="01:48:04.880" style="s2">feeling and how I&#39;m being in the world</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.000" end="01:48:08.330" style="s2">is through the metaphor of rhythm and</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.880" end="01:48:11.450" style="s2">music what I&#39;m finding most powerful is</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.330" end="01:48:14.660" style="s2">this notion of the deep drums stuff tap</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.450" end="01:48:18.920" style="s2">in and feel into the deep drums that are</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.660" end="01:48:22.640" style="s2">present you know all the noise all the</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.920" end="01:48:29.660" style="s2">noise it is a it&#39;s an innate capacity of</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.640" end="01:48:32.600" style="s2">all of us to dig deep yeah yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.660" end="01:48:34.520" style="s2">like the shamanic associations that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.600" end="01:48:35.660" style="s2">calling for I think that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.520" end="01:48:37.940" style="s2">that&#39;s very wonderful that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.660" end="01:48:40.910" style="s2">thank you that&#39;s very I like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.940" end="01:48:49.040" style="s2">metaphor a lot too deep drums yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.910" end="01:48:51.290" style="s2">think I think you know I it worries me</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.040" end="01:48:56.810" style="s2">because we&#39;re you know the adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.290" end="01:49:00.020" style="s2">processing is becoming so so prominent</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.810" end="01:49:02.450" style="s2">and such it&#39;s being sort of indicated as</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.020" end="01:49:05.030" style="s2">so meshed with the only way to have</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.450" end="01:49:09.530" style="s2">power and influence I do worry</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.030" end="01:49:13.550" style="s2">about our ability to get back to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.530" end="01:49:15.140" style="s2">sense of opponent processing see the to</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.550" end="01:49:17.540" style="s2">me one of the one of the crucial</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.140" end="01:49:18.590" style="s2">differences is in opponent processing</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.540" end="01:49:21.440" style="s2">and this is again the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.590" end="01:49:23.420" style="s2">dialogue and monologue it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.440" end="01:49:26.330" style="s2">difference between phyleus ophea and phi</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.420" end="01:49:29.990" style="s2">lea nykeya the love of wisdom versus the</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.330" end="01:49:35.060" style="s2">love of victory right is that we what we</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.990" end="01:49:38.780" style="s2">should share above both of us always is</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.060" end="01:49:41.170" style="s2">a commitment to the process as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.780" end="01:49:44.300" style="s2">to the victory of whatever position</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.170" end="01:49:46.220" style="s2">we&#39;re advocating and see democracies</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.300" end="01:49:48.380" style="s2">were supposed to and they did for a long</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.220" end="01:49:51.110" style="s2">time work and people being committed to</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.380" end="01:49:54.680" style="s2">the process and the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.110" end="01:49:57.290" style="s2">conflict within right between the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.680" end="01:49:59.780" style="s2">parties was ultimately the best way to</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.290" end="01:50:03.500" style="s2">embody self-correction that what we were</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.780" end="01:50:05.570" style="s2">actually invested in was because I think</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.500" end="01:50:08.150" style="s2">the ultimate value of democracy is its</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.570" end="01:50:10.880" style="s2">capacity for self correction that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.150" end="01:50:12.350" style="s2">sets it above the other systems and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.880" end="01:50:13.730" style="s2">think once it loses self correction it</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.350" end="01:50:15.440" style="s2">becomes what Winston Churchill I mean</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.730" end="01:50:16.610" style="s2">it&#39;s the worst - next in which the</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.440" end="01:50:17.870" style="s2">Churchill said it&#39;s the worst system</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.610" end="01:50:20.300" style="s2">next to all the rest but I think if you</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.870" end="01:50:21.620" style="s2">remove that the commitment is self</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.300" end="01:50:25.220" style="s2">correction then it just simply becomes</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.620" end="01:50:28.160" style="s2">the worst system right and and so I</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.220" end="01:50:33.250" style="s2">think that you have to have a commitment</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.160" end="01:50:35.360" style="s2">to the process because of an unwavering</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.250" end="01:50:38.630" style="s2">understanding and appreciation and</p>
