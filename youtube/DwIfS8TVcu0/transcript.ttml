<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:15.780" style="s2">it was secure attachment mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">that&#39;s good yeah and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.780" end="00:07:20.699" style="s2">that&#39;s novel again that&#39;s like something</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:27.090" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t think that that could happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.699" end="00:07:29.490" style="s2">to somebody like me yeah well I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.090" end="00:07:32.130" style="s2">imagine it it&#39;s funny because you talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.490" end="00:07:34.680" style="s2">about being a walker between worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.130" end="00:07:37.880" style="s2">myself wanderer and I said I can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.680" end="00:07:40.889" style="s2">but think of Hermes right like Hermes is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.880" end="00:07:42.990" style="s2">you know the it Hermes is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.889" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">unique God you know herb you nedick&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.990" end="00:07:49.620" style="s2">like like the you know the kind of God</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:52.349" style="s2">of language which which is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.620" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">in-between world right so Hermes is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.349" end="00:07:58.759" style="s2">between like is not completely a god and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.930" end="00:08:03.449" style="s2">not not completely human but this this</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.759" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">between worlds but like it&#39;s home is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.449" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">place where they paradoxically come</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:09.509" style="s2">together so language right so it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:11.699" style="s2">one level it&#39;s like language it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.509" end="00:08:14.069" style="s2">paradoxical obviously because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.699" end="00:08:15.960" style="s2">the word isn&#39;t the thing that it</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.069" end="00:08:18.569" style="s2">describes yet it makes the thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.960" end="00:08:23.460" style="s2">available and it couldn&#39;t be without it</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.569" end="00:08:27.210" style="s2">that whole home homelessness kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.460" end="00:08:30.300" style="s2">thing and I think I think it was I you</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.210" end="00:08:33.899" style="s2">know I think it was Hillman pointed this</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.300" end="00:08:35.969" style="s2">out I think it was Hillman where he</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.899" end="00:08:40.140" style="s2">talked about it&#39;s interesting he talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.969" end="00:08:43.890" style="s2">about that Hermes</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.140" end="00:08:47.220" style="s2">I think mythically is wedded to Hestia</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.890" end="00:08:49.180" style="s2">or one of the goddesses that is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:52.450" style="s2">goddess of domesticity</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.180" end="00:08:57.970" style="s2">right and he and he talked about like in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.450" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">his clinical practice where how if home</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.970" end="00:09:04.600" style="s2">if Hermes goes manic and like divorces</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:09.100" style="s2">his wife you end up with these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.600" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">poo air yeah like you know boys you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.100" end="00:09:12.850" style="s2">or Icarus going you know flying too</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:16.270" style="s2">close to the Sun and then falling right</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.850" end="00:09:18.760" style="s2">both but when Hermes is in right</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.270" end="00:09:23.890" style="s2">relationship right this it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.760" end="00:09:28.090" style="s2">how like how this this this homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.890" end="00:09:31.420" style="s2">right it&#39;s is wedded to domesticity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.090" end="00:09:32.170" style="s2">so when you said truly yeah that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.420" end="00:09:38.190" style="s2">very trying</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.170" end="00:09:40.360" style="s2">yeah my life it also made me think of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.190" end="00:09:42.010" style="s2">you know the buddhist teacher chögyam</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.360" end="00:09:43.870" style="s2">trungpa he talks about you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.010" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">become a Buddhist you take refuge in</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.870" end="00:09:49.750" style="s2">being homeless so so there&#39;s this sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:51.880" style="s2">of like was the sort of paradox is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.750" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">like is like okay you&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.880" end="00:09:55.780" style="s2">attached to some place but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:10:01.000" style="s2">time you&#39;re making a commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:10:04.330" style="s2">something yeah yes say that against it</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.000" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">so that kind of hit me being refuge -</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.330" end="00:10:10.840" style="s2">how did you put that well you take</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:14.080" style="s2">refuge is like a traditional Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.840" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">thing right you take refuge in and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.080" end="00:10:19.300" style="s2">take refuge in being homeless right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">not being attached to you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.300" end="00:10:24.100" style="s2">different levels of it not attached to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:27.430" style="s2">place but also not attached to an</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.100" end="00:10:28.870" style="s2">identity or not attached to something at</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.430" end="00:10:31.420" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.870" end="00:10:35.160" style="s2">commitment so so I guess that&#39;s the did</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.420" end="00:10:35.160" style="s2">that when I thought of the domesticity</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.190" end="00:10:44.290" style="s2">and the let&#39;s say the wildness media</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.190" end="00:10:45.490" style="s2">meeting and creating something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.290" end="00:10:49.150" style="s2">kind of alive</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.490" end="00:10:51.880" style="s2">does that that makes sense totally well</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.150" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">I would imagine in some level you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.880" end="00:10:58.060" style="s2">there&#39;s you know if I look if I watch</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">you for example like all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.060" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">kind of hearing I get this sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:02.180" style="s2">oh yeah but maybe the right cuz I know</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:04.970" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.180" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">for me marriage and this whole thing had</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.970" end="00:11:10.490" style="s2">secure attachment before yeah yours oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:13.430" style="s2">well yeah I didn&#39;t even like until I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.490" end="00:11:17.589" style="s2">it I was I started to experience it us</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.430" end="00:11:20.149" style="s2">whoa what the hell is this right this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.589" end="00:11:22.310" style="s2">what I used to what used to look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.149" end="00:11:24.529" style="s2">prison to me feels like the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.310" end="00:11:27.220" style="s2">freedom in the world right like you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.529" end="00:11:32.170" style="s2">and one of those so it&#39;s so simple but</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.220" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">but I kind of got this sense of oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.170" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">like the right thing goes in the center</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:43.070" style="s2">of the mandala and then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">mandala yeah right and so I know yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.070" end="00:11:48.230" style="s2">just kind of got that sense of just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:50.089" style="s2">here you are like on some level one at</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.230" end="00:11:52.339" style="s2">least my experience of you is your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.089" end="00:11:55.370" style="s2">things are gathering around you like</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.339" end="00:11:59.779" style="s2">your channels right you&#39;re right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.370" end="00:12:02.120" style="s2">a stability in your presence at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.779" end="00:12:03.709" style="s2">not lying and what I&#39;m hearing you talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.120" end="00:12:04.970" style="s2">about like there&#39;s a get you as a place</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.020" end="00:12:12.920" style="s2">coming yeah well I seem to have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.209" end="00:12:15.110" style="s2">knack for meeting interesting people</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.920" end="00:12:18.380" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.110" end="00:12:20.570" style="s2">to be a student and to have you know on</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.380" end="00:12:21.950" style="s2">some level right that&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.570" end="00:12:23.959" style="s2">think that&#39;s one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.950" end="00:12:27.380" style="s2">missing in this culture is is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.959" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">people people who you know people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.380" end="00:12:34.339" style="s2">look for older people you know as models</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">models for them and I&#39;ve always done</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.339" end="00:12:40.640" style="s2">that so I&#39;ve always I&#39;ve always almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:44.540" style="s2">met very powerful older older men</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.640" end="00:12:49.010" style="s2">usually yeah huh and I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.540" end="00:12:51.079" style="s2">learned that way what happens because in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.010" end="00:12:53.630" style="s2">my own family situation it was very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.079" end="00:12:56.510" style="s2">let&#39;s say I I spent most of my teenage</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.630" end="00:12:59.510" style="s2">taught tied with met with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.510" end="00:13:01.310" style="s2">right yeah you know and I and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.510" end="00:13:03.500" style="s2">experienced the feminine world very very</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.310" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">intensely as a younger person and I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.500" end="00:13:08.149" style="s2">didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">masculinity and the same time I guess</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.149" end="00:13:15.080" style="s2">there was a search for for like cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:21.380" style="s2">father figure on some level and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.080" end="00:13:24.670" style="s2">oh yeah totally so that there&#39;s a sipper</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.380" end="00:13:27.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a way where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.670" end="00:13:32.510" style="s2">would have met for one as I late to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.620" end="00:13:35.150" style="s2">right I relate to that sense of what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:38.150" style="s2">personally had people that have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.150" end="00:13:42.070" style="s2">just really really deep and smart and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.150" end="00:13:45.650" style="s2">wise and multiple dimensions um</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.070" end="00:13:50.540" style="s2">throughout my life that take me under</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.650" end="00:13:52.130" style="s2">their wing and and and in some way one</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.540" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">of the things that they did is they</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.130" end="00:13:57.740" style="s2">taught me how to learn I think right</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:13:59.900" style="s2">like the only stories they&#39;d relate to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.740" end="00:14:03.590" style="s2">me in some way that would have some</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.900" end="00:14:05.210" style="s2">wisdom right and I they they on one</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.590" end="00:14:06.980" style="s2">level I was learning everything that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.210" end="00:14:12.890" style="s2">they were teaching me but at another</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.980" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">level I think I was they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.890" end="00:14:19.520" style="s2">simultaneously teaching me how to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:22.400" style="s2">taught how to learn mm-hmm and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.520" end="00:14:24.440" style="s2">that&#39;s got really deep in me made me</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.400" end="00:14:26.420" style="s2">think of you you mentioned Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.440" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">I remember there&#39;s a quote Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.420" end="00:14:30.890" style="s2">saying the bet that the best teacher is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:32.090" style="s2">the top learner like he&#39;s learning all</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.890" end="00:14:34.970" style="s2">the time and people are just being</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.090" end="00:14:37.280" style="s2">lifted up with him yeah so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.970" end="00:14:39.620" style="s2">he&#39;s teaching people he&#39;s he&#39;s learning</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.280" end="00:14:40.730" style="s2">and then he&#39;s lifting up everybody right</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.620" end="00:14:42.890" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.730" end="00:14:44.930" style="s2">yes exactly letting learn I think he</p>

<p begin="00:18:16.600" end="00:18:23.080" style="s2">arose out of so we can stand on them to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">to to dive deeper in the mystery in</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:43.780" style="s2">goes underneath that so there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.010" end="00:18:45.789" style="s2">would say that that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.780" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">commonality of all the people that we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.309" end="00:22:39.539" style="s2">that presuppose that all those things</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.539" end="00:22:42.149" style="s2">have a particular meaning yeah don&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.539" end="00:22:44.100" style="s2">Dunkel on being questioned and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.149" end="00:22:45.629" style="s2">thinking is not happening right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.100" end="00:22:47.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like what Heidegger would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.629" end="00:22:51.029" style="s2">thinking the thinking is not happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.580" end="00:22:57.210" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s kind of yeah it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.029" end="00:22:59.730" style="s2">of salon activity yes yes yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.210" end="00:23:03.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like that so you&#39;re you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.730" end="00:23:06.389" style="s2">like the like that like the earth around</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.570" end="00:23:09.330" style="s2">it is I think it&#39;s intelligent I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.389" end="00:23:12.029" style="s2">it&#39;s really really intelligent because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.330" end="00:23:13.859" style="s2">there&#39;s something else available you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.029" end="00:23:17.749" style="s2">know which i think is where circling</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.859" end="00:23:20.460" style="s2">their the circling for me and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.749" end="00:23:23.249" style="s2">historically like how it started at my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.460" end="00:23:26.460" style="s2">grappling with it and the in the in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.249" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">the trenches with the people like as we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.460" end="00:23:31.950" style="s2">were discovering it it wasn&#39;t really the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:35.700" style="s2">essence of it wasn&#39;t about it had</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.950" end="00:23:38.669" style="s2">nothing to do with even personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.700" end="00:23:43.649" style="s2">the notion of personal growth it was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.669" end="00:23:48.690" style="s2">about evoking a wonder right a in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.649" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">phenomenological that there&#39;s an that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.690" end="00:23:54.299" style="s2">that there is at all right like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.010" style="s2">this sense of I think that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.299" end="00:24:00.750" style="s2">were all</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.010" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">at the beach around the fire that as we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.750" end="00:24:05.010" style="s2">were circling what what were we doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:07.020" style="s2">when we were doing all of that like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.010" end="00:24:09.510" style="s2">spirit of it was is like what I kept</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.020" end="00:24:11.400" style="s2">feeling like that fire kept circling</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.510" end="00:24:13.250" style="s2">around that fire together and like going</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.400" end="00:24:19.880" style="s2">through this and talking about our lives</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.250" end="00:24:22.410" style="s2">would lead to these the presence of life</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.880" end="00:24:24.510" style="s2">in the moment and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.410" end="00:24:26.250" style="s2">describe it and then realizing they</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.510" end="00:24:28.470" style="s2">would go away in the description but</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.250" end="00:24:30.000" style="s2">something would come come forward and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.470" end="00:24:32.910" style="s2">it&#39;s going away and then bringing</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.000" end="00:24:36.570" style="s2">language to it and that sense of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.910" end="00:24:41.730" style="s2">like philosophical intimacy right that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.570" end="00:24:44.360" style="s2">sense of right exoticness that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.730" end="00:24:47.010" style="s2">constantly eludes you but yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.360" end="00:24:51.540" style="s2">constitutes you at the same time yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.010" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">that to me that&#39;s the heart of circling</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.540" end="00:24:58.020" style="s2">right I think I can feel why you are so</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:59.160" style="s2">influenced by Heidegger right and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.020" end="00:25:00.809" style="s2">doing that when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.160" end="00:25:03.030" style="s2">this this sort of getting underneath</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.809" end="00:25:05.700" style="s2">concepts right getting underneath</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.030" end="00:25:08.250" style="s2">everything and keeping it keeping it all</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.700" end="00:25:11.100" style="s2">dynamic and alive without getting fixed</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.250" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">in some kind of right no keeping that</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.100" end="00:25:15.809" style="s2">like as I think everything in Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">should have moves towards poetry at some</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.809" end="00:25:22.140" style="s2">level but poor time between people</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.140" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">totally yeah so that so on one level I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.860" end="00:25:33.190" style="s2">because then I really heard you when you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.299" end="00:25:40.870" style="s2">said like keep everything alive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.190" end="00:25:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s more like keep noticing how how the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.870" end="00:25:48.280" style="s2">how I how I don&#39;t recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.530" end="00:25:50.470" style="s2">aliveness right it&#39;s like it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.280" end="00:25:53.110" style="s2">like revealing that everything&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.470" end="00:25:58.780" style="s2">right it&#39;s like there&#39;s a that there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.110" end="00:26:03.090" style="s2">something alive and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.780" end="00:26:07.410" style="s2">something about our time that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.090" end="00:26:11.950" style="s2">take that aliveness and make it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.410" end="00:26:14.140" style="s2">extract it water eyes make it you kill</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.950" end="00:26:16.750" style="s2">it make it dead dead you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.140" end="00:26:18.850" style="s2">walking around with corpses everywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.750" end="00:26:24.610" style="s2">mean yeah and we&#39;re you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.850" end="00:26:26.230" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the zombie image right yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.610" end="00:26:29.620" style="s2">there&#39;s and we have this inside of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.230" end="00:26:34.059" style="s2">ourselves where we slip into kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.620" end="00:26:37.330" style="s2">dull state yeah we&#39;re not as alive as we</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.059" end="00:26:39.540" style="s2">could be yeah and and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.330" end="00:26:42.610" style="s2">reasons for that one reason is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.540" end="00:26:47.830" style="s2">that we&#39;re all so hyper socially</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.610" end="00:26:51.250" style="s2">conscious and you know of our role and</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.830" end="00:26:53.860" style="s2">our you know our job and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.250" end="00:26:57.100" style="s2">can we be ourselves how can we flourish</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.860" end="00:27:02.290" style="s2">as our you know well ourselves but how</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.100" end="00:27:04.179" style="s2">can we just you know yeah we think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.290" end="00:27:06.340" style="s2">the the actual work like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.179" end="00:27:08.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to make it sound like just</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.340" end="00:27:10.390" style="s2">being yourself being authentic is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.620" end="00:27:12.580" style="s2">point it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.390" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a discipline and work as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.580" end="00:27:19.710" style="s2">supposed to things I think about this</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:21.480" style="s2">notion of authenticity right is is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.710" end="00:27:23.530" style="s2">yeah if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.480" end="00:27:26.650" style="s2">psychologically it usually means</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.530" end="00:27:30.150" style="s2">something like alright so thing inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.650" end="00:27:33.070" style="s2">you know he matches the thing outside</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.150" end="00:27:36.040" style="s2">when inside matches outside I&#39;m being</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.070" end="00:27:39.580" style="s2">authentic you know which is is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.040" end="00:27:42.220" style="s2">usually can can turn into like like you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.580" end="00:27:44.950" style="s2">know I just keep revealing myself review</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.220" end="00:27:50.380" style="s2">myself revealing myself right however I</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.950" end="00:27:53.860" style="s2">think that&#39;s a on top gray authenticity</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.380" end="00:27:55.780" style="s2">is something I think more primordial</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.860" end="00:27:58.210" style="s2">than that I would imagine right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.780" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2">more like it like it&#39;s right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.210" end="00:28:02.490" style="s2">discipline to it right when I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.860" end="00:28:09.700" style="s2">about you know authenticity like author</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.490" end="00:28:11.830" style="s2">right it is it&#39;s more like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.700" end="00:28:14.980" style="s2">well you&#39;re in touch with the muse on</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.830" end="00:28:18.549" style="s2">some level it&#39;s not you yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.980" end="00:28:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not your personality yeah wise not</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.549" end="00:28:22.929" style="s2">even your it&#39;s not even your multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.440" end="00:28:24.730" style="s2">you&#39;re not even your you know Gert chef</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.929" end="00:28:26.409" style="s2">says or something man is legion we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.730" end="00:28:28.750" style="s2">all these millions of sub personnel is</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.409" end="00:28:31.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not even those voices something</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.750" end="00:28:35.049" style="s2">something coming from beyond right that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.780" end="00:28:38.950" style="s2">multiplicity I think and being being be</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.049" end="00:28:43.030" style="s2">having a coherent tonality to it or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.950" end="00:28:45.549" style="s2">make tonality a Co hate Co here you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.030" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">this is the thing about about I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.549" end="00:28:51.870" style="s2">authenticity if we say authenticity is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:55.030" style="s2">something like on concealment and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:56.770" style="s2">inauthenticity is is is something like</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.030" end="00:29:00.309" style="s2">concealment right there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:03.549" style="s2">about those two things right um so so</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.309" end="00:29:06.039" style="s2">like authenticity I think primarily has</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.549" end="00:29:09.480" style="s2">to do with a way of tending and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.039" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">listening to what is most primordial</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.480" end="00:29:14.820" style="s2">right and I think in our times it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:17.830" style="s2">listening to that which is most near</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.820" end="00:29:20.049" style="s2">right that which is the horizon that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.830" end="00:29:25.210" style="s2">that I&#39;m seeing with that I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.049" end="00:29:26.770" style="s2">right that it and so on some level yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.210" end="00:29:30.630" style="s2">I think I&#39;m some level in acting</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.770" end="00:29:34.360" style="s2">authenticity is more like not just like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.630" end="00:29:37.299" style="s2">if I wanna so I want to like if I want</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.360" end="00:29:39.669" style="s2">to like if I mr. bata in public public</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.299" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">or like right now it&#39;s famous Greek</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.669" end="00:29:44.140" style="s2">philosopher I forget yeah totally that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">craziness you know that&#39;s of it but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.140" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">think it&#39;s more like taking up a role in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">the culture ray and</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:57.320" style="s2">and not just doing what I want but</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:59.510" style="s2">really taking it on is like similar to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.320" end="00:30:03.380" style="s2">reading a text right it&#39;s like reading</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.510" end="00:30:05.269" style="s2">the text so deeply right so like reading</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.380" end="00:30:08.929" style="s2">all of it right so we&#39;re kind of trying</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.269" end="00:30:10.789" style="s2">to read it like where the word if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.929" end="00:30:14.779" style="s2">where you&#39;re waking up the dead author</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.789" end="00:30:17.269" style="s2">because you feel you feel so right to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.779" end="00:30:20.120" style="s2">the point where you read it so fully but</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.269" end="00:30:22.870" style="s2">at some point you turn the next chapter</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.120" end="00:30:27.220" style="s2">and do you find yourself writing it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.870" end="00:30:30.679" style="s2">right in that sense of that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.220" end="00:30:32.779" style="s2">authorship is well you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.679" end="00:30:34.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what I said about being a student</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.779" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">right that&#39;s probably the beginning part</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.820" end="00:30:38.120" style="s2">when you&#39;re reading the book and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:40.760" style="s2">keep reading the book and you keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.120" end="00:30:43.970" style="s2">reading the book and keep it and all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.760" end="00:30:45.710" style="s2">different you know nuances and shades</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.970" end="00:30:47.539" style="s2">and colors of the book kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.710" end="00:30:49.639" style="s2">and until you&#39;re actually yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.539" end="00:30:50.899" style="s2">you are you&#39;re writing the book that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.639" end="00:30:52.730" style="s2">yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.899" end="00:30:54.980" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.730" end="00:30:58.429" style="s2">one writing the book absolutely the book</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.980" end="00:31:00.620" style="s2">of your life or whatever yes yes and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.429" end="00:31:02.630" style="s2">I think it like it&#39;s for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.620" end="00:31:04.250" style="s2">practice of circling and so one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.630" end="00:31:06.950" style="s2">just want to say it&#39;s like I there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.250" end="00:31:08.570" style="s2">there&#39;s a definitely circling there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.950" end="00:31:10.100" style="s2">circling and then there&#39;s guys saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.570" end="00:31:12.590" style="s2">stalks and they&#39;re definitely not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.100" end="00:31:15.230" style="s2">same thing right in fact I think if</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.590" end="00:31:17.090" style="s2">anything I&#39;ve always I&#39;m always the one</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.230" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">at the edges of everything kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.090" end="00:31:20.779" style="s2">listening to the whistle istening to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:23.419" style="s2">circling and listening to what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.779" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">beyond and what&#39;s under it right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.419" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">probably more disruptive to circling</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:33.740" style="s2">then I think it&#39;s always just been my</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:36.289" style="s2">proclivity the but I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:38.299" style="s2">things that when you learn how to circle</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.289" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">right it&#39;s very much that listening</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.299" end="00:31:43.549" style="s2">that&#39;s really the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:46.669" style="s2">practicing it&#39;s the booby prize is</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.549" end="00:31:49.610" style="s2">connection right the booby prize is</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.669" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">intimacy right huh but it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.610" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">like what it takes to be intimate are</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:57.529" style="s2">all of these deep things right and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:59.570" style="s2">because if you just think about it if</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.529" end="00:32:02.419" style="s2">you&#39;re I mean if you want to get closer</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.570" end="00:32:05.630" style="s2">to the cosmos right if you want to if</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.419" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">you want to really know</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.630" end="00:32:13.190" style="s2">about reality no you might as well look</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:15.530" style="s2">in the most complex part of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.190" end="00:32:19.310" style="s2">right which it seems to be the human</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.530" end="00:32:21.680" style="s2">face and probably talk they probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.310" end="00:32:25.520" style="s2">want to look at the part of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.680" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">that can actually talk well I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.520" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">thinking about when you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:30.620" style="s2">about intimacy I was thinking about my</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:34.550" style="s2">wife and I and our intimacy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.620" end="00:32:36.290" style="s2">thinking you can&#39;t really define and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:39.740" style="s2">any kind of way and it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.290" end="00:32:41.750" style="s2">different than what you would imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.740" end="00:32:44.030" style="s2">would be right it&#39;s very different like</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.750" end="00:32:45.380" style="s2">if you&#39;re a young person and you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.030" end="00:32:47.630" style="s2">know looking for a partner or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.380" end="00:32:50.210" style="s2">and you&#39;re you have all these needs and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.630" end="00:32:52.910" style="s2">you want this kind of person and and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.210" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">then you you you you know you meet this</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.910" end="00:32:55.550" style="s2">kind of person and then you meet another</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:57.950" style="s2">pretty that doesn&#39;t work out and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.550" end="00:33:02.420" style="s2">meet another person and you kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:04.070" style="s2">then then you discover intimacy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.420" end="00:33:06.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.070" end="00:33:08.540" style="s2">different right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.170" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">same thing as whatever it is you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.540" end="00:33:12.350" style="s2">desiring or whatever it is you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.860" style="s2">that you thought would fulfill you in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.350" end="00:33:19.220" style="s2">some kind of a way it&#39;s it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.860" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">far deeper and and I don&#39;t I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.220" end="00:33:25.130" style="s2">what you know - hmm it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">wantable what it&#39;s unwanted oh yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.130" end="00:33:32.390" style="s2">like because to get it to experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:36.410" style="s2">intimacy is to be transformed by it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.390" end="00:33:38.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like if I say want intimacy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.410" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">it&#39;s almost gross or something isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.810" end="00:33:44.060" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like yeah it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:48.110" style="s2">you&#39;re imposing on on on Hunt&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.060" end="00:33:50.360" style="s2">something yeah that is right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.110" end="00:33:52.580" style="s2">already there or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.360" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">already the case like I would wear like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.580" end="00:33:56.360" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s just yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">there&#39;s something primordial we</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.360" end="00:34:07.310" style="s2">primordial II revealing about being our</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:11.450" style="s2">being my existing that becomes in in and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.310" end="00:34:13.220" style="s2">through the intimacy it&#39;s it&#39;s and and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.450" end="00:34:16.340" style="s2">think Jay people genuinely want intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.220" end="00:34:19.639" style="s2">right but but there is phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.340" end="00:34:21.799" style="s2">quality of that when you actually get it</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.639" end="00:34:24.169" style="s2">there&#39;s this experience of like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.799" end="00:34:26.799" style="s2">god this is there&#39;s no way I could like</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.169" end="00:34:30.259" style="s2">whenever I was thinking about it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.799" end="00:34:32.329" style="s2">right it is way more than I could have</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.259" end="00:34:35.480" style="s2">ever even have wanted or known to watch</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.329" end="00:34:41.569" style="s2">and in order and through having it I am</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.480" end="00:34:44.210" style="s2">now somebody that can I&#39;m now somebody</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.569" end="00:34:46.129" style="s2">different right that can actually Abbott</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.210" end="00:34:50.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s the thing about it them to</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.129" end="00:34:54.169" style="s2">see it&#39;s like it is very very man it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.239" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">like it&#39;s it creates it generate</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.169" end="00:34:59.150" style="s2">constitutes ourselves right like those</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:35:00.589" style="s2">moments if you think about I really</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.150" end="00:35:02.900" style="s2">appreciated the way that you talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.589" end="00:35:05.329" style="s2">about that like that yeah I think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.900" end="00:35:07.220" style="s2">like what I was doing talking to my</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.329" end="00:35:09.890" style="s2">friends over here maybe dating over here</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.220" end="00:35:11.420" style="s2">and then I had this intimacy with my</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.890" end="00:35:14.420" style="s2">wife and it&#39;s a completely different</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.420" end="00:35:19.849" style="s2">universe yeah when I heard you say well</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.420" end="00:35:24.829" style="s2">I was thinking about we the product we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.849" end="00:35:27.079" style="s2">tend to be interested in the product and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.829" end="00:35:30.859" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just it&#39;s not the process</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.079" end="00:35:32.779" style="s2">that that we&#39;re looking for the intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.859" end="00:35:39.619" style="s2">but it&#39;s you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.779" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">the living texture of mmm how would you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.619" end="00:35:45.079" style="s2">describe actually what when he when you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:49.849" style="s2">look at that contrast right as you said</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.079" end="00:35:54.460" style="s2">how would you describe the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.849" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">yourself it with with your partner that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.460" end="00:36:00.739" style="s2">is surprising what is the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:05.799" style="s2">of it like what does it look like feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.739" end="00:36:05.799" style="s2">like how as it transformed you if it has</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.150" end="00:36:17.930" style="s2">what is the tone us and as you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.660" end="00:36:21.769" style="s2">it well it&#39;s love but love is it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.930" end="00:36:23.329" style="s2">a it&#39;s such a abused word right so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.769" end="00:36:27.829" style="s2">don&#39;t want us I don&#39;t want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.329" end="00:36:30.279" style="s2">even though that&#39;s what it is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.829" end="00:36:30.279" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.340" end="00:36:36.450" style="s2">again although all of these words are</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.780" end="00:36:38.310" style="s2">just are just words right so I the other</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.450" end="00:36:43.380" style="s2">word that came to me is is divinity or</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.310" end="00:36:47.580" style="s2">divine or you know I was listening a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.380" end="00:36:49.800" style="s2">Java vacant he was saying you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.580" end="00:36:50.910" style="s2">he was wanted to talk about the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.800" end="00:36:53.730" style="s2">huh</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.910" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">and I was saying no it&#39;s not sacred it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.730" end="00:36:58.380" style="s2">divine and in other words it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:37:00.570" style="s2">just completely divine it&#39;s not sacred</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.380" end="00:37:03.150" style="s2">sacred is something a little it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.570" end="00:37:05.640" style="s2">little bit outside right it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.150" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">that you bow down to are you you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.640" end="00:37:11.340" style="s2">it&#39;s it has an aspirational quality yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:13.580" style="s2">but it but but intimacy in its ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.340" end="00:37:16.740" style="s2">sense is fully divine isn&#39;t it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.580" end="00:37:19.109" style="s2">yeah well what I think what I am</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.740" end="00:37:26.070" style="s2">imagining when I hear the word divine I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.109" end="00:37:28.859" style="s2">get the sense of something behind what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:32.010" style="s2">transcending because now I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.450" end="00:38:34.609" style="s2">quite thought of the divine or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.010" end="00:38:37.140" style="s2">difference between the two in this way</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.609" end="00:38:41.150" style="s2">but I think that you&#39;re right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.140" end="00:38:44.059" style="s2">there is this sense of um</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.230" end="00:39:07.039" style="s2">because whatever it is is so present and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.079" end="00:39:10.609" style="s2">breaks through that&#39;s so beyond what I</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.599" end="00:41:47.819" style="s2">like my only intention was I was I was</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.819" end="00:41:55.970" style="s2">like that I would go like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.170" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more possible in these</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.970" end="00:41:59.910" style="s2">conversations with these people I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:01.589" style="s2">Jesus like it was so much like so many</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.910" end="00:42:03.210" style="s2">things that were missed and they were</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.589" end="00:42:05.910" style="s2">giant kind of driving me nuts and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.210" end="00:42:07.619" style="s2">thought it was like somebody said guy</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.910" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">you ought to do a podcast you can get a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.619" end="00:42:10.890" style="s2">good interviewer that&#39;s like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:14.010" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of thinking about it I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.890" end="00:42:18.450" style="s2">like okay well maybe I can justify doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.010" end="00:42:22.109" style="s2">it I&#39;ll maybe this is a good way to to</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.450" end="00:42:24.390" style="s2">get to kind of get the word out so to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.109" end="00:42:26.369" style="s2">speak and I was thinking like it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.390" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">kind of interesting just to try to have</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.369" end="00:42:31.589" style="s2">a conversation where it was like it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:33.960" style="s2">a sweet spot between like you could say</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.589" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">like a normal conversation or interview</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.960" end="00:42:39.780" style="s2">and and something like circling like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:41.640" style="s2">what would be the sign not too weird</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.780" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">where people are like what the hell is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:47.130" style="s2">that right and it&#39;s so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.640" end="00:42:49.529" style="s2">it hits that sweet spot and yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.130" end="00:42:53.400" style="s2">don&#39;t like I was talking to Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.529" end="00:42:55.890" style="s2">Bonita Roy recently a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.400" end="00:42:58.440" style="s2">person and the first thing I said is I</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.890" end="00:43:00.809" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be formal I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.440" end="00:43:03.869" style="s2">be marketing I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.809" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">want any spirit of marketing to to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.869" end="00:43:12.510" style="s2">infect a conversation with somebody i I</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:16.019" style="s2">want to throw this whole you know game</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.510" end="00:43:19.799" style="s2">sort of you know overboard right to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.019" end="00:43:21.809" style="s2">right to the essential yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.799" end="00:43:23.880" style="s2">totally so like you don&#39;t need any</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.809" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">effects you don&#39;t need it I got a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.880" end="00:43:27.779" style="s2">bit of music at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:29.789" style="s2">podcast but I make it very short and III</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.779" end="00:43:31.260" style="s2">don&#39;t need production I don&#39;t need any</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.789" end="00:43:34.470" style="s2">of these things I guess I get a bench</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.260" end="00:43:36.779" style="s2">eventually perhaps if if this takes off</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.470" end="00:43:40.049" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll have to think more about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.779" end="00:43:43.470" style="s2">those things but the raw the raw stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.049" end="00:43:45.690" style="s2">is always more interesting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.470" end="00:43:48.089" style="s2">like if we think about the raw stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.690" end="00:43:50.819" style="s2">you&#39;re making a distinction between like</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.089" end="00:43:53.160" style="s2">like oh yeah I don&#39;t want to do this one</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.819" end="00:43:53.730" style="s2">thing yeah and I do want to do this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.160" end="00:43:55.769" style="s2">other thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.730" end="00:43:59.910" style="s2">yeah this other thing I don&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.769" end="00:44:04.980" style="s2">what it is but this marketing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.910" end="00:44:09.240" style="s2">imagining is something like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.980" end="00:44:11.339" style="s2">to I don&#39;t want to like frame and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.240" end="00:44:14.029" style="s2">then tell you that I don&#39;t want to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.339" end="00:44:17.210" style="s2">that I&#39;m incapable of it of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.029" end="00:44:19.890" style="s2">the question comes up for me and that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.210" end="00:44:22.589" style="s2">what are you it what are you an</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.890" end="00:44:27.660" style="s2">allegiance to or that maybe it was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.589" end="00:44:29.759" style="s2">way when you looked at it he that which</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.660" end="00:44:32.460" style="s2">you&#39;re an allegiance to is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.759" end="00:44:35.039" style="s2">that you can&#39;t not be right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.460" end="00:44:39.089" style="s2">not break and what are you even</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.039" end="00:44:40.799" style="s2">allegiance to they just kind of I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.089" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">this is maybe related to that question</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.799" end="00:44:46.410" style="s2">about the divine double right yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:52.559" style="s2">an allegiance to the divine double yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.410" end="00:44:55.180" style="s2">indeed I would have to be because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.559" end="00:44:57.279" style="s2">would be too painful not to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.180" end="00:45:00.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not because I&#39;m not be cover</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.119" end="00:45:15.720" style="s2">way because it would be boring right</p>

<p begin="00:46:55.930" end="00:47:03.700" style="s2">chaos uh-huh yeah so I would think so</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.420" end="00:47:08.890" style="s2">there&#39;s something about like like for</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.700" end="00:47:14.410" style="s2">for for me I feel in Legion</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.890" end="00:47:19.420" style="s2">- that - that thing that I doesn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.410" end="00:47:20.980" style="s2">have a word yet for it right like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.420" end="00:47:22.980" style="s2">one of the things I&#39;ve liked I&#39;ve really</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.980" end="00:47:25.660" style="s2">liked about the practicing circling for</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:30.420" style="s2">like the last 20 years if I think about</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.660" end="00:47:33.250" style="s2">like the machinery it exercises is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.420" end="00:47:37.270" style="s2">listening to people like listening to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.250" end="00:47:40.120" style="s2">people like for just listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.270" end="00:47:42.010" style="s2">and what listening is is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.120" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">than just being quiet and paying</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.010" end="00:47:49.990" style="s2">attention right it&#39;s it doing that over</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">and over and over again I feel like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.990" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">feel more oriented to I think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:01.720" style="s2">revealing of that which I continually</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:04.150" style="s2">find myself an allegiance in which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.720" end="00:48:05.920" style="s2">something like that more nests or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.150" end="00:48:08.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like that sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.920" end="00:48:12.460" style="s2">inexhaustible intelligibility that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.590" end="00:48:14.740" style="s2">behind things that that&#39;s the body so</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.460" end="00:48:18.490" style="s2">it&#39;s just like whatever it is just just</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.740" end="00:48:22.180" style="s2">just having having your compass set to</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.490" end="00:48:23.800" style="s2">that right it&#39;s just gonna is just a it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.180" end="00:48:26.380" style="s2">just seems like if you just orient that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.800" end="00:48:28.540" style="s2">way of like okay I really want to like I</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.380" end="00:48:31.810" style="s2">want to get you at the deepest level I</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.540" end="00:48:36.190" style="s2">want to understand why you exist and how</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.810" end="00:48:39.340" style="s2">you exist and and those things have you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.190" end="00:48:40.810" style="s2">go very very deep and like concrete and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.340" end="00:48:44.260" style="s2">right here right now but they</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.810" end="00:48:49.240" style="s2">simultaneously like have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.260" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">deep primordial transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.240" end="00:48:54.790" style="s2">contextual disclosures of the holes</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:56.710" style="s2">right I mean that&#39;s what a human being</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.790" end="00:48:59.980" style="s2">is in the moment what the hell else is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.710" end="00:49:04.420" style="s2">it but like an awkward coming together</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.980" end="00:49:06.010" style="s2">of of infinity and finitude it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.420" end="00:49:07.780" style="s2">that&#39;s the human face</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.010" end="00:49:09.820" style="s2">that&#39;s probably why when somebody walks</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.780" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">into a room we&#39;re like it changes the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.820" end="00:49:18.369" style="s2">whole moment right like if like it or</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.930" end="00:49:48.600" style="s2">constituting this moment are these are</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.630" end="00:49:52.030" style="s2">these these this recognition of one time</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.600" end="00:49:54.520" style="s2">right temper ality but also this sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.030" end="00:49:56.410" style="s2">of like when were when we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.520" end="00:49:59.500" style="s2">presence of another human being it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.410" end="00:50:02.980" style="s2">just like another object it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.500" end="00:50:06.190" style="s2">completely it changes the texture of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.980" end="00:50:07.840" style="s2">meaning of the moment right if you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.190" end="00:50:12.490" style="s2">them if you don&#39;t know them it&#39;s a cut</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.840" end="00:50:14.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like hmm so so you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.490" end="00:50:16.930" style="s2">pure meaning when you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.130" end="00:50:19.660" style="s2">another human being and if then you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.930" end="00:50:20.680" style="s2">look at what what is meaning so looks</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.660" end="00:50:23.109" style="s2">like everything is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.680" end="00:50:25.810" style="s2">like when I really got this when I was</p>

<p begin="00:50:41.560" end="00:50:45.940" style="s2">stuff like that so we were constantly</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.880" end="00:50:49.150" style="s2">drawing nude models and and to hear him</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.940" end="00:50:51.070" style="s2">talk about it&#39;s really fun when he would</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.150" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">do his critiques because to hear him</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.070" end="00:50:58.630" style="s2">talk about like what it was to render a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:51:02.460" style="s2">human being he&#39;s he would say that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.630" end="00:51:02.460" style="s2">know it&#39;s weird you can get away with</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:11.350" style="s2">like drawing an animal you know in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.390" end="00:51:14.650" style="s2">that you can&#39;t get away with in drawing</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.350" end="00:51:16.830" style="s2">a human being and he says because every</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.650" end="00:51:20.680" style="s2">single part of the human being is</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.830" end="00:51:23.080" style="s2">dynamic and expressive and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.680" end="00:51:27.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve come to understand that is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.080" end="00:51:30.550" style="s2">there&#39;s not one inch of the figure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.670" end="00:51:32.970" style="s2">doesn&#39;t communicate a world mmm right</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.550" end="00:51:37.240" style="s2">there&#39;s not one part of it that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.970" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">express right a whole culture a whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.240" end="00:51:45.570" style="s2">world a whole lifetime a whole future</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:47.800" style="s2">ever so if you if you render it either</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.570" end="00:51:49.740" style="s2">realistically or abstractly in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.800" end="00:51:53.800" style="s2">that like if any part of it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.740" end="00:51:56.470" style="s2">speak or say it&#39;s it somehow doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.800" end="00:52:00.600" style="s2">really show its humanity it doesn&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.470" end="00:52:03.970" style="s2">its figurative this mmm and I just I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.600" end="00:52:06.190" style="s2">wanted that maybe think of us that when</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.970" end="00:52:08.260" style="s2">you try to create the whole of a person</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.190" end="00:52:11.770" style="s2">if you are sketching them or drawing</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.260" end="00:52:15.010" style="s2">them you could only do that if it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.770" end="00:52:16.750" style="s2">incomplete like the human being is</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.010" end="00:52:19.300" style="s2">incomplete right whereas the animal</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.750" end="00:52:20.350" style="s2">would be complete already right as if</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.300" end="00:52:24.550" style="s2">you&#39;re drawing a human being you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.350" end="00:52:27.400" style="s2">drawing something incomplete right yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.550" end="00:52:32.590" style="s2">yes it&#39;s like you&#39;re drawing a being</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.400" end="00:52:35.800" style="s2">that every part of its being is given by</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.490" end="01:00:19.749" style="s2">he had this way of writing and I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.140" end="01:00:23.589" style="s2">like wow I saw I thought I was talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.749" end="01:00:26.740" style="s2">to Herman Melville or or or Henry James</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.890" end="01:00:58.779" style="s2">enriched in his presence and in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:01:00.819" style="s2">discussion and and that&#39;s where I want</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.940" end="01:02:03.720" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s a poet on some level like and</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.540" end="01:02:05.610" style="s2">so that that&#39;s easily it&#39;s rare to meet</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.720" end="01:02:07.410" style="s2">a poet I would say and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.610" end="01:02:10.530" style="s2">especially now because people don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.410" end="01:02:12.150" style="s2">about poetry you know and most poetry</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.530" end="01:02:14.520" style="s2">has just swallowed up by it by the</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.150" end="01:02:20.400" style="s2">Machine right right by that by the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.520" end="01:02:22.860" style="s2">endless discussions and yes there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.400" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">way where he just dwells there like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.860" end="01:02:31.080" style="s2">way man the way that language loves him</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:33.030" style="s2">right and it habit is just so when it</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.080" end="01:02:37.020" style="s2">cuz when he talks he just gathers like</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.030" end="01:02:40.170" style="s2">he he you can literally watch him speak</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.020" end="01:02:44.330" style="s2">and you he&#39;s he has a wrestling match</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.170" end="01:02:48.090" style="s2">that somehow comes out like you get the</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.330" end="01:02:49.530" style="s2">woven tapestry of a wrestling match or</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.090" end="01:02:52.080" style="s2">just something like where he&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.530" end="01:02:54.840" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like the idea bucks of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.080" end="01:02:58.020" style="s2">intelligibility and he weaves these two</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.840" end="01:03:00.180" style="s2">things of like the deft hand and right</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.020" end="01:03:02.250" style="s2">that which be holds is that which was</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.180" end="01:03:04.560" style="s2">beholden and he just there&#39;s this world</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.250" end="01:03:05.940" style="s2">coming on and there&#39;s a way which I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.560" end="01:03:08.250" style="s2">Gurley get with him there&#39;s a ton</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.940" end="01:03:11.640" style="s2">there&#39;s it and he&#39;s so young at the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.250" end="01:03:14.100" style="s2">time which is so odd yeah odd to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.640" end="01:03:20.820" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s thirty years old who has</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.100" end="01:03:23.610" style="s2">that kind of ability to speak I guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.820" end="01:03:25.800" style="s2">just speak words you know in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.610" end="01:03:29.220" style="s2">feelings you did you notice that feel</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.800" end="01:03:31.050" style="s2">like for me it&#39;s like I there&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.220" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">almost like in a way that would as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.050" end="01:03:36.570" style="s2">talking with hit up talking about Chris</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:39.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which I feel we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.570" end="01:03:45.060" style="s2">evoke to spirit of some kind I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.480" end="01:03:47.400" style="s2">a context in his in a in a room of some</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.060" end="01:03:51.330" style="s2">kind or a different space and just a</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.400" end="01:03:52.930" style="s2">bulking his name and I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.330" end="01:03:56.470" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.930" end="01:04:00.819" style="s2">but I think what I feel it evoked by</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.470" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">right and invoked into it is I would</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.819" end="01:04:05.410" style="s2">imagine would be something like that</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:07.990" style="s2">whatever it is that calls Chris into</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.410" end="01:04:09.609" style="s2">being like I&#39;m wondering about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.990" end="01:04:11.109" style="s2">another thing about the text I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.609" end="01:04:14.440" style="s2">trying to get this notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.109" end="01:04:16.089" style="s2">double right yeah like one of your</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.440" end="01:04:18.249" style="s2">questions was what is your divine double</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.089" end="01:04:20.499" style="s2">ask like man it just seems like whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.249" end="01:04:22.660" style="s2">if I could answer that question it</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.499" end="01:04:25.960" style="s2">probably isn&#39;t it probably isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.660" end="01:04:27.849" style="s2">there&#39;s this this mmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.960" end="01:04:30.190" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s beyond the horizon</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.849" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">right I thought of the quote by Rilke</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.190" end="01:04:32.829" style="s2">you know he says every angel is</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:35.799" style="s2">terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.829" end="01:04:38.829" style="s2">yeah nuts that&#39;s right divine double and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.799" end="01:04:40.749" style="s2">so when some yes which can&#39;t be defined</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.829" end="01:04:43.569" style="s2">and it also destroys us in that in some</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.749" end="01:04:47.319" style="s2">sense and it does a currently disdains</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.569" end="01:04:53.140" style="s2">to annihilate it strains to annihilate</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.319" end="01:04:54.789" style="s2">us exactly yeah oka is pretty so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.140" end="01:04:57.400" style="s2">like there&#39;s something about I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.789" end="01:04:59.680" style="s2">this is this is part of the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.400" end="01:05:01.210" style="s2">Chris is what do you folks and me and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.680" end="01:05:06.549" style="s2">sounds like very something very similar</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.210" end="01:05:08.739" style="s2">for you is is he he evokes whatever it</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.549" end="01:05:11.049" style="s2">is that calls him to language it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.739" end="01:05:12.519" style="s2">it but it goes beyond Chris right</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.049" end="01:05:16.749" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality of that there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.519" end="01:05:20.140" style="s2">something really transcendent in just a</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.749" end="01:05:22.420" style="s2">voguing his name he&#39;s transparent to</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.140" end="01:05:25.630" style="s2">something hmm</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.420" end="01:05:29.349" style="s2">that his language calls in and comes</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.630" end="01:05:31.960" style="s2">from mom I so I just end up really just</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.349" end="01:05:35.999" style="s2">like I really like him I just really</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.960" end="01:05:38.829" style="s2">like that guy a lot he&#39;s such a such a</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.999" end="01:05:43.150" style="s2">well I guess that&#39;s the thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.829" end="01:05:46.779" style="s2">likable is allowing yourself to be open</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.150" end="01:05:49.359" style="s2">to that transparency yeah which makes</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.779" end="01:05:51.640" style="s2">somebody it makes you feel like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.359" end="01:05:56.619" style="s2">talking to somebody who&#39;s not a persona</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.640" end="01:05:58.920" style="s2">who&#39;s not a mask who&#39;s not a it was not</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.619" end="01:06:01.930" style="s2">mechanical in this his way of being</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.920" end="01:06:05.220" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s like he was like I guess</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.930" end="01:06:05.220" style="s2">opened up to that</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.260" end="01:06:15.000" style="s2">Oh on some level yeah me almost and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.300" end="01:06:17.530" style="s2">think to share in the way that he does I</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.000" end="01:06:22.440" style="s2">think one of the things maybe that gets</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.530" end="01:06:22.440" style="s2">communicated for me in that sharing is</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.970" end="01:06:28.990" style="s2">there something Trent yeah there is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.260" end="01:06:33.430" style="s2">quality when he speaks so lyrically and</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.990" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">poetically and espouses in this way and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.430" end="01:06:39.040" style="s2">how it is like rolls off of him that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:41.470" style="s2">there is there is a way in which he</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.040" end="01:06:43.750" style="s2">because he talks about Simba symbolism a</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.470" end="01:06:46.750" style="s2">lot about you know in the way the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.750" end="01:06:48.900" style="s2">Tillich does um where a symbol is</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.750" end="01:06:51.670" style="s2">transparent you look through a simple</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.900" end="01:06:54.250" style="s2">right it&#39;s like the symbols like speaks</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.670" end="01:06:56.560" style="s2">to what&#39;s beyond itself in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.250" end="01:07:00.790" style="s2">embodies it but beyond it so you</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.560" end="01:07:03.670" style="s2">actually live a symbol you enact a</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.790" end="01:07:07.600" style="s2">simple right and as well it&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.670" end="01:07:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not opaque and so when you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.600" end="01:07:13.660" style="s2">like like Chris is speaking symbology</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.800" end="01:07:16.180" style="s2">right but he&#39;s pointing to whatever</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.660" end="01:07:17.850" style="s2">symbol it is that would speak symbology</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.180" end="01:07:23.530" style="s2">at the same time and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.850" end="01:07:26.140" style="s2">reverent saying that that his feels</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.530" end="01:07:29.290" style="s2">fills you up and I&#39;ve noticed that with</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.140" end="01:07:33.010" style="s2">Kristen with people like Chris hmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.290" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s something evocative yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.010" end="01:07:38.170" style="s2">he&#39;s evocative that&#39;s interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:39.580" style="s2">word you Bob I know I am non contrasting</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.170" end="01:07:41.140" style="s2">him to other people who have another</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.580" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">kind of quality which might be more</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.570" end="01:10:29.460" style="s2">necessarily to having faith I live in it</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.690" end="01:10:31.860" style="s2">and so as we talked about and I see it</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.460" end="01:10:33.510" style="s2">I&#39;m like oh yeah I bet on some level</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.860" end="01:10:36.930" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about is like something</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.510" end="01:10:38.880" style="s2">about the the authenticity of these</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.930" end="01:10:43.170" style="s2">dialogues and what what we&#39;re all up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.880" end="01:10:45.480" style="s2">and how much I would have faith that</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.170" end="01:10:48.540" style="s2">there is that I was like so I guess</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.480" end="01:10:51.000" style="s2">sincerity is very powerful isn&#39;t it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.540" end="01:10:53.750" style="s2">you know sincerity is almost something</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.000" end="01:10:58.290" style="s2">that the cuts through all that</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.750" end="01:11:01.770" style="s2">which which but it&#39;s even more than that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.290" end="01:11:05.790" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I guess I&#39;m coming back</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.770" end="01:11:07.260" style="s2">to it&#39;s just revealing what&#39;s true more</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.790" end="01:11:08.970" style="s2">and more revelation more and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.260" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">consciousness I guess are more and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.970" end="01:11:16.020" style="s2">like just even if it&#39;s just a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:19.350" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s making making the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.020" end="01:11:21.060" style="s2">world alive again I guess yes as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.350" end="01:11:25.200" style="s2">walking through the this field of</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.060" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">corpses you know yes totally and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.200" end="01:11:31.860" style="s2">and it&#39;s doing it in such a way that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:34.890" style="s2">it&#39;s actually okay here vocally like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.860" end="01:11:36.720" style="s2">Vulcan Heidegger right the and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.890" end="01:11:38.640" style="s2">Greeks and the pre-socratics right which</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.720" end="01:11:43.500" style="s2">is this kind of notion the original</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.640" end="01:11:45.840" style="s2">notion of truth which yeah yeah look</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.500" end="01:11:47.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard it enough said I probably</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.840" end="01:11:51.540" style="s2">pronounced it wrong cuz I just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.600" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">heard people say Alethea okay yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.540" end="01:12:00.240" style="s2">all right just to give some context for</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:12:03.390" style="s2">that I my understanding is so so that</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.240" end="01:12:05.370" style="s2">ley Thea was a river or sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.390" end="01:12:08.010" style="s2">also portrayed as a lake in green</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.370" end="01:12:10.680" style="s2">pathology right in the river or a lake</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.010" end="01:12:11.940" style="s2">of forgetfulness which is really</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.680" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">interesting when you think about this</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.940" end="01:12:17.370" style="s2">because I realized I didn&#39;t really quite</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:21.030" style="s2">croc Alethea for years and I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.370" end="01:12:23.130" style="s2">did which is very Alethea in this way</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.030" end="01:12:24.750" style="s2">but so it&#39;s like it&#39;d be something like</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.130" end="01:12:26.790" style="s2">if you were to if if you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.750" end="01:12:28.449" style="s2">along with guys walking along any trips</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.790" end="01:12:30.999" style="s2">and falls and he falls in and lay</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.449" end="01:12:32.920" style="s2">Alethea mm-hmm it&#39;s not like people are</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.999" end="01:12:35.320" style="s2">like wake up in the morning and they</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.920" end="01:12:40.239" style="s2">don&#39;t find guy but they&#39;re like where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.320" end="01:12:43.570" style="s2">guy no he&#39;s completely forgotten it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.239" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">it&#39;s it it&#39;s it&#39;s missing the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.570" end="01:12:49.329" style="s2">missing right like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.519" style="s2">missing that he&#39;s missing so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.329" end="01:12:55.119" style="s2">even it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.519" end="01:12:57.059" style="s2">concealed so if you think about ah lay</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.119" end="01:13:01.479" style="s2">theá-- the truth is concealed you mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.059" end="01:13:05.289" style="s2">yeah yeah and well the truth is when it</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.479" end="01:13:11.159" style="s2">goes Alethea so it&#39;s the the AH</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.289" end="01:13:14.499" style="s2">is the event right that&#39;s the first time</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.159" end="01:13:17.260" style="s2">right of that which is veiled or</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.499" end="01:13:20.199" style="s2">concealed is the moment that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.260" end="01:13:24.010" style="s2">concealed it&#39;s concealed this becomes</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.199" end="01:13:24.999" style="s2">unconcealed uh-huh so that&#39;s so right</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.010" end="01:13:30.130" style="s2">there that was a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.999" end="01:13:32.610" style="s2">AHA yeah oh oh oh that&#39;s right that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.130" end="01:13:35.619" style="s2">could say that that is a local</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.610" end="01:13:36.849" style="s2">manifestation of things reveal ah in</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.619" end="01:13:39.670" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting is it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.849" end="01:13:44.429" style="s2">it isn&#39;t cognitive necessarily know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.670" end="01:13:48.909" style="s2">bottom up right whose bottom up that</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.429" end="01:13:51.880" style="s2">experience of revelation right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.909" end="01:13:56.349" style="s2">what&#39;s drawing us back for for the taste</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.880" end="01:13:58.929" style="s2">of life there each time yeah mmm so</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.349" end="01:14:00.849" style="s2">there&#39;s this quality for me and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.929" end="01:14:04.749" style="s2">thought for years I always thought that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.849" end="01:14:08.429" style="s2">was that what what the truth was was</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.749" end="01:14:11.409" style="s2">what was revealed right the Alethea like</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.429" end="01:14:14.469" style="s2">it&#39;s not on what though I get it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.409" end="01:14:16.150" style="s2">like what yeah there&#39;s like the work yes</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.469" end="01:14:18.309" style="s2">the the what is something like the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.150" end="01:14:20.829" style="s2">proposition right it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.309" end="01:14:23.289" style="s2">that so it&#39;s not like oh I just found</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.829" end="01:14:23.709" style="s2">the Holy Grail here&#39;s the Holy Grail all</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.289" end="01:14:25.869" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.709" end="01:14:28.269" style="s2">more like you you found something that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.869" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">something that is unfolding into</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.269" end="01:14:34.420" style="s2">something else and yeah it&#39;s process it</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:36.570" style="s2">sort of endless process yes and I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.420" end="01:14:38.700" style="s2">what unfolds</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.570" end="01:14:43.080" style="s2">because of what I think that what what</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.700" end="01:14:46.530" style="s2">Heidegger was was reeling was</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.080" end="01:14:48.930" style="s2">remembering and going back and in into</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.530" end="01:14:51.330" style="s2">the the notion of truth and Alethea I</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.930" end="01:14:54.090" style="s2">think what he was pointing out was</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.330" end="01:14:55.950" style="s2">something that that got lost and I which</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.090" end="01:14:57.900" style="s2">is what Heidegger I think kind of does</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.950" end="01:15:01.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s so cool about reading</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.900" end="01:15:04.080" style="s2">him is that you walk back into these</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.680" end="01:15:06.150" style="s2">places and it&#39;s a complete to do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.080" end="01:15:07.830" style="s2">even if you don&#39;t understand what the</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.150" end="01:15:10.440" style="s2">hell he&#39;s talking about just the attempt</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.830" end="01:15:14.810" style="s2">to as you do these acrobats that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.440" end="01:15:18.450" style="s2">fists like my to be deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.810" end="01:15:22.350" style="s2">evoking and transformative almost yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.450" end="01:15:24.600" style="s2">and Alethea I started to realize that I</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.350" end="01:15:25.230" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s it&#39;s about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.600" end="01:15:27.480" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.230" end="01:15:30.690" style="s2">I think what&#39;s actually the real thing</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.480" end="01:15:34.650" style="s2">that got unconcealed is concealment</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.690" end="01:15:38.730" style="s2">itself is the is the revelation of that</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.650" end="01:15:42.060" style="s2">being right for being to be disclosed is</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.730" end="01:15:45.660" style="s2">it is it reveals that it was disclosed</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.060" end="01:15:48.030" style="s2">that its nature is concealment that when</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.660" end="01:15:52.110" style="s2">it reveals itself what it reveals is</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.030" end="01:15:54.330" style="s2">that there is concealment and that being</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.110" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">is that thing which you can never become</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.330" end="01:16:03.510" style="s2">completely CLE clear about the vision</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:07.560" style="s2">itself health quality hey maybe being is</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.510" end="01:16:12.750" style="s2">the last concealment yeah yes and like</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.560" end="01:16:14.880" style="s2">in revealing it right it it reveals and</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.750" end="01:16:17.460" style="s2">in a certain sense conceals its</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.880" end="01:16:21.300" style="s2">revealing right kind of like light like</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.460" end="01:16:25.680" style="s2">light lights of everything but yet it it</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.300" end="01:16:28.680" style="s2">withdrawals in its disclosure right so</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.680" end="01:16:31.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like and win it withdrawals it does</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.680" end="01:16:34.470" style="s2">something that animates everything that</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.470" end="01:16:37.020" style="s2">we are and the thing about it so so like</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.470" end="01:16:38.520" style="s2">like a good example of this would be see</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.020" end="01:16:42.340" style="s2">it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like you can like these</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.520" end="01:16:44.409" style="s2">are the things that I I eat</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.340" end="01:16:45.730" style="s2">this is kind of very ilithyia Nazz I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.409" end="01:16:47.469" style="s2">talking about it because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.730" end="01:16:50.199" style="s2">talking but I&#39;ve been grappling with</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.469" end="01:16:51.610" style="s2">ilithyia my whole life but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.199" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">this experience of like if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.610" end="01:16:56.139" style="s2">because it&#39;s a genuine idea isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:16:58.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a genuine idea because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.139" end="01:17:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no end to what it can reveal</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.150" end="01:17:03.130" style="s2">about itself yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.520" end="01:17:07.030" style="s2">so to just sort of get close to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.130" end="01:17:08.710" style="s2">like it is intimate like I&#39;m like I I</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.030" end="01:17:11.619" style="s2">probably said this over and over again</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.710" end="01:17:13.540" style="s2">but what has me say it is that I feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.619" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">like the more the closer I get to it the</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.540" end="01:17:21.909" style="s2">more withdrawals and reveals at the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:24.190" style="s2">time it&#39;s very much pregnant with what</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.909" end="01:17:27.460" style="s2">it is but it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.190" end="01:17:29.400" style="s2">the movie that exemplifies this is is</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.460" end="01:17:31.540" style="s2">the is the movie The Sixth Sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.400" end="01:17:33.760" style="s2">remember that movie with the Bruce</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.540" end="01:17:36.610" style="s2">Willis yeah it wasn&#39;t he wasn&#39;t he was</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.760" end="01:17:39.460" style="s2">dead yeah I see what you mean yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.610" end="01:17:41.230" style="s2">he was dead the whole time right and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.460" end="01:17:42.730" style="s2">you&#39;re watching the movie and he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.230" end="01:17:45.250" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t know it right</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.730" end="01:17:46.929" style="s2">yeah and in none of the audience knows</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.250" end="01:17:48.310" style="s2">it either so we&#39;re all like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.929" end="01:17:50.679" style="s2">kind of weird something&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.310" end="01:17:52.270" style="s2">strange or something there anything in</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.679" end="01:17:54.159" style="s2">the movie I don&#39;t remember exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.270" end="01:17:57.219" style="s2">happens but somehow like out of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.159" end="01:18:01.000" style="s2">corner of his eye he kind of starts to</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.219" end="01:18:04.179" style="s2">get and then as he gets the whole</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.000" end="01:18:07.360" style="s2">audience gets if there&#39;s this moment of</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.179" end="01:18:11.619" style="s2">Alethea it starts to become revealed</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.360" end="01:18:13.449" style="s2">he&#39;s dead and like and as it&#39;s revealed</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.619" end="01:18:15.550" style="s2">he can kind of feel it go through the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.449" end="01:18:19.650" style="s2">movie theater write this revelation he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.550" end="01:18:22.750" style="s2">like oh my god him I&#39;m dead and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.650" end="01:18:25.570" style="s2">like a moment later once that</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.750" end="01:18:27.310" style="s2">recognition the revealing comes in then</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.570" end="01:18:30.010" style="s2">it goes back to the very beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.310" end="01:18:32.170" style="s2">the movie and if it flashes these like</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.010" end="01:18:36.219" style="s2">the main frames of everything that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.170" end="01:18:38.920" style="s2">just had watched and you can you can you</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.219" end="01:18:42.849" style="s2">see that it was obvious the whole time</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.920" end="01:18:45.820" style="s2">yeah right hmm there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.849" end="01:18:48.849" style="s2">that like that revelation of concealment</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.820" end="01:18:53.320" style="s2">in it&#39;s obvious &#39;no sin its nearness</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.849" end="01:18:54.199" style="s2">right so i think i think one of the good</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.320" end="01:18:56.809" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.199" end="01:18:58.999" style="s2">like wonder what we what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.809" end="01:19:02.030" style="s2">what draws on this good faith in these</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.999" end="01:19:04.849" style="s2">conversations right is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.030" end="01:19:08.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a thick we&#39;re all oriented</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.849" end="01:19:12.409" style="s2">towards truth but in this Alethea sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.539" end="01:19:17.570" style="s2">that that that that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.409" end="01:19:21.050" style="s2">implicit understanding or quality that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.570" end="01:19:22.729" style="s2">we embody right in our search which is</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.050" end="01:19:25.999" style="s2">the sense of like that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.729" end="01:19:28.369" style="s2">that were it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.999" end="01:19:30.979" style="s2">dominate or get clear about something</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.369" end="01:19:35.090" style="s2">it&#39;s more like looking and loving truth</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.979" end="01:19:37.729" style="s2">and to look for truth is to look towards</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.090" end="01:19:40.429" style="s2">concealment right so to be oriented</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.729" end="01:19:44.329" style="s2">towards that which is is yet unveiled I</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.429" end="01:19:46.369" style="s2">mean I think I think that&#39;s why a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.329" end="01:19:48.829" style="s2">the conversation is about the times that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.369" end="01:19:52.909" style="s2">we live in and as I think as Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.829" end="01:19:57.050" style="s2">would say is is is is that the time that</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.909" end="01:19:59.119" style="s2">we&#39;re living the techno framing age of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.050" end="01:20:00.949" style="s2">technology that were in is this not</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.119" end="01:20:04.610" style="s2">technological devices and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.949" end="01:20:08.179" style="s2">technology itself it&#39;s the UH the way of</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.610" end="01:20:10.070" style="s2">understanding everything at everything</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.179" end="01:20:13.400" style="s2">that&#39;s anything at all by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.070" end="01:20:17.530" style="s2">which we understand it as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.400" end="01:20:22.070" style="s2">standing in reserved fully available</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.530" end="01:20:25.219" style="s2">right you optimized to be extracted to</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.070" end="01:20:26.599" style="s2">be ordered to function the death that</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.219" end="01:20:29.510" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about it annoying yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.599" end="01:20:32.389" style="s2">yes and what it conceals and what he</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.510" end="01:20:34.190" style="s2">would say is the danger and he also said</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.389" end="01:20:36.889" style="s2">this is the saving power within the</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.190" end="01:20:41.809" style="s2">danger is the same a bonus holder in</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.889" end="01:20:44.300" style="s2">there right is is is is the danger is</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.809" end="01:20:46.400" style="s2">that this is what demarcates this</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.300" end="01:20:48.349" style="s2">understanding of everything that is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.400" end="01:20:52.729" style="s2">understanding of being of our time is</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.349" end="01:20:55.249" style="s2">that it is what it what it what it</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.729" end="01:20:59.780" style="s2">conceals is that there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.249" end="01:21:02.829" style="s2">concealed right okay optimizes so</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.780" end="01:21:05.809" style="s2">everything&#39;s available everything is</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.829" end="01:21:07.610" style="s2">including ourselves we are now part of</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.809" end="01:21:09.110" style="s2">the standing reserve and</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.610" end="01:21:10.909" style="s2">which if you just look at our attitudes</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.110" end="01:21:12.380" style="s2">about ourselves is like we look at her</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.909" end="01:21:15.820" style="s2">bodies like it&#39;s something dislike look</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.380" end="01:21:19.550" style="s2">let&#39;s hack the out of this thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.820" end="01:21:22.550" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s extract all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.550" end="01:21:24.469" style="s2">and make and release all the potential</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.550" end="01:21:29.210" style="s2">out of ourselves so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.469" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">harnessed it and order it and that is so</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.210" end="01:21:41.300" style="s2">deep in it&#39;s both outside and it&#39;s him</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:43.719" style="s2">and I think what what Verve a key is is</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.300" end="01:21:48.980" style="s2">talking about with the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.719" end="01:21:53.449" style="s2">what Jordan Hall his determination is</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.980" end="01:21:56.989" style="s2">sense of like deep urgency right called</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.449" end="01:21:59.119" style="s2">like fierce urgency and like system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.989" end="01:22:01.850" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s all on some level it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.119" end="01:22:05.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s through harkening this sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.850" end="01:22:09.920" style="s2">of the concealment of all that is right</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.960" end="01:22:12.080" style="s2">then get fullness of me right and in</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.920" end="01:22:14.630" style="s2">that and that I think this is what</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.080" end="01:22:18.199" style="s2">really Heidegger brings to for that I</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.630" end="01:22:21.020" style="s2">really resonate with which is like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.199" end="01:22:24.980" style="s2">in a time we&#39;re being is present in its</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.020" end="01:22:28.159" style="s2">complete withdrawal and that so if you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.980" end="01:22:31.909" style="s2">want to read if you want to reveal like</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.159" end="01:22:33.699" style="s2">being notice like look at where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.909" end="01:22:36.469" style="s2">withdrawing because that&#39;s where it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.699" end="01:22:40.670" style="s2">Jack Stein was saying in alchemy or</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.469" end="01:22:42.530" style="s2">something is it is that you have to look</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.670" end="01:22:46.760" style="s2">at the Putra fication or you have to</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.530" end="01:22:50.239" style="s2">look at that at the at the image of you</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.760" end="01:22:51.800" style="s2">know the most the Sun you have to look</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.239" end="01:22:54.409" style="s2">where it where it&#39;s impossible to look</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.800" end="01:22:56.480" style="s2">where you you cannot look because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.409" end="01:22:59.119" style="s2">too much of it&#39;s just shocking it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.480" end="01:23:03.790" style="s2">terrible it&#39;s too yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.119" end="01:23:06.710" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s too it&#39;s too you know you</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.790" end="01:23:09.830" style="s2">could almost use the word evil for it or</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.710" end="01:23:14.840" style="s2">something you know this dehumanizing</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.830" end="01:23:17.030" style="s2">force yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely and</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.840" end="01:23:18.739" style="s2">and that&#39;s the question I think that</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.030" end="01:23:21.130" style="s2">we&#39;re on some level whether or not we</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.739" end="01:23:24.250" style="s2">can conceptualize it or</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.130" end="01:23:27.550" style="s2">like like there&#39;s a I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.250" end="01:23:29.679" style="s2">thing that is gathering this we that we</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.550" end="01:23:32.739" style="s2">can somehow call a we this corner of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.679" end="01:23:36.280" style="s2">universe is it&#39;s like real orientation</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.739" end="01:23:38.350" style="s2">to listening right to that which is no</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.280" end="01:23:42.159" style="s2">longer calling like we can hear that</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.350" end="01:23:44.139" style="s2">that did objects and people in our lives</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.159" end="01:23:46.389" style="s2">and the structures of institution that</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.139" end="01:23:49.659" style="s2">they they&#39;re no longer things don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.389" end="01:23:53.050" style="s2">any sense to them they like hmm they</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.659" end="01:23:55.030" style="s2">don&#39;t have and sense right and and I</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.050" end="01:23:57.880" style="s2">think this is I think that a lot of a</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.030" end="01:23:59.639" style="s2">lot of the symptoms symptoms is why</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.880" end="01:24:02.830" style="s2">we&#39;re like people are getting so</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.639" end="01:24:05.620" style="s2">moralistic because on some level they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.830" end="01:24:07.690" style="s2">trying to bring sense into this</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.620" end="01:24:12.159" style="s2">deprecation of things not making any</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.690" end="01:24:14.800" style="s2">sense morality then we get shallow</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.159" end="01:24:18.790" style="s2">morality instead of genuine ethics or</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.800" end="01:24:20.739" style="s2">genuine action or or you know yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.790" end="01:24:22.540" style="s2">schools make you stupid the money makes</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.739" end="01:24:26.889" style="s2">you poor and medicine makes you sick</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.540" end="01:24:30.280" style="s2">that was a quote that grades aqueduct</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.889" end="01:24:33.070" style="s2">was a quest a yeah so it&#39;s weird so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.280" end="01:24:34.929" style="s2">like while so people are so for example</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.070" end="01:24:37.630" style="s2">I&#39;m you can see that the the you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.929" end="01:24:40.320" style="s2">people&#39;s moralistic responses to things</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.630" end="01:24:44.040" style="s2">that cannot be penetrated by any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.320" end="01:24:47.110" style="s2">rationality or reason right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.040" end="01:24:50.010" style="s2">they just go is that where religio comes</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.110" end="01:24:54.340" style="s2">in to use to use John&#39;s phrase or or</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.010" end="01:24:56.110" style="s2">religion because mmm-hmm all you have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.340" end="01:25:00.070" style="s2">shallow morality if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.110" end="01:25:02.050" style="s2">deep religio I think yeah it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.070" end="01:25:05.170" style="s2">the things I think that implicitly is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.050" end="01:25:09.760" style="s2">vocht in relationship right which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.170" end="01:25:11.170" style="s2">basically religio I think my I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.760" end="01:25:13.090" style="s2">know if I understand it completely but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.170" end="01:25:18.120" style="s2">think I think what that highlights is</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.090" end="01:25:22.060" style="s2">the enactment of the religion its thee</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.120" end="01:25:22.929" style="s2">so so date you familiar with David</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.060" end="01:25:26.860" style="s2">Bentley Hart</p>

<p begin="01:25:26.860" end="01:25:33.760" style="s2">people really irritated by him but I</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.949" end="01:25:34.510" style="s2">think he&#39;s this really funny and he&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.760" end="01:25:38.020" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.510" end="01:25:40.270" style="s2">smart like the guy is just he&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.020" end="01:25:41.830" style="s2">really smart and he&#39;s very pompous I</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.270" end="01:25:43.480" style="s2">keep meaning to read his book actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.830" end="01:25:46.990" style="s2">because he says a lot of again yeah he</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.480" end="01:25:48.910" style="s2">has a sort of offensive yeah comes on in</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.990" end="01:25:51.670" style="s2">this offensive way but then he always</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.910" end="01:25:53.200" style="s2">says something that sticks with you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.670" end="01:25:55.440" style="s2">and he&#39;s he&#39;s white he&#39;s a modern</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.200" end="01:25:58.210" style="s2">theologian that actually grappled with</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.440" end="01:26:01.510" style="s2">continental philosophy which is not not</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.210" end="01:26:05.440" style="s2">that present in theologian so he&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.510" end="01:26:08.830" style="s2">very living about his thinking he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.440" end="01:26:10.840" style="s2">he like he&#39;s encountered Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.830" end="01:26:13.000" style="s2">wrestled with it and he&#39;s he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.840" end="01:26:15.940" style="s2">grappling with his it&#39;s alive and one of</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.000" end="01:26:19.170" style="s2">the things he said so a lot a lot of how</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.940" end="01:26:21.070" style="s2">he&#39;s become popular amongst you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.170" end="01:26:24.760" style="s2">non-academics is is through writing</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.070" end="01:26:28.930" style="s2">books in response to the to atheism to</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.760" end="01:26:30.340" style="s2">the you know the new yes ran and I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.930" end="01:26:35.080" style="s2">and I really kind of got this and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.340" end="01:26:37.660" style="s2">think this exemplifies religio when he</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.080" end="01:26:41.470" style="s2">was speaking to a claim by I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.660" end="01:26:43.060" style="s2">Dawkins is like well like how can you</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.470" end="01:26:45.460" style="s2">say that there&#39;s a God how can you prove</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.060" end="01:26:46.870" style="s2">it like put like how can you prove it</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.460" end="01:26:48.460" style="s2">like you know that that whole thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.870" end="01:26:51.190" style="s2">sure they&#39;re gonna be like well okay so</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.460" end="01:26:53.200" style="s2">if we were to run like well if we were</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.190" end="01:26:59.050" style="s2">to run an experiment what we would need</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.200" end="01:27:01.510" style="s2">to do mr. Dawkins is you need to like in</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.050" end="01:27:04.000" style="s2">the way that he&#39;s talking about God</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.510" end="01:27:05.740" style="s2">right the way that like a David Hart in</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.000" end="01:27:08.370" style="s2">the crook like the Christian at the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.740" end="01:27:11.500" style="s2">deepest sense of the word the theistic</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.370" end="01:27:12.970" style="s2">sensibility about God he&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.500" end="01:27:15.270" style="s2">what you would need to do is you would</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.970" end="01:27:19.120" style="s2">need to probably spend two three years</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.270" end="01:27:20.950" style="s2">going to church praying going in</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.120" end="01:27:24.760" style="s2">contemplative prayer doing</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.950" end="01:27:27.190" style="s2">Alecto Divina going through the rivers</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.760" end="01:27:29.470" style="s2">rights the ceremonies the confessions</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.190" end="01:27:33.040" style="s2">the he&#39;s like and then like two three</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.470" end="01:27:35.410" style="s2">years later right then we can take a</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.040" end="01:27:37.210" style="s2">look from that we could have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.410" end="01:27:39.550" style="s2">conversation about religion right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.210" end="01:27:42.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like like then then and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.550" end="01:27:44.470" style="s2">start to talk about the presence it the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.100" end="01:27:46.840" style="s2">proof of the presence of God and I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.470" end="01:27:48.010" style="s2">this is what I think verb a key i my</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.840" end="01:27:49.840" style="s2">understanding of her vague</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.010" end="01:27:52.690" style="s2">is when he&#39;s talking about participatory</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.840" end="01:27:54.820" style="s2">knowing that there&#39;s participatory</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.690" end="01:27:57.010" style="s2">knowing is part of what it&#39;s knowing</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.820" end="01:27:59.800" style="s2">through being presence and so the</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.010" end="01:28:04.090" style="s2">enactment of participating in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.800" end="01:28:07.329" style="s2">religion right is so intimately woven</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.090" end="01:28:09.250" style="s2">with God right so you can could just get</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.329" end="01:28:11.139" style="s2">the sense of like if Dawkins went did</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.250" end="01:28:12.610" style="s2">that for three years it&#39;s very feasible</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.139" end="01:28:15.369" style="s2">that he would come out at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.610" end="01:28:19.659" style="s2">that he&#39;d be like yeah whoa</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.369" end="01:28:21.880" style="s2">the presence of God right is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.659" end="01:28:25.420" style="s2">devote you can&#39;t uncollapse it from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.880" end="01:28:26.920" style="s2">the knowing of participation yeah and so</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.420" end="01:28:28.929" style="s2">I think we&#39;re baekje is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.920" end="01:28:32.860" style="s2">basically coming along with like religio</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.929" end="01:28:35.320" style="s2">is like well perhaps perhaps what we</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.860" end="01:28:37.800" style="s2">just need to do is not pretend like we</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.320" end="01:28:41.889" style="s2">can have a proposition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.800" end="01:28:44.050" style="s2">unscientific like lo let&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.889" end="01:28:46.480" style="s2">kiss you can&#39;t that&#39;s already happened</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.050" end="01:28:49.269" style="s2">we&#39;re so imbued with science and</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.480" end="01:28:51.610" style="s2">technology that we understand ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.269" end="01:28:55.179" style="s2">in it right you can&#39;t just decide not to</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.610" end="01:28:57.960" style="s2">be so I think what what what Verbeck</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.179" end="01:29:01.510" style="s2">he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s not trying to piss in</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.960" end="01:29:04.420" style="s2">the wind of history he&#39;s basically kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.510" end="01:29:06.340" style="s2">of really taking our fate and seeing and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.420" end="01:29:09.280" style="s2">this is what I think is the right way to</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.340" end="01:29:12.880" style="s2">respond to this age of technology is not</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.280" end="01:29:15.909" style="s2">not being again but like developing it</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.880" end="01:29:18.190" style="s2">beyond itself mmm I think I think I</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.909" end="01:29:20.260" style="s2">sense that sensibility in ver baekje and</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.190" end="01:29:24.190" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing is he&#39;s not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.260" end="01:29:27.730" style="s2">start a religion he&#39;s trying to disclose</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.190" end="01:29:30.070" style="s2">the the intelligibility of all those</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.730" end="01:29:33.099" style="s2">practices well actually that was Birds</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.070" end="01:29:35.980" style="s2">kind of criticism of him that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.099" end="01:29:38.829" style="s2">you you&#39;re actually what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.980" end="01:29:41.860" style="s2">about is religion you know yeah that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.829" end="01:29:43.719" style="s2">religion right the rest of it is the</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.860" end="01:29:46.929" style="s2">what your kritis what we&#39;re criticizing</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.719" end="01:29:50.860" style="s2">what Dawkins is criticizing you know is</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.929" end="01:29:53.769" style="s2">a dead religion you know so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.860" end="01:29:57.250" style="s2">have to believe in the God that Dawkins</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.769" end="01:29:58.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t believe in right either but</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.250" end="01:30:00.820" style="s2">there&#39;s something we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.900" end="01:30:03.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the fundamental sort</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.690" end="01:31:03.280" style="s2">be he&#39;s Nietzsche with the hammer</p>

<p begin="01:31:03.280" end="01:31:07.570" style="s2">hammer in the same and the way that John</p>

<p begin="01:31:07.570" end="01:31:13.210" style="s2">Socrates with the question you know Bart</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.560" end="01:31:16.030" style="s2">is Nietzsche with the hammer it&#39;s nice</p>

<p begin="01:31:19.630" end="01:31:23.890" style="s2">April yeah looking forward to that and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.270" end="01:31:26.950" style="s2">have a feeling that there is something</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.890" end="01:31:29.620" style="s2">paradoxical there yeah right cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.950" end="01:31:31.780" style="s2">like when he says so for example in in</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.620" end="01:31:33.880" style="s2">bards response to it he&#39;s like like no</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.780" end="01:31:36.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to get rid</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.880" end="01:31:40.750" style="s2">of the religion and like and do this</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.700" end="01:31:42.670" style="s2">kind of weird kind of emergent sense of</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.750" end="01:31:44.230" style="s2">you know you know he talks about when he</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.670" end="01:31:47.020" style="s2">starts breaking things apart right</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.230" end="01:31:49.570" style="s2">hitting with with the hammer actually I</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.020" end="01:31:53.770" style="s2">think when he says no we need to be more</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.570" end="01:31:55.960" style="s2">religious right to I sense an echo of</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.770" end="01:31:58.330" style="s2">that is I think that there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.960" end="01:31:59.770" style="s2">which they&#39;re actually I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.330" end="01:32:01.510" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about the same thing but</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.770" end="01:32:03.820" style="s2">I think they&#39;re talking about that which</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.510" end="01:32:06.010" style="s2">has multiple aspects to it</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.820" end="01:32:07.810" style="s2">mmm-hmm trait but there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.010" end="01:32:10.840" style="s2">there&#39;s something there wedded to and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.810" end="01:32:13.030" style="s2">have a feeling that see so the palace</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.840" end="01:32:15.070" style="s2">right and I don&#39;t know if I understand</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.030" end="01:32:17.290" style="s2">exactly what he means by that but I</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.070" end="01:32:19.630" style="s2">but based on what I do understand or my</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.290" end="01:32:22.840" style="s2">misunderstanding see it strikes me is</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.630" end="01:32:26.200" style="s2">like it it&#39;s actually very penetrating</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.840" end="01:32:30.090" style="s2">to like there&#39;s a penetration quality to</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.200" end="01:32:36.850" style="s2">it but the penetration right now is like</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.090" end="01:32:39.960" style="s2">if for example we can no longer have a</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.850" end="01:32:44.650" style="s2">proposition right that demarcates</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.960" end="01:32:47.800" style="s2">metaphysics right like that you just we</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.650" end="01:32:50.320" style="s2">can&#39;t we we can&#39;t make ourselves believe</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.800" end="01:32:54.070" style="s2">in that anymore like it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.320" end="01:32:56.320" style="s2">our fate we are in a new age right that</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.070" end="01:32:58.330" style="s2">even even deeply rather like that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.320" end="01:33:01.900" style="s2">we can make ourselves believe in that</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.330" end="01:33:04.680" style="s2">maybe maybe there&#39;s all kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.900" end="01:33:07.720" style="s2">that happen that we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.680" end="01:33:12.010" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.720" end="01:33:14.560" style="s2">well that thing that we we can believe</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.010" end="01:33:18.280" style="s2">in that we don&#39;t understand all right I</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.560" end="01:33:21.070" style="s2">think what I think what it&#39;s that right</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.280" end="01:33:24.430" style="s2">which is where the phallus needs to</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.070" end="01:33:28.030" style="s2">penetrate right mmm it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.430" end="01:33:31.810" style="s2">propose and make a claim right of like</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.030" end="01:33:34.900" style="s2">this is it right then you start to evoke</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.810" end="01:33:37.450" style="s2">all of the things that like</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.900" end="01:33:37.780" style="s2">historically have just made things go to</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.450" end="01:33:40.630" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:33:37.780" end="01:33:43.690" style="s2">right mm-hmm but I think the penetration</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.630" end="01:33:45.280" style="s2">is in is actually being able to stay</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.690" end="01:33:50.740" style="s2">with the mystery and reveal the</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.280" end="01:33:54.280" style="s2">ontological mystery with to that which</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.740" end="01:33:57.090" style="s2">cannot be proposed be housed in a</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.280" end="01:34:00.970" style="s2">proposition and that that actually</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.090" end="01:34:04.260" style="s2">besides that that is the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.970" end="01:34:04.260" style="s2">animates our lives</p>
