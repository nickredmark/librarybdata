<p begin="00:02:20.720" end="00:02:26.900" style="s2">by psychology I&#39;m very fond of saying</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.569" end="00:03:47.690" style="s2">for this peculiar phenomenon was because</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:51.169" style="s2">in times of uncertainty people tend to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.690" end="00:03:52.540" style="s2">save every penny and World War one was</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.470" end="00:04:21.009" style="s2">to catch up with the previous monetary</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.970" end="00:04:33.449" style="s2">by 1920 it was fluctuating between 1,000</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.990" end="00:07:28.789" style="s2">understanding velocity easy most</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.050" style="s2">economists make it sound really complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.789" end="00:07:32.090" style="s2">and people don&#39;t think they can</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.050" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">understand it but stick with me I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.090" end="00:07:37.729" style="s2">you&#39;ll enjoy this when you&#39;re measuring</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:40.069" style="s2">velocity you&#39;re measuring the number of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.729" end="00:07:42.889" style="s2">times each unit of currency changes</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.750" end="00:08:07.099" style="s2">his cab with gas and he&#39;s going to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:07.730" style="s2">that same dollar again as part of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.730" end="00:08:13.220" style="s2">for his tank of gas so that dollar was</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.460" end="00:08:16.430" style="s2">used in one-two-three transactions it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.220" end="00:08:19.130" style="s2">had a velocity of three that day in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:22.130" style="s2">other words one dollar about three</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.130" end="00:08:24.460" style="s2">dollars worth of goods and services now</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.130" end="00:08:28.070" style="s2">we&#39;re going to kick this up a notch and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.460" end="00:08:30.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to call this a country of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.070" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">ten people this economy of just ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.560" end="00:08:35.060" style="s2">people and their currency supply is one</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:39.530" style="s2">dollar that&#39;s the only dollar that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.060" end="00:08:41.960" style="s2">exists and it circulates once and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.530" end="00:08:44.900" style="s2">you&#39;ve got one dollar times the velocity</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.960" end="00:08:48.260" style="s2">of one equals a GDP the health of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.900" end="00:08:51.050" style="s2">size of the economy is one dollar if it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.260" end="00:08:54.800" style="s2">circulates twice it&#39;s two three four</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.050" end="00:08:58.280" style="s2">five six seven eight nine ten so one</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:09:02.090" style="s2">dollar times the velocity of ten or ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.280" end="00:09:04.490" style="s2">transactions equals a ten dollar GDP the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.090" end="00:09:06.410" style="s2">health of that economy now if you expand</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.490" end="00:09:09.620" style="s2">the currency supply we&#39;ve given each one</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.410" end="00:09:12.740" style="s2">of these people one dollar if they all</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.620" end="00:09:17.000" style="s2">make a transaction there has now been</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.740" end="00:09:19.550" style="s2">ten transactions but each dollar was</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.000" end="00:09:22.610" style="s2">only involved in one of them so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.550" end="00:09:26.030" style="s2">currency supply of ten dollars times one</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.610" end="00:09:28.280" style="s2">transaction each equals a ten dollar GDP</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.030" end="00:09:31.340" style="s2">so even though you&#39;ve got ten times the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.280" end="00:09:33.620" style="s2">currency supply the economy has the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.340" end="00:09:38.360" style="s2">vibrance there was ten transactions it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.620" end="00:09:41.450" style="s2">equals ten dollars then we have a second</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.360" end="00:09:43.640" style="s2">transaction a third a fourth this could</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.450" end="00:09:45.200" style="s2">be a healthy economy it could also be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.640" end="00:09:49.160" style="s2">tenth economy running into</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.200" end="00:09:51.410" style="s2">hyperinflation keynesian x&#39; that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.160" end="00:09:54.620" style="s2">type of economists that are running the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.410" end="00:09:57.560" style="s2">modern-day economy believe that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.620" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">create a healthy economy by changing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.560" end="00:10:02.570" style="s2">this figure here the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:05.090" style="s2">currency supply so the Federal Reserve</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.570" end="00:10:07.250" style="s2">thinks that by adding currency to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.090" end="00:10:09.380" style="s2">economy that they&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.250" end="00:10:12.650" style="s2">stimulate it and make the economy grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.380" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">and the thing is it isn&#39;t the quantity</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.650" end="00:10:17.270" style="s2">of currency it&#39;s the amount of goods and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:19.520" style="s2">services that are created in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.270" end="00:10:23.450" style="s2">country that determines the country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.520" end="00:10:25.850" style="s2">level of prosperity so if you just add a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.450" end="00:10:28.460" style="s2">bunch of currency all it&#39;s going to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.850" end="00:10:30.260" style="s2">eventually is drive up prices velocity</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.460" end="00:10:33.560" style="s2">will slow at first and that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.260" end="00:10:36.650" style="s2">seeing now well the same thing happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.560" end="00:10:38.510" style="s2">in Weimar Germany this is the entire</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.650" end="00:10:41.810" style="s2">hyperinflation from the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.510" end="00:10:45.950" style="s2">World War one in 1914 until the end of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.810" end="00:10:47.840" style="s2">1923 and most economists are attracted</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.950" end="00:10:49.670" style="s2">to this big hyperinflation on the end</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.840" end="00:10:51.710" style="s2">but one thing I discovered when I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.670" end="00:10:54.290" style="s2">writing my book is that there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.710" end="00:10:57.260" style="s2">always a pre hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.290" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">hyperinflation and we see one here where</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.260" end="00:11:03.020" style="s2">there&#39;s this rise of prices and quantity</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:05.450" style="s2">of currency and then it levels off for a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.020" end="00:11:08.810" style="s2">little while and then rises again and</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.450" end="00:11:11.480" style="s2">this has to do with the psychology this</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.810" end="00:11:13.520" style="s2">is the time where I said those people</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.480" end="00:11:16.580" style="s2">had been there before and experienced</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.520" end="00:11:18.460" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to zoom up on it and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.580" end="00:11:20.870" style="s2">here you see the currency supply</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.460" end="00:11:25.190" style="s2">increasing so they&#39;re they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.870" end="00:11:26.960" style="s2">monetary inflation but prices stay level</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.190" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">in the price of gold actually dropped</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.960" end="00:11:32.270" style="s2">toward the end of the war but as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:34.790" style="s2">the anxiety is lifted from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.270" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">population and they start feeling better</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.790" end="00:11:39.280" style="s2">all of that currency comes out of hiding</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:42.380" style="s2">and people start making transactions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.280" end="00:11:46.390" style="s2">velocity picks up and prices and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.380" end="00:11:50.030" style="s2">price of gold especially just rose</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.390" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">dramatically and then leveled off some</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.030" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">16 times higher than they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:58.220" style="s2">originally notice that the currency</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:12:01.130" style="s2">supply is growing at a certain rate the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.220" end="00:12:04.490" style="s2">prices are delayed and then BAM they</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.130" end="00:12:07.400" style="s2">rise to meet it and exceed it and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.490" end="00:12:10.490" style="s2">stabilize where to account for that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.400" end="00:12:12.230" style="s2">quantity of currency the back to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.490" end="00:12:14.240" style="s2">original chart here what I find</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.230" end="00:12:17.150" style="s2">interesting is that during the war it</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.240" end="00:12:19.730" style="s2">lagged and then it caught up and matched</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.150" end="00:12:22.580" style="s2">the currency supply but then as they</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.730" end="00:12:25.910" style="s2">kept on printing velocity started to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.580" end="00:12:27.950" style="s2">exceed the currency supply so prices</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.910" end="00:12:29.450" style="s2">started to rise</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.950" end="00:12:31.730" style="s2">faster than they were printing currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.450" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">and and that&#39;s the endgame for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.730" end="00:12:37.160" style="s2">hyperinflation the big lesson here is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">that the people who owned gold and</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.160" end="00:12:43.310" style="s2">silver instead of the national currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:46.010" style="s2">came out relatively unscathed or even</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.310" end="00:12:49.010" style="s2">made huge gains in their purchasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.010" end="00:12:53.240" style="s2">power now this is the u.s. currency</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.010" end="00:12:55.790" style="s2">supply from 1918 until today and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.240" end="00:12:58.310" style="s2">created all of this currency but we</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.790" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen any ravaging inflation yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.310" end="00:13:04.850" style="s2">and that is because velocity has fallen</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:08.450" style="s2">to compensate for the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.850" end="00:13:11.240" style="s2">currency but there will come a time when</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.450" end="00:13:13.970" style="s2">the psychology of the of the country</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.240" end="00:13:16.610" style="s2">changes and you will see after this</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.970" end="00:13:20.620" style="s2">short term deflation where velocity</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.610" end="00:13:24.020" style="s2">falls even further you will then see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.620" end="00:13:26.960" style="s2">velocity pick up and prices will rise</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.020" end="00:13:29.210" style="s2">and we I believe that we will go into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.960" end="00:13:31.280" style="s2">hyperinflation because they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.210" end="00:13:32.840" style="s2">create more currency than this and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.280" end="00:13:34.730" style="s2">currency is going to be sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.840" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">and velocity will have slowed and slowed</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.730" end="00:13:41.510" style="s2">and slowed to compensate it until</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:43.610" style="s2">something changes psychologically the</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.510" end="00:13:45.890" style="s2">beginning of every hyperinflation looks</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.610" end="00:13:49.370" style="s2">like everything is okay again the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.890" end="00:13:53.570" style="s2">economy gets better velocity picks up</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.370" end="00:13:55.640" style="s2">and and and that&#39;s the really danger</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.570" end="00:13:57.380" style="s2">point and nobody can see it as velocity</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.640" end="00:13:58.820" style="s2">starts picking up right of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.380" end="00:14:00.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a name for that it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.820" end="00:14:02.960" style="s2">money illusion which is before the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.950" end="00:14:04.520" style="s2">inflation really kicks in and and other</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.960" end="00:14:07.400" style="s2">gets extremely turns into hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.520" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">there is this feel-good period where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.400" end="00:14:11.570" style="s2">know there&#39;s more money around and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.580" style="s2">know unemployment dropping and people</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.570" end="00:14:15.710" style="s2">feel more prosperous the price is having</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.580" end="00:14:17.030" style="s2">quite skyrocket yet it&#39;s all losery</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.710" end="00:14:18.890" style="s2">because it will go away once the price</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.030" end="00:14:20.690" style="s2">level adjust but there is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.890" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">you know period in between and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.690" end="00:14:22.670" style="s2">feel-good period but it doesn&#39;t last</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.580" end="00:14:30.020" style="s2">inflation is a function of money supply</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:32.360" style="s2">or money printing and that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.020" end="00:14:33.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a partial function of money supply</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.360" end="00:14:35.810" style="s2">but the other part of the function is</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.770" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">behavioral it has to do a velocity which</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.810" end="00:14:38.960" style="s2">is just a psychological phenomena you</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.450" end="00:14:54.440" style="s2">to get the kind of inflation the Fed</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.550" end="00:14:55.970" style="s2">ones now here&#39;s the problem they can</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.440" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">make the money supply whatever they want</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.970" end="00:15:00.649" style="s2">they&#39;re certainly printing trillions of</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.649" end="00:15:03.680" style="s2">have not been able to bend the velocity</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.810" end="00:15:22.310" style="s2">for the Fed to you know kind of try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.029" end="00:15:24.079" style="s2">inject inflation scared try to get some</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.310" end="00:15:26.990" style="s2">inflation but what if it actually comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.079" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">what if inflation goes from 1% to 3% and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.990" end="00:15:30.110" style="s2">matters six months and stays there looks</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">like it&#39;s going to three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.110" end="00:15:34.040" style="s2">percent well the next stop is 10% it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:35.750" style="s2">not the Fed thinks they can dial it back</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.040" end="00:15:37.459" style="s2">down to two and a half which we&#39;re that</p>

<p begin="00:15:37.459" end="00:15:41.420" style="s2">what they&#39;ll find is once that once that</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.990" end="00:17:49.510" style="s2">were some lessons that should have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.250" end="00:17:51.580" style="s2">learned you know banks should have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.510" end="00:17:53.740" style="s2">broken into smaller units derivatives</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.560" style="s2">learned from that instead what did we do</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.070" end="00:18:01.390" style="s2">we did the opposite we repealed</p>

<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.620" style="s2">you rely about 30 to my leverage which</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.700" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">think not it would be nice if we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.360" end="00:28:54.170" style="s2">listening to people that have been right</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:57.860" style="s2">rather than the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.170" end="00:29:00.590" style="s2">theories and it would be great if they</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.860" end="00:29:02.540" style="s2">would allow the free market to work but</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.590" end="00:29:04.730" style="s2">that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s going to happen</p>
