<p begin="00:00:15.440" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">three difficult stories tonight and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.010" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">hopefully my plan is to get through all</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">three of them so we&#39;ll see how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:32.759" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to talk about the story</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">of sodom and gomorrah and then the story</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.759" end="00:00:40.350" style="s2">of the sacrifice of Isaac which is an</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:42.149" style="s2">extremely complicated complicated story</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.350" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">and so we&#39;ll try to make some headway</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.149" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">with that the story of Sodom and</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:48.020" style="s2">Gomorrah is plenty complicated - all</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:51.899" style="s2">right so what we established last week</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.020" end="00:00:54.199" style="s2">at least in part was this idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.899" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">Abrahamic narratives are set up as</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.199" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">punctuated epochs I suppose in Abraham&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:04.019" style="s2">life and we were hypothesizing that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">know you set out a goal for yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.019" end="00:01:09.000" style="s2">your life it&#39;s like a stage in your life</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">you might say that and then when you run</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.000" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">that goal to its end when that stage</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">comes to an end then you have to regroup</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">and orient yourself once again and I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">making the case that that&#39;s a good time</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:27.780" style="s2">to make necessary sacrifices you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:32.100" style="s2">and part of that because as you move</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.780" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">through your life you have to shed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.100" end="00:01:38.659" style="s2">which is no longer necessary and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">otherwise it accretes around you and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.659" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">holds you down and you perish sooner</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">than you should and I think that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:50.149" style="s2">large part because if you don&#39;t dispense</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">with your life as you move through it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.149" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">then the stress of all that undone</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.719" style="s2">business and all those unmade decisions</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:00.290" style="s2">turns into a kind of chaos around you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.719" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">and that chaos puts you in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.290" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">psychophysiological emergency</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">preparedness chronically and that just</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">ages you and so it&#39;s necessary in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:13.350" style="s2">sense to stay light on your feet and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">also I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.350" end="00:02:21.150" style="s2">to renew your commitment to your aim</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:23.580" style="s2">upward and I believe that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.150" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">the sacrificial routines in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.580" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">Abrahamic stories dramatized I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">already that these things are often</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:36.110" style="s2">first portrayed very dramatically and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:38.520" style="s2">concretely before they become</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.110" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">psychologists and we&#39;ll see because one</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">of the things that happens tonight as</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:45.000" style="s2">well in these stories is that when God</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:47.130" style="s2">makes his covenant with Abraham this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.000" end="00:02:49.500" style="s2">the next part of the story it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.130" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">when the idea of circumcision is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.500" end="00:02:54.210" style="s2">introduced into ancient Hebrew culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:56.610" style="s2">and others every bit of evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.210" end="00:02:59.970" style="s2">other cultures were utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.610" end="00:03:03.090" style="s2">circumcision beforehand so it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.970" end="00:03:05.730" style="s2">necessarily a novel invention of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.090" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">Abrahamic people but I see its</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.730" end="00:03:11.990" style="s2">introduction as a step on the road to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">the psychologize ation of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.990" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">sacrifice right first of all it&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">up something concrete and then second</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:23.850" style="s2">it&#39;s signified by the sacrifice of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">part of the body instead of for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.850" end="00:03:27.090" style="s2">of the whole it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.530" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">it&#39;s dramatizing the idea that you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.090" end="00:03:30.960" style="s2">to give up a part of yourself for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:32.460" style="s2">sake of the whole and eventually well by</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.960" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">modern times that becomes virtually</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.460" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">completely psycho psychological and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">in its essence in that we all understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:42.980" style="s2">perhaps not as well as we should but at</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:47.100" style="s2">least well enough to explain it that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.980" end="00:03:50.940" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to make sacrifices to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.100" end="00:03:53.190" style="s2">move ahead in life one of the themes</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.940" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">that I&#39;d like to explore tonight in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.190" end="00:03:58.530" style="s2">relationship especially to the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">of Isaac is that you know once humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.530" end="00:04:03.960" style="s2">had established the idea that sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">was necessary to move ahead which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.960" end="00:04:09.390" style="s2">really it&#39;s a discovery of incalculable</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">magnitude right the idea that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.390" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">that you can give up something in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2">present and that will in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:17.730" style="s2">ensure a better future is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.780" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">unbelievable achievement it&#39;s equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.730" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">to the discovery of the future it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:23.310" style="s2">equivalent to the discovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:26.280" style="s2">utility of work like its importance</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.310" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">can&#39;t be overstated okay so it took a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.280" end="00:04:28.919" style="s2">long time for people</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:30.569" style="s2">figure this out animals haven&#39;t figured</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.919" end="00:04:32.460" style="s2">it out at all right we&#39;ve figured it out</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.569" end="00:04:34.229" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard for people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.460" end="00:04:37.139" style="s2">make sacrifices because of course the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.229" end="00:04:38.669" style="s2">present has a major grip on you as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.139" end="00:04:39.240" style="s2">should because in some way you live in</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.669" end="00:04:42.599" style="s2">the present</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.240" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">so anyways there&#39;s the twin problem of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.599" end="00:04:45.690" style="s2">getting the whole idea of sacrifice up</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:47.039" style="s2">and running and then figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.690" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">exactly what it means but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.039" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">problem that branches off that too or a</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">two-fold problem so the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:58.139" style="s2">that sacrifice is necessary to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:04:59.639" style="s2">the that the future is safe and secure</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.139" end="00:05:02.310" style="s2">and productive and positive and all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.639" end="00:05:04.020" style="s2">those things ok so then then a question</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.310" end="00:05:07.020" style="s2">immediate two questions immediately rise</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.020" end="00:05:08.970" style="s2">from that right one is well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.020" end="00:05:10.289" style="s2">proper sacrifice now we already talked</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.970" end="00:05:11.729" style="s2">about that a little bit with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.289" end="00:05:14.310" style="s2">Cain and Abel and one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.729" end="00:05:16.949" style="s2">saw was that Cain&#39;s sacrifice whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.310" end="00:05:18.509" style="s2">it was was wrong and Abel&#39;s was right</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.949" end="00:05:20.310" style="s2">Noah&#39;s seemed to be right</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.509" end="00:05:22.650" style="s2">Abraham seems to be right there is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.310" end="00:05:23.819" style="s2">something about a sacrifice that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.650" end="00:05:25.949" style="s2">correct there&#39;s something about a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.819" end="00:05:28.050" style="s2">sacrifice that can be incorrect the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.949" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">question is what would be the maximally</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.050" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">correct sacrifice so because that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:34.620" style="s2">obvious question to arise from the mere</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:36.449" style="s2">observation that sacrifice is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.620" end="00:05:39.270" style="s2">okay if you&#39;re going to sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.449" end="00:05:40.949" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary well how is it that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.270" end="00:05:42.870" style="s2">would behave if you were going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.949" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">really well if you&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.870" end="00:05:47.520" style="s2">perfectly okay so that&#39;s question number</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:50.820" style="s2">one and then question number two might</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.520" end="00:05:53.639" style="s2">be well if the future can be better</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.820" end="00:05:55.770" style="s2">because of the sacrifice and sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.639" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">can vary in quality then how much better</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.770" end="00:06:00.599" style="s2">could this set the future be if your</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:02.729" style="s2">sacrifice was of the highest quality</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.599" end="00:06:04.229" style="s2">right there&#39;s a limit issue there and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.729" end="00:06:05.580" style="s2">the limit is something like well how</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.229" end="00:06:07.650" style="s2">good could your life be if you really</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.580" end="00:06:09.930" style="s2">got your act together and you gave up</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.650" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">all the things that we&#39;re impeding you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.930" end="00:06:14.550" style="s2">in your movement forward if you did that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:16.949" style="s2">forthrightly and and and with with</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.550" end="00:06:18.900" style="s2">integrity and with seriousness with with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.949" end="00:06:21.569" style="s2">dead seriousness and you tried to set</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.900" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">your life right what is the upper limits</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.569" end="00:06:26.969" style="s2">with regards to how your life might lay</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:29.340" style="s2">itself out and I would say well we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.969" end="00:06:32.039" style="s2">know the answer to that but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.340" end="00:06:33.930" style="s2">like the idea of something like the City</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.039" end="00:06:35.310" style="s2">of God or the kingdom of God on earth or</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.930" end="00:06:39.000" style="s2">the re-establishment of paradise</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.310" end="00:06:41.190" style="s2">something like that is the answer of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.000" end="00:06:43.140" style="s2">imagination to the court</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.140" end="00:06:48.360" style="s2">sacrifice was optimized and those are</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.290" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">archetypal questions right an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.360" end="00:06:52.680" style="s2">question is a question that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.420" style="s2">asks whether they know it or not because</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.680" end="00:06:56.310" style="s2">sometimes you can act out a question an</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.420" end="00:06:58.170" style="s2">archetypical estin is a question that</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.310" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">everyone asks and an archetypal answer</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.170" end="00:07:04.200" style="s2">is the answer that can&#39;t be made any</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:05.490" style="s2">better to that question so I can give</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.200" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">you an example of that the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.490" end="00:07:09.630" style="s2">Christ&#39;s passion is an archetypal story</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:12.030" style="s2">is because it&#39;s a kind of limit right</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.630" end="00:07:14.070" style="s2">it&#39;s the worst possible set of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.030" end="00:07:17.250" style="s2">that can happen to the best possible</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.070" end="00:07:19.560" style="s2">person so it&#39;s a story that constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.250" end="00:07:21.570" style="s2">a limit it has nothing to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.560" end="00:07:22.950" style="s2">factual reality of the story that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.570" end="00:07:24.990" style="s2">completely independent issue I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.950" end="00:07:26.670" style="s2">speaking about this psychologically is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.990" end="00:07:28.860" style="s2">that certain stories can exhaust</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:31.320" style="s2">themselves in a perfect form and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.860" end="00:07:33.390" style="s2">would be the archetypal form so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.320" end="00:07:35.460" style="s2">the territory that we&#39;re going to wander</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.390" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">around in a little bit today and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.460" end="00:07:40.110" style="s2">use the stories as anchors in thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">lot about the Sodom and Gomorrah story</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.110" end="00:07:44.580" style="s2">because it has its classically</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:46.620" style="s2">associated with a biblical injunction</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.580" end="00:07:48.360" style="s2">against homosexuality and that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.620" end="00:07:50.580" style="s2">how it&#39;s read I would say in particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.360" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">by the more fundamentalist end of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.580" end="00:07:53.700" style="s2">Christian spectrum and I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.560" style="s2">about that a lot because it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.700" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">damn clear that the story of Sodom and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.560" end="00:07:59.190" style="s2">Gomorrah has something to do with sexual</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:00.480" style="s2">and propriety but I&#39;ve really come to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.190" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">the conclusion and it&#39;s very little to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.480" end="00:08:06.300" style="s2">do with homosexuality so we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:07.920" style="s2">that interpretation prevails as we walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.300" end="00:08:10.590" style="s2">through this tonight okay so we&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.920" end="00:08:13.320" style="s2">with a bit of a recap from last week so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.590" end="00:08:15.900" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s had had his last adventure and</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.320" end="00:08:17.550" style="s2">he&#39;s 90 years old ninety nine years old</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.900" end="00:08:19.800" style="s2">actually the Lord appeared to Abram and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.550" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">said unto him I am the Almighty God walk</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.800" end="00:08:25.110" style="s2">before me and be thou perfect well</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:28.620" style="s2">that&#39;s quite the command now</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.110" end="00:08:33.540" style="s2">Alexander McLaren who we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.620" end="00:08:36.090" style="s2">before it elaborated upon this slightly</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.540" end="00:08:38.190" style="s2">and this is what he had to say it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.090" end="00:08:39.900" style="s2">is not precisely walking with God the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.190" end="00:08:42.210" style="s2">idea of walking before God it is rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.900" end="00:08:44.040" style="s2">that of an act of life spent in</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.210" end="00:08:45.900" style="s2">continual consciousness of being naked</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.040" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">and opened before the eyes of him to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.900" end="00:08:50.820" style="s2">whom we have to give an account okay so</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:53.220" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s an idea that&#39;s in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.820" end="00:08:54.440" style="s2">with the notion that what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:08:59.150" style="s2">an Abrahamic story</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.440" end="00:09:01.700" style="s2">is the call to adventure of the of man</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.150" end="00:09:03.590" style="s2">of the typical person right because your</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.700" end="00:09:04.790" style="s2">life in some sense is an adventure and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.590" end="00:09:07.070" style="s2">suppose the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.790" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">you&#39;re confronted by things that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.070" end="00:09:11.330" style="s2">cannot understand that you have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:13.850" style="s2">mastered there&#39;s a heavy price to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.330" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">paid if you fail to conduct yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.850" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">appropriately and there&#39;s a large reward</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:20.750" style="s2">to be gained if you conduct yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:23.330" style="s2">properly and so that pretty much defines</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.750" end="00:09:24.710" style="s2">an adventure story and God calls to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.330" end="00:09:26.060" style="s2">Abraham and tells him to move out into</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.710" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">the world to leave what he&#39;s familiar</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:32.210" style="s2">with to go into the strange lands of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">famine and tyranny and to find his place</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.210" end="00:09:38.540" style="s2">and that works out quite nicely for</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.010" style="s2">Abraham and so what that also means is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.540" end="00:09:42.410" style="s2">that because Abraham is doing that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.010" end="00:09:44.900" style="s2">consciously at least according to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.410" end="00:09:47.720" style="s2">interpretation that he&#39;s not naive in</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.900" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">his in his determination to move forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.720" end="00:09:51.440" style="s2">you know I mean I&#39;ve dealt with lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:53.540" style="s2">people who have anxiety disorders you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.440" end="00:09:55.130" style="s2">know and one thing about people who have</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.540" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">anxiety disorders is they are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.130" end="00:10:00.530" style="s2">mysterious to me I understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:02.870" style="s2">it&#39;s no problem for me to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.530" end="00:10:04.400" style="s2">people have anxiety disorders or why</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.870" end="00:10:06.830" style="s2">they&#39;re depressed or why they have</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.400" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">substance use problems the mystery to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.570" style="s2">is always why people don&#39;t have all of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:13.400" style="s2">those things at once because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.570" end="00:10:14.780" style="s2">has a reason to be anxious in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.400" end="00:10:16.610" style="s2">have the ultimate reason to be anxious</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.780" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">because we know that we&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.610" end="00:10:20.840" style="s2">and we know that we&#39;re going to die and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:22.910" style="s2">how you cannot be anxious under those</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.840" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">circumstances is a great mystery it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.910" end="00:10:27.050" style="s2">massive mystery and the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:29.180" style="s2">applies with regards to depression and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.050" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">then the same thing applies to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.180" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2">degree with regards to drug and alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.310" style="s2">abuse because I said last week there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:36.290" style="s2">plenty of reasons to drown your</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.310" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">consciousness in alcohol that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.290" end="00:10:41.270" style="s2">we could refer to the aforementioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:43.880" style="s2">anxiety depression not least and so and</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.270" end="00:10:45.620" style="s2">the and the sorts of drugs that people</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.880" end="00:10:48.200" style="s2">are prone to take our chemicals that</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.620" end="00:10:55.160" style="s2">take the affective edge off the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.200" end="00:10:59.630" style="s2">of life so so back to back to the issue</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.160" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">of fear being Abraham is self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.630" end="00:11:03.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what this commentary says but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.670" end="00:11:04.910" style="s2">thing is as he moves forward despite</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.320" end="00:11:06.680" style="s2">that he&#39;s self-conscious and he knows</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.910" end="00:11:08.389" style="s2">the danger but he moves forward despite</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.680" end="00:11:10.639" style="s2">that and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.389" end="00:11:13.249" style="s2">the appropriate response in the face of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.639" end="00:11:14.869" style="s2">actual non naive understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.249" end="00:11:16.429" style="s2">constitutes life like if you&#39;re naive</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.869" end="00:11:18.259" style="s2">and you move forward it&#39;s like well what</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.429" end="00:11:19.970" style="s2">the hell do you know you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.259" end="00:11:22.939" style="s2">courage in naivety because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.970" end="00:11:24.350" style="s2">know what there is to stop you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.939" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2">know what dangers you might apprehend</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.350" end="00:11:30.619" style="s2">but to be aware of what it is that your</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:32.239" style="s2">problem is so to be alert existentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.619" end="00:11:33.860" style="s2">let&#39;s say or to be fully self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.239" end="00:11:35.689" style="s2">means that you&#39;re perfectly aware of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.860" end="00:11:37.850" style="s2">your limitations and how you might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.689" end="00:11:39.499" style="s2">hurt and then to make the decision to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.850" end="00:11:41.480" style="s2">move forward into the unknown and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.499" end="00:11:43.489" style="s2">land of the stranger anyways that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:45.559" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s one of the secrets to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.489" end="00:11:48.439" style="s2">a good life and I can say that really</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.559" end="00:11:50.269" style="s2">without fear of contradiction I would I</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.439" end="00:11:52.129" style="s2">would say because the clinical</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.269" end="00:11:54.499" style="s2">literature on this is very very very</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.129" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">clear what you do with people who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.499" end="00:11:59.209" style="s2">afraid and to some degree depressed but</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:00.799" style="s2">certainly anxious is you lay out what</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.209" end="00:12:02.899" style="s2">what they&#39;re anxious about first of all</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.799" end="00:12:04.879" style="s2">in in detail what is it that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.899" end="00:12:07.809" style="s2">afraid of what might happen and then you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.879" end="00:12:10.040" style="s2">decompose it into small problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.809" end="00:12:12.290" style="s2">hypothetically manageable problems and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.040" end="00:12:13.699" style="s2">then you have the person expose</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.290" end="00:12:15.919" style="s2">themselves to this thing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.699" end="00:12:17.569" style="s2">afraid of and what happens isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.919" end="00:12:20.089" style="s2">they get less afraid that isn&#39;t what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.569" end="00:12:21.980" style="s2">clinical literature indicates exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.089" end="00:12:24.649" style="s2">what happens instead is they get braver</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.980" end="00:12:26.209" style="s2">and that&#39;s not the same thing right cuz</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.649" end="00:12:27.589" style="s2">if you get less afraid it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.209" end="00:12:29.809" style="s2">the world isn&#39;t just dangerous as I</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.589" end="00:12:31.610" style="s2">thought it was you know silly me if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.809" end="00:12:33.019" style="s2">get braver that&#39;s not what happens what</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.500" end="00:17:57.059" style="s2">the best way to act is to lift your aim</p>

<p begin="00:17:57.059" end="00:17:59.940" style="s2">together and to tell the truth and to</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.780" end="00:18:44.100" style="s2">there and really really you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.910" end="00:18:45.390" style="s2">there and you go find somewhere where if</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.100" end="00:18:46.770" style="s2">you work hard and do what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.200" end="00:19:14.940" style="s2">right what&#39;s dramatic I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.820" end="00:19:17.490" style="s2">certainly it certainly affects a man</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.940" end="00:19:19.169" style="s2">where he&#39;s most concerned to be affected</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.490" end="00:19:22.350" style="s2">there&#39;s something like that and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.169" end="00:19:23.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a sacrifice that has a certain I</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.350" end="00:19:25.020" style="s2">would say a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.309" end="00:19:26.580" style="s2">unforgettable &#39;ti that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.020" end="00:19:28.590" style="s2">first thing and a certain degree of pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.580" end="00:19:29.700" style="s2">and threat that goes along with it so</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.590" end="00:19:32.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.700" end="00:19:35.730" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing now you can argue and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.370" end="00:19:38.549" style="s2">think there is an argument a case to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.730" end="00:19:41.910" style="s2">made about whether or not in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.549" end="00:19:43.830" style="s2">world circumcision is a reasonable is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.910" end="00:19:45.059" style="s2">something reasonable to inflict on</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.830" end="00:19:48.750" style="s2">infants I don&#39;t want to have that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.059" end="00:19:51.090" style="s2">conversation at all but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.750" end="00:19:53.340" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant to this particular issue</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.090" end="00:19:55.429" style="s2">because we&#39;re talking about something</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.340" end="00:19:59.400" style="s2">different we&#39;re talking about humanity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.429" end="00:20:01.770" style="s2">attempt to reconcile themselves to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.400" end="00:20:02.279" style="s2">fact that something has to be given up</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.770" end="00:20:04.200" style="s2">in order</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.279" end="00:20:06.090" style="s2">something else to happen and to try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.200" end="00:20:08.099" style="s2">really work through that idea and to</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.090" end="00:20:10.529" style="s2">make it into a psychological reality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.099" end="00:20:11.639" style="s2">so far what we&#39;ve seen in the biblical</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.529" end="00:20:13.019" style="s2">stories is that when you make a</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.639" end="00:20:15.059" style="s2">sacrifice it&#39;s not really something</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.019" end="00:20:17.429" style="s2">personal or psychological right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.059" end="00:20:19.529" style="s2">something external and dramatic you give</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.429" end="00:20:21.779" style="s2">up something that you own you don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.529" end="00:20:24.479" style="s2">up something that you are or that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.779" end="00:20:26.549" style="s2">of you and it&#39;s actually more of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.479" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">sacrifice to give up something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.549" end="00:20:30.509" style="s2">part of you or something that you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:32.279" style="s2">than to give up something that you own I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.509" end="00:20:34.379" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a subtle distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.279" end="00:20:36.210" style="s2">because in some sense the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.379" end="00:20:38.969" style="s2">between what you own and what you are is</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.210" end="00:20:41.369" style="s2">subtle right I mean it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.969" end="00:20:43.469" style="s2">overwhelmingly subtle but but people</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.369" end="00:20:44.849" style="s2">identify with their possessions and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.469" end="00:20:46.169" style="s2">need to because otherwise they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.849" end="00:20:48.389" style="s2">care for them and they need their</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.169" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">possessions in order to live so their</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.389" end="00:20:53.309" style="s2">possessions are in some sense integral</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:56.519" style="s2">to them but this transformation here of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.309" end="00:20:57.839" style="s2">an act that was external and associated</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.519" end="00:20:59.580" style="s2">essentially with possessions to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.839" end="00:21:02.249" style="s2">something that was actually at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.580" end="00:21:04.769" style="s2">part of the body brings it much closer</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.249" end="00:21:06.690" style="s2">to it brings it much closer to the to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.769" end="00:21:10.950" style="s2">the to the individual as a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.690" end="00:21:12.599" style="s2">reality it&#39;s something like that and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.950" end="00:21:14.219" style="s2">shall circumscribe is circumcised the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.599" end="00:21:16.889" style="s2">flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.219" end="00:21:19.619" style="s2">token of the Covenant betwixt me and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.889" end="00:21:21.899" style="s2">it&#39;s also a permanent marker you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.619" end="00:21:24.089" style="s2">and I&#39;ve read a fair bit about practices</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.899" end="00:21:25.469" style="s2">like tattooing and body scarification</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.089" end="00:21:27.359" style="s2">you know which is those are very very</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.469" end="00:21:29.429" style="s2">common practices right they&#39;re human</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.359" end="00:21:31.049" style="s2">universals actually no matter where you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.429" end="00:21:32.909" style="s2">go around the world you mean you see a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.049" end="00:21:34.649" style="s2">couple of things first of all almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.909" end="00:21:36.809" style="s2">without exception people wear clothing</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.649" end="00:21:40.109" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s relatively minimal</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.809" end="00:21:42.210" style="s2">clothing but but it&#39;s and often it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.109" end="00:21:45.269" style="s2">more decorative than protective but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.210" end="00:21:46.710" style="s2">almost inevitably clothing and the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.269" end="00:21:49.469" style="s2">thing that you see is that people do</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.710" end="00:21:51.839" style="s2">scarify and tattoo themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.469" end="00:21:53.389" style="s2">do that in some manner to catalyze their</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.839" end="00:21:56.369" style="s2">identity right they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.389" end="00:21:59.009" style="s2">transform themselves from a generic</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.369" end="00:22:01.409" style="s2">person in some sense to a person that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.009" end="00:22:03.450" style="s2">been designed by their own hand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.409" end="00:22:05.639" style="s2">something like that they&#39;re it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.450" end="00:22:07.499" style="s2">marker of developing identity and some</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.639" end="00:22:10.139" style="s2">of it seems to be catalyzed with pain</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.499" end="00:22:12.359" style="s2">you know that modern people who tattoo</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.139" end="00:22:14.460" style="s2">and I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.359" end="00:22:15.720" style="s2">tattooing because actually I&#39;m not but</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.460" end="00:22:17.730" style="s2">that but that</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.720" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">my own particular bias and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.730" end="00:22:22.530" style="s2">tattoo that&#39;s fine with me</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">I&#39;m also not saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.530" end="00:22:26.789" style="s2">anything wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:28.620" style="s2">but one of the things you do see what we</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.789" end="00:22:30.780" style="s2">the people who have it to tattoo do</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.620" end="00:22:33.720" style="s2">report is a couple of things is that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.780" end="00:22:35.340" style="s2">pain is actually necessary and that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.720" end="00:22:37.559" style="s2">pain is actually something that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.340" end="00:22:39.419" style="s2">establish something like a memory so</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.559" end="00:22:40.860" style="s2">well it&#39;s a memory because of the pain</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.419" end="00:22:43.320" style="s2">because you plenty well remember things</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.860" end="00:22:45.270" style="s2">that hurt but it&#39;s also a memory because</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.320" end="00:22:46.950" style="s2">it&#39;s actually etched on you right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.270" end="00:22:49.169" style="s2">not something that you can just abandon</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.950" end="00:22:50.669" style="s2">and forget and so a circumcision is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.169" end="00:22:52.380" style="s2">exactly the same thing it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.669" end="00:22:54.299" style="s2">don&#39;t forget it because it&#39;s part of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.380" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">and so it makes a good token for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.299" end="00:22:59.250" style="s2">covenant and so that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:01.320" style="s2">rationale here from from speaking from a</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.250" end="00:23:03.929" style="s2">psychological perspective it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.320" end="00:23:06.090" style="s2">indicate as well that the the damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.929" end="00:23:07.770" style="s2">that&#39;s happening is serious and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.090" end="00:23:10.919" style="s2">also that was the case with the earlier</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.770" end="00:23:12.419" style="s2">sacrifices of animals it&#39;s like modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.919" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">people don&#39;t do this like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.419" end="00:23:16.620" style="s2">how serious you would take a vow if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">sacrificed a goat in your backyard you</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.620" end="00:23:20.220" style="s2">know it&#39;s actually a very dramatic thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:22.320" style="s2">to do you know you think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.220" end="00:23:25.409" style="s2">primitive and perhaps it is archaic and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.320" end="00:23:27.210" style="s2">and and no doubt it is but it&#39;s also to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.409" end="00:23:28.740" style="s2">take the life of something and to spill</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.210" end="00:23:30.179" style="s2">its blood that&#39;s no joke that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.740" end="00:23:32.280" style="s2">something you remember especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.179" end="00:23:34.230" style="s2">haven&#39;t done it before and we actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.280" end="00:23:36.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know what we would need to do in</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.230" end="00:23:38.280" style="s2">order to take some things seriously you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.750" end="00:23:40.110" style="s2">know because we all do things like make</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.280" end="00:23:41.460" style="s2">new year&#39;s resolutions about how we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:49.020" style="s2">in part is because we don&#39;t know how to</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.020" end="00:23:54.299" style="s2">let&#39;s say so that we remember that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.460" end="00:24:22.740" style="s2">seriousness we won&#39;t do it so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.909" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">something to be said for rituals of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.740" end="00:24:27.480" style="s2">seriousness and I think this is one of</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.560" end="00:24:57.630" style="s2">man and the dedication of the new man</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.380" end="00:24:59.310" style="s2">unto holiness it&#39;s like a baptism that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.020" end="00:25:26.610" style="s2">and to reconstitute itself and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.150" end="00:25:28.950" style="s2">there&#39;s an echo of that idea here the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.610" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">flesh was cast away that the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.950" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">might grow strong and the change of name</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:34.830" style="s2">and Abram and Sarai was typical of this</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.900" end="00:26:19.170" style="s2">those might be menstruation because</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.170" end="00:26:24.330" style="s2">and there has been some indication that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:26.010" style="s2">circumcision is like a male it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.330" end="00:26:27.870" style="s2">the male equivalent of menstruation</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.010" end="00:26:29.160" style="s2">something like that because of the blood</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.840" end="00:26:34.410" style="s2">is the case with women when they give</p>

<p begin="00:27:41.259" end="00:27:45.759" style="s2">something to do because God told Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.419" end="00:27:48.309" style="s2">to include all of the people of his</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.309" end="00:27:53.589" style="s2">that that that really meant that he was</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.589" end="00:27:57.249" style="s2">around them like the ark except the</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.249" end="00:28:02.289" style="s2">right so it was it was a spiritual or</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.289" end="00:28:08.469" style="s2">everyone who was of that household was</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.979" end="00:28:10.809" style="s2">required to occupy or obliged or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.469" end="00:28:13.479" style="s2">privileged to occupy and there was also</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.809" end="00:28:15.729" style="s2">an injunction to Abraham with regards to</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.729" end="00:28:19.539" style="s2">established a covenant with God which we</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.799" end="00:28:22.749" style="s2">could say is something like his decision</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.730" end="00:28:58.530" style="s2">definitely something very much worth</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.580" end="00:30:17.400" style="s2">might say well what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.760" end="00:30:19.920" style="s2">potential it doesn&#39;t exist it isn&#39;t here</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.400" end="00:30:22.170" style="s2">now you can&#39;t measure it or weigh it you</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.920" end="00:30:24.990" style="s2">can&#39;t get a grip on it and they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.170" end="00:30:26.310" style="s2">don&#39;t rationalize you know perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.990" end="00:30:28.260" style="s2">well what I mean when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.310" end="00:30:30.300" style="s2">your potential and so we could and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.260" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">do and everyone does and everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.300" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">exactly what that means and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:36.870" style="s2">metaphysical reality that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:38.580" style="s2">immediately accept as real and also</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.870" end="00:30:41.040" style="s2">castigate ourselves for not fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.580" end="00:30:42.600" style="s2">and others to like because you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.040" end="00:30:43.740" style="s2">not happy when the people around you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.600" end="00:30:46.110" style="s2">especially if you love them don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.740" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">fulfill their potential you really feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.110" end="00:30:49.350" style="s2">that something has gone wrong and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:50.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a transcendent reality and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.350" end="00:30:53.730" style="s2">potential and then when you hypothesize</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.940" end="00:30:56.460" style="s2">an ideal that you might pursue which you</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.730" end="00:30:58.590" style="s2">always do if you pursue anything right</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.460" end="00:31:00.390" style="s2">because to pursue something means you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.590" end="00:31:02.220" style="s2">don&#39;t already have it you&#39;re pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.390" end="00:31:04.020" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t exist you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.220" end="00:31:06.060" style="s2">probably not pursuing something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.020" end="00:31:07.530" style="s2">worse than what you already have because</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.060" end="00:31:08.880" style="s2">why the hell would you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.530" end="00:31:11.790" style="s2">sooo it right that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.880" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">counterproductive so in in the mere fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.790" end="00:31:17.460" style="s2">of your pursuit you you pause it a</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:20.220" style="s2">transcendent reality that you can that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.460" end="00:31:22.440" style="s2">you can that you can journey towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.220" end="00:31:24.690" style="s2">that&#39;s more valuable than the reality</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.440" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">that you have now that&#39;s predicated in</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.690" end="00:31:29.280" style="s2">some sense on something like an eternal</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:32.820" style="s2">Verity or an eternal truth it partakes</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.280" end="00:31:34.860" style="s2">in the ideal and so we have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.820" end="00:31:36.420" style="s2">relationship with the transcendent and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.860" end="00:31:38.550" style="s2">you might say well that doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.420" end="00:31:41.220" style="s2">have to personify the transcendent say</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.550" end="00:31:44.010" style="s2">as Jehovah you know the God the Father</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.220" end="00:31:45.660" style="s2">but there&#39;s also some damn good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.010" end="00:31:49.040" style="s2">for doing that because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.660" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">that I&#39;ve realized thinking through this</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.040" end="00:31:54.390" style="s2">covenant idea and also the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">idea is that the idea that the future is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.390" end="00:32:00.360" style="s2">a judgmental father is a really really</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.280" style="s2">good idea you know because you think</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.360" end="00:32:04.230" style="s2">about what the future is in part I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.280" end="00:32:06.380" style="s2">the future is however the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:08.610" style="s2">is going to lay itself out over the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.380" end="00:32:11.010" style="s2">endless amount of time that isn&#39;t what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.610" end="00:32:13.290" style="s2">mean I think more about your future now</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.010" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">mostly your future is the future that</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.290" end="00:32:16.590" style="s2">you&#39;re going to negotiate with other</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">people but they&#39;re going to be other</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.590" end="00:32:20.280" style="s2">people in the future and some of those</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:22.740" style="s2">people are going to be you in the future</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.280" end="00:32:24.420" style="s2">and family members in the future and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.740" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">what&#39;s happening right now is that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.420" end="00:32:30.540" style="s2">you make the sacrifices properly then</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:32.310" style="s2">you&#39;re actually pleasing that future set</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.540" end="00:32:34.590" style="s2">of people and that future set of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.310" end="00:32:36.930" style="s2">is definitely going to serve as a judge</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.590" end="00:32:38.820" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what it does that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.930" end="00:32:40.470" style="s2">precisely what it does and so you might</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.820" end="00:32:43.590" style="s2">say well it was the brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.470" end="00:32:46.020" style="s2">imagination of mankind that hypothesized</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.590" end="00:32:48.150" style="s2">that the best way to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.020" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">social group including the family but</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.150" end="00:32:52.830" style="s2">also including you as your future self</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:55.920" style="s2">was to consider that you live in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.830" end="00:32:59.250" style="s2">relationship with a future father who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.920" end="00:33:02.040" style="s2">a judge it&#39;s like yes that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.250" end="00:33:03.750" style="s2">right now is it right right or is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.040" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">psychologically right well it&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.750" end="00:33:08.190" style="s2">psychologically right and you know one</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:11.370" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve learned about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.190" end="00:33:12.810" style="s2">biblical stories is that to say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.370" end="00:33:16.250" style="s2">they&#39;re psychologically right doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.810" end="00:33:20.040" style="s2">exhaust the ways in which they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.250" end="00:33:21.389" style="s2">but it at least gives rational modern</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.040" end="00:33:23.429" style="s2">people who are skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.389" end="00:33:29.129" style="s2">properly so a better way of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.429" end="00:33:31.109" style="s2">grip on them so and the uncircumcised</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.129" end="00:33:33.089" style="s2">man child whose flesh of his foreskin is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.109" end="00:33:34.950" style="s2">not circumcised that soul shall be cut</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.089" end="00:33:37.879" style="s2">off from his people he had broken my</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.950" end="00:33:40.649" style="s2">covenant so it&#39;s a serious contractual</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.879" end="00:33:42.749" style="s2">relationship now I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.649" end="00:33:44.190" style="s2">how to understand this and I remembered</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.749" end="00:33:47.639" style="s2">this old story which I&#39;m going to read</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.190" end="00:33:49.559" style="s2">to you about a monkey so there&#39;s an old</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.639" end="00:33:51.359" style="s2">impossibly apocryphal story about how to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.559" end="00:33:53.759" style="s2">catch a monkey that illustrates this set</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.359" end="00:33:56.039" style="s2">of ideas very well first so goes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.759" end="00:33:58.919" style="s2">story you have to find a large narrow</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.039" end="00:34:00.479" style="s2">neck jar just barely wide enough in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.919" end="00:34:03.209" style="s2">diameter for a monkey to put his hand</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.479" end="00:34:05.849" style="s2">inside and then you have to fill the jar</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.209" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">up with rocks so that it&#39;s too heavy for</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.849" end="00:34:09.750" style="s2">the monkey to carry away and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:13.079" style="s2">scatter some treats around the jar that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.750" end="00:34:15.299" style="s2">are attractive to monkeys and close to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.079" end="00:34:17.309" style="s2">the jar and then you put a few of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.299" end="00:34:18.839" style="s2">treats inside the jar and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.309" end="00:34:20.129" style="s2">first part of the trick and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.839" end="00:34:21.629" style="s2">second part of the trick is the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.129" end="00:34:23.220" style="s2">comes along and gathers up the treats</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.629" end="00:34:25.519" style="s2">and then puts his hand in the jar and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.220" end="00:34:28.109" style="s2">grabs the treats that are in there but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.519" end="00:34:29.519" style="s2">it&#39;s narrow necked and so once the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.109" end="00:34:31.559" style="s2">monkey puts his hand in there and grabs</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.519" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">the goodies then he can&#39;t get his hand</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.559" end="00:34:35.039" style="s2">out of the damn jar and so then you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.929" end="00:34:36.720" style="s2">just come along and pick up the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.039" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">and like too bad for the monkey rights</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.720" end="00:34:41.819" style="s2">like he shouldn&#39;t let go of what he had</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:43.710" style="s2">so that something terrible didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.819" end="00:34:45.960" style="s2">to him but that isn&#39;t what the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.710" end="00:34:48.659" style="s2">will do because he can&#39;t sacrifice the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.960" end="00:34:50.909" style="s2">part for the hole and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.659" end="00:34:52.950" style="s2">about the circumcision story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.909" end="00:34:56.129" style="s2">about that it&#39;s about sacrificing the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:34:57.329" style="s2">part to save the whole and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.129" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">there&#39;s an echo of that in the New</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.329" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">Testament if I remember correctly I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:04.200" style="s2">believe it&#39;s I believe this is correct</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:06.210" style="s2">although it might not be where Christ</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.200" end="00:35:08.549" style="s2">tells his disciples to pluck out their</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.210" end="00:35:12.359" style="s2">eye if it offends them seems like a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.549" end="00:35:14.309" style="s2">dramatic you know piece of advice but</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.359" end="00:35:17.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s partaking of the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.309" end="00:35:19.019" style="s2">which is that now if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.130" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">holding you back we&#39;ll see this when we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.019" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">get to the story of law - if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:26.099" style="s2">something holding you back even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.470" end="00:35:28.019" style="s2">beer to you you have to let it go you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.099" end="00:35:29.910" style="s2">seriously have to let it go because</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.019" end="00:35:33.390" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything more important than</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.910" end="00:35:35.420" style="s2">progressing forward and cheap sympathy</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.850" end="00:35:43.020" style="s2">none of that will work because the</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.020" end="00:35:50.280" style="s2">together immediately are dire and</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.360" style="s2">miraculous story in some sense right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.160" end="00:36:59.790" style="s2">because well Sarah</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.360" end="00:37:01.560" style="s2">it&#39;s what the Isaac want or what Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.790" end="00:37:03.330" style="s2">wants most is to have a son but it looks</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.560" end="00:37:05.370" style="s2">like it&#39;s pretty much impossible and I I</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.330" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">think what the story is attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.370" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">indicate is something like god only</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:15.600" style="s2">knows what will happen to you if you put</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:18.330" style="s2">your house in order certainly things</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.600" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">that you do not currently regard as</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.330" end="00:37:24.420" style="s2">possible will happen and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.370" style="s2">put your house in order the more things</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.420" end="00:37:30.060" style="s2">that you regard as impossible will</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.370" end="00:37:31.800" style="s2">happen and it might be the case that if</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.060" end="00:37:34.230" style="s2">you put your host together sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.800" end="00:37:37.080" style="s2">things that were of miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.230" end="00:37:38.730" style="s2">impossibility would happen to you well</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.080" end="00:37:41.070" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way of knowing until you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.730" end="00:37:43.800" style="s2">try it but there&#39;s no way of being sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.070" end="00:37:47.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s not the case unless you do and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.800" end="00:37:51.820" style="s2">my experience has been that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.840" end="00:37:54.650" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean just personally I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.820" end="00:37:57.860" style="s2">the world is a remarkable and mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.650" end="00:37:59.510" style="s2">place and the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.860" end="00:38:01.850" style="s2">nature and structure of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.510" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">your actions is indeterminate they may</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.850" end="00:38:05.750" style="s2">be more tightly related than you think</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:08.840" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know how to square that with</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.750" end="00:38:12.350" style="s2">the fact that well you&#39;re obviously in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.840" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">mortal body and constrained by all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.350" end="00:38:22.220" style="s2">of serious constraints and none of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">none of that can be trivially overcome</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.220" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">and I don&#39;t really understand how there</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:29.510" style="s2">can be that seriousness of mortal</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">constraint and the infinite potential</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.510" end="00:38:33.950" style="s2">that also seems to characterize human</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:35.420" style="s2">beings all at the same time but then I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.950" end="00:38:37.340" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand anything about</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.420" end="00:38:42.170" style="s2">the nature of reality so that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.340" end="00:38:44.090" style="s2">more mystery to add to the pile so but</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:46.100" style="s2">my covenant I will establish his Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.090" end="00:38:48.230" style="s2">which share a Sarah shall bear unto thee</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.100" end="00:38:50.030" style="s2">at the set time next year and he left</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.230" end="00:38:51.830" style="s2">off talking with him and God went up</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.030" end="00:38:53.720" style="s2">from Abraham and Abraham took Ishmael</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.830" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">his son and all that were born in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.720" end="00:38:56.840" style="s2">house and all that were bought with his</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:58.730" style="s2">money every male among the men of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.840" end="00:39:00.230" style="s2">Abraham&#39;s house and circumcised the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.730" end="00:39:03.020" style="s2">flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.230" end="00:39:04.850" style="s2">as God had said unto him that must have</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.020" end="00:39:09.680" style="s2">been an interesting conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.850" end="00:39:15.140" style="s2">I mean really this is what God told you</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.680" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2">to do it like okay and Abraham was</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.140" end="00:39:19.340" style="s2">ninety years old and nine when he was</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.340" end="00:39:23.900" style="s2">and Ishmael was thirteen years old when</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:26.210" style="s2">he was circumcised in the cell same day</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.900" end="00:39:27.350" style="s2">was Abraham circumcised and his son and</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.210" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">all the men of his house</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.350" end="00:39:30.830" style="s2">ORN in the house and bought with money</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:35.180" style="s2">of the stranger were circumcised with</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.830" end="00:39:36.770" style="s2">him all right so that&#39;s the renewal of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.180" end="00:39:38.570" style="s2">the Covenant that&#39;s the next part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.770" end="00:39:40.850" style="s2">story that&#39;s the circumcision that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.570" end="00:39:43.150" style="s2">circumcision story and as I said it</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.850" end="00:39:46.100" style="s2">seems to indicate to me something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.150" end="00:39:49.610" style="s2">seriousness of intent something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.100" end="00:39:51.500" style="s2">the responsibility that Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.610" end="00:39:54.440" style="s2">determines to take for everyone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.500" end="00:39:56.300" style="s2">part of his household the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.440" end="00:39:59.960" style="s2">increasing psychological transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.300" end="00:40:01.640" style="s2">of the idea of sacrifice the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.960" end="00:40:05.150" style="s2">of doing something memorable</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.640" end="00:40:09.290" style="s2">and the the what would you call it the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.150" end="00:40:11.750" style="s2">end the utility of rekindling the aims</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.290" end="00:40:13.940" style="s2">of your highest values when you come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.750" end="00:40:16.340" style="s2">the end of an epoch in your life when</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.940" end="00:40:17.990" style="s2">you have to take stock again right you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.340" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">take stock of yourself that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.990" end="00:40:21.560" style="s2">what that phrase means to take stock is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:24.920" style="s2">to take stock of yourself and to decide</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.560" end="00:40:27.470" style="s2">ok well what should move forward in time</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.920" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">with me and what should be let go as if</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.470" end="00:40:32.510" style="s2">it&#39;s Deadwood and the more Deadwood that</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:34.220" style="s2">you let go of and burn off when you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.510" end="00:40:35.660" style="s2">the opportunity the less it accretes</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.220" end="00:40:38.390" style="s2">around you here&#39;s something interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.660" end="00:40:40.070" style="s2">about forest fires you know people have</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.390" end="00:40:41.840" style="s2">been trying to prevent forest fires for</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.070" end="00:40:43.550" style="s2">a long time especially that damn bear</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.840" end="00:40:44.300" style="s2">smokey right he&#39;s trying to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.550" end="00:40:47.690" style="s2">forest fires</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.300" end="00:40:49.790" style="s2">and so because forest fires burn up the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.690" end="00:40:52.130" style="s2">forest and that can&#39;t be good but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.790" end="00:40:54.470" style="s2">what happens if you don&#39;t let forest</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.130" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">fires burn is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.470" end="00:40:59.480" style="s2">well forests collect a lot of dry</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:03.350" style="s2">branches right because tree branches guy</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.480" end="00:41:06.050" style="s2">and wood falls on the forest floor and</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.350" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">collects and so the amount of flammable</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.050" end="00:41:12.830" style="s2">material keeps increasing with time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:14.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not so bad if it&#39;s wet but if the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.830" end="00:41:16.430" style="s2">amount of flammable material is</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.360" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">increasing and it gets really dry and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.430" end="00:41:21.890" style="s2">then it burns then you have a real</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:24.950" style="s2">problem the forest fire can burn so hot</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.890" end="00:41:27.350" style="s2">that it burns root does pop soil right</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.950" end="00:41:28.730" style="s2">off in which case you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.350" end="00:41:31.940" style="s2">forest at all anymore you just have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.730" end="00:41:33.740" style="s2">desert and lots of trees are evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.940" end="00:41:36.410" style="s2">withstand forest fires of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.740" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">intensity and some won&#39;t even release</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.410" end="00:41:41.600" style="s2">their seeds unless there&#39;s been a fire</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:44.330" style="s2">and so a little bit of fire at the right</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.600" end="00:41:46.400" style="s2">time can stop everything from burning to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.330" end="00:41:49.610" style="s2">the ground and that&#39;s also a really</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.400" end="00:41:52.130" style="s2">useful insight a metaphorical insight</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.610" end="00:41:53.960" style="s2">into the nature of sacrifice right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.130" end="00:41:55.940" style="s2">also a lot easier to let go of something</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.960" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">when you&#39;re deciding to let go of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.940" end="00:41:59.720" style="s2">because you&#39;ve decided yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:02.570" style="s2">it&#39;s you&#39;re done with that it&#39;s a weak</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.720" end="00:42:04.730" style="s2">part of you it needs to disappear you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.570" end="00:42:06.920" style="s2">that yourself it&#39;s much better and much</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.730" end="00:42:08.570" style="s2">easier than it is if it&#39;s taken away</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.920" end="00:42:11.660" style="s2">from you forcibly in which case you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.570" end="00:42:13.760" style="s2">very much likely to fight it these other</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.660" end="00:42:15.330" style="s2">there&#39;s another interesting thing here a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.760" end="00:42:16.770" style="s2">motif that runs</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.330" end="00:42:18.600" style="s2">the entire Bible it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.770" end="00:42:20.370" style="s2">powerful motif and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.600" end="00:42:24.120" style="s2">associated with this idea of walking</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.370" end="00:42:25.950" style="s2">with or walking before God and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.120" end="00:42:28.380" style="s2">in the New Testament Christ says</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.950" end="00:42:30.900" style="s2">something like thy father&#39;s will be done</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.380" end="00:42:35.610" style="s2">and he means that that will should be</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.900" end="00:42:37.050" style="s2">done through him and so I can&#39;t I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.610" end="00:42:39.000" style="s2">build a state that&#39;s exactly right but</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.050" end="00:42:40.860" style="s2">it&#39;s something like this you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.000" end="00:42:43.560" style="s2">of what people regard as their own</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.860" end="00:42:45.480" style="s2">personalities and and are proud of about</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.560" end="00:42:48.440" style="s2">their own personalities aren&#39;t their own</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.480" end="00:42:51.800" style="s2">personalities at all they&#39;re useless</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.440" end="00:42:53.970" style="s2">idiosyncrasies that differ them</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.800" end="00:42:56.130" style="s2">differentiate them trivially from other</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.970" end="00:42:58.080" style="s2">people but they have no value in and of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.130" end="00:43:00.510" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re more like quirks I</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.080" end="00:43:04.200" style="s2">remember once I was trying to teach a</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.510" end="00:43:07.560" style="s2">particularly stubborn student about how</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.200" end="00:43:10.200" style="s2">to write and she had written a number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.560" end="00:43:12.840" style="s2">essays in in University and got</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.200" end="00:43:14.040" style="s2">universally walloped for them and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.840" end="00:43:17.010" style="s2">reason for that was she couldn&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.040" end="00:43:19.770" style="s2">really at all she was really really bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.010" end="00:43:22.950" style="s2">at writing and so I was sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.770" end="00:43:26.460" style="s2">with her trying to explain to her what</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.950" end="00:43:28.440" style="s2">she was doing wrong and she was being</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.460" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">very annoying about it very recalcitrant</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.440" end="00:43:33.140" style="s2">very very unwilling to listen that was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:36.060" style="s2">pearls before swine thing you know and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.140" end="00:43:37.530" style="s2">at one point she said it I can write</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.060" end="00:43:39.540" style="s2">perfectly well this university</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.530" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">professors just don&#39;t like my style and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.540" end="00:43:48.180" style="s2">I could see all my hands creep towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:50.940" style="s2">her neck yeah well then I&#39;d be funny if</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.180" end="00:43:52.350" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t true but was also true you</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.940" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">know and I thought what the hell&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.350" end="00:43:57.660" style="s2">you you can&#39;t even write and you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:59.900" style="s2">you have a style and normally do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.660" end="00:43:59.900" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.140" end="00:44:07.980" style="s2">ya know not knowing how to write is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.030" end="00:44:11.790" style="s2">a style that&#39;s the other point right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.980" end="00:44:13.710" style="s2">so you know she she instead of humbling</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.790" end="00:44:15.060" style="s2">herself which was necessary and okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.710" end="00:44:16.200" style="s2">right cuz she was a new University</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.060" end="00:44:17.370" style="s2">students like of course you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.200" end="00:44:27.600" style="s2">how to write when were you gonna learn</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.370" end="00:44:30.120" style="s2">in school I don&#39;t think so so she had</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.600" end="00:44:32.100" style="s2">this you know this this this style issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.120" end="00:44:35.100" style="s2">and it it just it just didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.100" end="00:44:36.510" style="s2">anywhere at all and so now let&#39;s see I</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.100" end="00:44:40.560" style="s2">lost my train of thought and telling you</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.510" end="00:44:42.930" style="s2">tell me all those jokes oh yes in terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.560" end="00:44:44.460" style="s2">of above letting things burn off yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.930" end="00:44:46.590" style="s2">well so she was proud of her</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.460" end="00:44:48.450" style="s2">insufficiency that&#39;s arrogance right</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.590" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not humility it&#39;s self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.450" end="00:44:51.510" style="s2">and arrogance to be proud of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">insufficiency that&#39;s a very foolish</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.510" end="00:44:54.930" style="s2">thing and that means to cling to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:57.150" style="s2">parts of you that are dead</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.930" end="00:44:59.580" style="s2">okay now there&#39;s this idea that runs</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.150" end="00:45:05.850" style="s2">through the Bible I think as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.580" end="00:45:07.890" style="s2">that okay I&#39;ll tell you another little</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.850" end="00:45:09.740" style="s2">side story here I was reading about</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.890" end="00:45:13.260" style="s2">Socrates today and I was reading about</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.740" end="00:45:16.770" style="s2">Socrates trial you know he was tried by</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.260" end="00:45:18.570" style="s2">the Athenians for corrupting for failing</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.770" end="00:45:20.580" style="s2">to worship the correct gods and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.570" end="00:45:22.200" style="s2">corrupting the youth of Athens by like</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.580" end="00:45:23.940" style="s2">teaching them stuff and asking them</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.200" end="00:45:28.260" style="s2">questions you know which is great way to</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.940" end="00:45:31.470" style="s2">corrupt people and so he knew the trial</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.260" end="00:45:33.180" style="s2">was coming and Athens wasn&#39;t a very big</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.470" end="00:45:34.860" style="s2">place only on about 25,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.180" end="00:45:36.870" style="s2">everybody knew everybody everybody knew</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.860" end="00:45:40.080" style="s2">who the powerful guys were and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.870" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">including Socrates knew that the trial</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.080" end="00:45:43.590" style="s2">was a warning</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:45.240" style="s2">do you like get out of town right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.590" end="00:45:49.290" style="s2">going to put you on trial in six months</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.240" end="00:45:53.190" style="s2">and the potential penalty is best got</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.290" end="00:45:55.770" style="s2">that it&#39;s like so so Socrates had a chat</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.190" end="00:45:59.010" style="s2">with his compatriots and they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.770" end="00:46:01.170" style="s2">contemplating fair means and foul to set</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.010" end="00:46:03.450" style="s2">up a defense for him so that he could or</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.170" end="00:46:07.650" style="s2">to leave so that he could not be tried</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.450" end="00:46:09.270" style="s2">and put to death and he decided that he</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.650" end="00:46:11.910" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to do that and he also</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.270" end="00:46:12.570" style="s2">decided that he wasn&#39;t going to even</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.910" end="00:46:15.840" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.570" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">his defense and he said why this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.840" end="00:46:22.200" style="s2">quite an interesting thing he said why</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:24.600" style="s2">he told one of his friends that he had</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.200" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">this voice in his head</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.600" end="00:46:31.350" style="s2">a daemon a spirit something like that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.610" style="s2">that he always listened to and that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.350" end="00:46:33.660" style="s2">was one of the reasons he was different</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.610" end="00:46:35.010" style="s2">from other people because he always</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.660" end="00:46:36.330" style="s2">listened to this thing it didn&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.010" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">him what to do but it told him what not</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.330" end="00:46:40.470" style="s2">to do it always told him what not to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:42.090" style="s2">and if it told him not to do something</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.470" end="00:46:45.380" style="s2">then he didn&#39;t do it if he was speaking</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.090" end="00:46:47.880" style="s2">and the little voice came up and said no</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.380" end="00:46:49.710" style="s2">then he shut up and he tried to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.880" end="00:46:51.300" style="s2">something else and he was very emphatic</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.710" end="00:46:55.560" style="s2">about this and he said that when he</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.300" end="00:46:58.380" style="s2">tried to plan to evade the trial or even</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.560" end="00:47:02.700" style="s2">to mount his own defence the voice came</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.380" end="00:47:05.670" style="s2">up and said no don&#39;t bother with it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.700" end="00:47:07.770" style="s2">he thought well what would he what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.670" end="00:47:09.780" style="s2">hell do you mean by that like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.770" end="00:47:12.390" style="s2">trial coming and I&#39;m going to be put to</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.780" end="00:47:16.320" style="s2">death and well he eventually concluded</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.390" end="00:47:18.450" style="s2">that he was an old guy you know the next</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.320" end="00:47:19.800" style="s2">10 years he was in his 70s perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.450" end="00:47:22.830" style="s2">next 10 years weren&#39;t going to be that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.800" end="00:47:24.180" style="s2">great for him he got a chance maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.830" end="00:47:26.190" style="s2">gods were giving him a chance just to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.180" end="00:47:27.810" style="s2">bow out you know to put his affairs in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.190" end="00:47:30.840" style="s2">order to say goodbye to everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.810" end="00:47:32.100" style="s2">avoid that last descent into catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.840" end="00:47:34.020" style="s2">which might have been particularly</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.100" end="00:47:37.820" style="s2">painful for a philosopher and to and to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.020" end="00:47:43.260" style="s2">walk off the world on his own terms</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.820" end="00:47:45.780" style="s2">something like that the point I&#39;m making</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.260" end="00:47:47.940" style="s2">with that is that Socrates attended to</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.780" end="00:47:50.040" style="s2">this internal voice that at least told</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.940" end="00:47:51.570" style="s2">him what not to do and then he didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.040" end="00:47:53.130" style="s2">it and of course Socrates was a very</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.570" end="00:47:54.750" style="s2">remarkable man and we still hear about</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.130" end="00:47:57.570" style="s2">him today and we know that he existed</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.750" end="00:48:02.390" style="s2">and all of those things and so back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.570" end="00:48:08.450" style="s2">the back to the walking with God idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.390" end="00:48:08.450" style="s2">you know as you elevate your aim you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.930" end="00:48:14.370" style="s2">create a judge at the same time right</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.610" end="00:48:16.950" style="s2">because the new ideal which is an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.370" end="00:48:18.420" style="s2">you even if it&#39;s just an ideal position</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.950" end="00:48:20.700" style="s2">that you might occupy even if it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.420" end="00:48:23.160" style="s2">conceptualized in that concrete way that</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.700" end="00:48:25.620" style="s2">becomes a judge because it&#39;s above you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.160" end="00:48:26.789" style="s2">right and then you&#39;re you&#39;re terrified</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.620" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">of it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.789" end="00:48:29.999" style="s2">why you might be afraid when you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:31.559" style="s2">start a new job right because your this</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.999" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">thing is above you and you&#39;re terrified</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.559" end="00:48:36.509" style="s2">of it and it judges you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:38.459" style="s2">useful because that&#39;s the judge that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.509" end="00:48:41.189" style="s2">you&#39;re creating by formulating the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.459" end="00:48:43.439" style="s2">tells you what&#39;s useless about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.189" end="00:48:45.509" style="s2">and then you can dispense with it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.439" end="00:48:47.189" style="s2">you want to keep doing that and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.509" end="00:48:48.989" style="s2">every time you make a judge that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.189" end="00:48:51.089" style="s2">elevated then there&#39;s more useless you</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.989" end="00:48:53.849" style="s2">that has to be dispensed with and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.089" end="00:48:55.919" style="s2">if you recreate an ultimate judge which</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.849" end="00:48:58.469" style="s2">is what the archetypal imagination of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.919" end="00:49:00.390" style="s2">humankind has done say with the figure</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.469" end="00:49:02.309" style="s2">of Christ because if Christ is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.390" end="00:49:05.160" style="s2">else he is at least the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.309" end="00:49:06.749" style="s2">perfect man and therefore the judge you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.160" end="00:49:08.999" style="s2">have a judge that says get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.749" end="00:49:10.619" style="s2">everything about yourself that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.999" end="00:49:12.179" style="s2">perfect of course that&#39;s also what</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.619" end="00:49:15.029" style="s2">Abraham that&#39;s also what God tells</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.179" end="00:49:17.489" style="s2">Abraham right he says to be perfect to</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.029" end="00:49:18.900" style="s2">pick an ideal that&#39;s high enough and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.489" end="00:49:20.789" style="s2">can do this the thing that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.900" end="00:49:22.650" style="s2">about this I think is you can do it more</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.789" end="00:49:24.660" style="s2">or less on your own terms you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.650" end="00:49:26.459" style="s2">have some collaboration from other</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.660" end="00:49:28.259" style="s2">people but you don&#39;t have to pick an</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.459" end="00:49:30.539" style="s2">external ideal you can pick an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.259" end="00:49:33.449" style="s2">that fulfills the role of ideal for you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.539" end="00:49:35.400" style="s2">you can say okay well if things could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.449" end="00:49:37.349" style="s2">set up for me the way I need them to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.400" end="00:49:40.380" style="s2">and if I could be who I needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.349" end="00:49:41.609" style="s2">what would that look like and you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.380" end="00:49:43.019" style="s2">figure that out for yourself and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.609" end="00:49:44.069" style="s2">instantly you have a judge and I also</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.019" end="00:49:46.439" style="s2">think that&#39;s part of the reason people</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.069" end="00:49:49.259" style="s2">don&#39;t do it right why don&#39;t why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.439" end="00:49:51.449" style="s2">people look up and move ahead an answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.259" end="00:49:53.400" style="s2">is well you know you start formulating</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.449" end="00:49:55.499" style="s2">an ideal you formulate a judge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.400" end="00:49:57.299" style="s2">pretty easy to feel intimidated in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.499" end="00:49:59.789" style="s2">face of your own ideal that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.299" end="00:50:01.650" style="s2">happens to Kane vs Abel for example then</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.789" end="00:50:03.299" style="s2">it&#39;s really easy to destroy the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.650" end="00:50:05.640" style="s2">instead of to try to pursue it because</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.299" end="00:50:08.459" style="s2">then you get rid of the judge but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.640" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">way better lower the damn judge if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.459" end="00:50:12.509" style="s2">too much like if your current ambition</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:14.099" style="s2">is crushing you you know then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.509" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">you&#39;re playing the tyrant to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.099" end="00:50:18.059" style="s2">and you should cap down your ambitions</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:19.769" style="s2">not get rid of them by any stretch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.059" end="00:50:22.499" style="s2">the imagination but at least put them</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.769" end="00:50:23.939" style="s2">more reasonably within your grasp you</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.499" end="00:50:26.489" style="s2">don&#39;t have to leap from point one to</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.939" end="00:50:28.829" style="s2">point 50 and one leap right you can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.489" end="00:50:31.459" style="s2">it incrementally but I really like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.829" end="00:50:35.009" style="s2">idea I think it&#39;s a profound idea that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.459" end="00:50:37.679" style="s2">the process of recapitulating yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.009" end="00:50:39.599" style="s2">continually is also the process of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.679" end="00:50:40.290" style="s2">a phoenix-like process right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:42.150" style="s2">shedding</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.290" end="00:50:44.310" style="s2">and all those elements of you that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.150" end="00:50:48.180" style="s2">no longer worthy of the pursuits that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.310" end="00:50:51.030" style="s2">you&#39;re that you&#39;re valuing and then I</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.180" end="00:50:54.650" style="s2">would say the idea here is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.030" end="00:50:57.930" style="s2">do that you shape yourself ever more</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.650" end="00:51:00.180" style="s2">precisely into something that can</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.930" end="00:51:03.570" style="s2">withstand the tragedy of life and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.180" end="00:51:04.890" style="s2">can act as a as a beacon to the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.570" end="00:51:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.890" end="00:51:08.790" style="s2">it maybe first to your friends and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.960" end="00:51:10.740" style="s2">to your family it&#39;s like it&#39;s a hell of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.790" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">a fine ambition and there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.740" end="00:51:15.030" style="s2">that it can&#39;t happen you know every one</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:16.830" style="s2">of you knows people who are really</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.030" end="00:51:18.900" style="s2">bloody useful in a crisis and people</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.830" end="00:51:20.340" style="s2">that you admire right those are all you</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.900" end="00:51:22.560" style="s2">can think of all those people as you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.340" end="00:51:25.740" style="s2">admire that you admire us partial</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.560" end="00:51:27.510" style="s2">incarnations of the archetypal Messiah</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.740" end="00:51:30.060" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.510" end="00:51:32.250" style="s2">and the more that that manifests itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.060" end="00:51:34.320" style="s2">at any given person then the more</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.250" end="00:51:36.750" style="s2">generally useful and admirable that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.320" end="00:51:38.850" style="s2">person is in a multitude of situations</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.750" end="00:51:40.950" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know the limit to that but</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.850" end="00:51:43.230" style="s2">people can be unbelievably good for</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.950" end="00:51:46.790" style="s2">things you know it&#39;s really something to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.230" end="00:51:49.890" style="s2">behold so that&#39;s what God tells Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.790" end="00:51:51.720" style="s2">okay so the next story is about Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.890" end="00:51:53.490" style="s2">and these angels Ames will show up on</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.720" end="00:51:55.800" style="s2">his doorstep and this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.490" end="00:51:58.710" style="s2">story of Sodom and Gomorrah but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.800" end="00:52:01.350" style="s2">think as I said this story is generally</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.710" end="00:52:03.090" style="s2">read as if it&#39;s about homosexuality but</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.350" end="00:52:08.160" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it is here I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.090" end="00:52:10.280" style="s2">about two things primarily one is how do</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.160" end="00:52:12.990" style="s2">you treat the strange</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.280" end="00:52:15.420" style="s2">so the strangest strange things and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.990" end="00:52:17.370" style="s2">strange ideas and strange people and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.420" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">strangers right it&#39;s all about it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.370" end="00:52:22.050" style="s2">that which is not you it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:25.170" style="s2">strange lands that God asked Abraham to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.050" end="00:52:28.080" style="s2">move out into how do you interact with</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.170" end="00:52:30.450" style="s2">this strange and here here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.080" end="00:52:33.090" style="s2">possible rule because you could say to</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.450" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">yourself well what what do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.090" end="00:52:36.750" style="s2">make friends with more where do I want</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:38.370" style="s2">to be more comfortable do I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.750" end="00:52:40.830" style="s2">more comfortable with that which I</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.370" end="00:52:42.330" style="s2">already know and so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.830" end="00:52:44.370" style="s2">circumscribed territory that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.330" end="00:52:46.560" style="s2">already mastered or do I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.370" end="00:52:50.100" style="s2">comfortable with all those things I</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.560" end="00:52:51.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know and then the right answer is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.100" end="00:52:52.620" style="s2">that you should want to be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.450" end="00:52:53.880" style="s2">with all those things that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.620" end="00:52:55.650" style="s2">know because there is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.880" end="00:52:58.560" style="s2">bloody lot of things that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.650" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">and if you can be a Sojourner among what</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.560" end="00:53:02.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t know well then you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:04.230" style="s2">protected because well you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.790" end="00:53:05.610" style="s2">go lots of places where you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.230" end="00:53:07.290" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to be able to manage it</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.610" end="00:53:09.630" style="s2">so you want to be you want to be that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.290" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">person that can act where they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.630" end="00:53:19.080" style="s2">know and so also what happens with with</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:24.150" style="s2">Abraham well he&#39;s at home and these</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.080" end="00:53:26.220" style="s2">angels show up now we don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.150" end="00:53:29.370" style="s2">they&#39;re angels or men precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.220" end="00:53:31.050" style="s2">well as this part of the story reads as</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.370" end="00:53:33.210" style="s2">the Lord appeared to him in the plains</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.050" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.210" end="00:53:36.990" style="s2">the heat of the day so he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:38.820" style="s2">visionary state by the by all</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.990" end="00:53:40.860" style="s2">appearances and he lifted up his eyes</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.820" end="00:53:42.780" style="s2">and looked and lo three men stood by him</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.860" end="00:53:45.210" style="s2">there&#39;s real ambivalence in the story</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.780" end="00:53:47.190" style="s2">about the men are the three men are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.210" end="00:53:50.370" style="s2">three angels are the two angels in God</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.190" end="00:53:52.140" style="s2">it&#39;s all mixed up in the story so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.370" end="00:53:54.090" style="s2">won&#39;t clarify that we&#39;ll leave it</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.140" end="00:53:55.950" style="s2">ambiguous and I think the ambiguity is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.090" end="00:53:58.310" style="s2">important because you don&#39;t know who the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.950" end="00:54:00.420" style="s2">stranger is when you encounter them and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.310" end="00:54:04.170" style="s2">it depends on whether you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.420" end="00:54:05.040" style="s2">about it in the normative manner or if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.170" end="00:54:07.170" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.040" end="00:54:08.850" style="s2">transcendent manner because with each</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.170" end="00:54:10.590" style="s2">person that you meet well they&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.850" end="00:54:12.480" style="s2">person that&#39;s one way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.590" end="00:54:15.450" style="s2">it and and then they&#39;re the person that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.480" end="00:54:17.640" style="s2">you know or they&#39;re the person as they</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.450" end="00:54:19.740" style="s2">choose to reveal themselves to you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.640" end="00:54:21.480" style="s2">people keep themselves shielded but then</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.740" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">they&#39;re also something of great</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.480" end="00:54:26.580" style="s2">metaphysical potential right and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:29.370" style="s2">might say well do you believe that and I</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.580" end="00:54:30.810" style="s2">would say well yes you believe it</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.370" end="00:54:32.610" style="s2">because you expect a lot from people</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.810" end="00:54:35.340" style="s2">generally speaking and are not happy if</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.610" end="00:54:37.080" style="s2">they betray you but more importantly our</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.340" end="00:54:39.660" style="s2">entire culture is predicated on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.080" end="00:54:41.640" style="s2">that each person has an indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.660" end="00:54:43.670" style="s2">intrinsic worth and I&#39;m not talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.640" end="00:54:47.100" style="s2">about self-esteem I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.670" end="00:54:49.830" style="s2">something like the what would what would</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.100" end="00:54:52.020" style="s2">you say it the implicit presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.830" end="00:54:53.790" style="s2">in our legal structure that no matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.020" end="00:54:56.580" style="s2">who you are even if you&#39;re a murderer</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.790" end="00:54:58.590" style="s2">even if you&#39;re a condemned murderer that</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.580" end="00:55:00.570" style="s2">there&#39;s something about you that&#39;s of</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.010" end="00:55:12.700" style="s2">well yak it out because you follow the</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.080" end="00:55:23.830" style="s2">down and I think the whole idea that you</p>

<p begin="00:55:23.830" end="00:55:29.560" style="s2">predicated on something like the</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.360" end="00:56:28.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t what happens in the West which</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.830" end="00:56:30.390" style="s2">isn&#39;t an absolutely amazing thing so</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.510" end="00:56:33.700" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.390" end="00:56:37.240" style="s2">Abraham is a master of the stranger</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.700" end="00:56:40.090" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it he</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.240" end="00:56:43.390" style="s2">knows what to do when strangers come</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.090" end="00:56:45.850" style="s2">along and he opens his he opens himself</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.390" end="00:56:48.340" style="s2">up to them and I would say he does that</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.850" end="00:56:50.830" style="s2">we know he&#39;s not a naive guy Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.340" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">right he&#39;s no weakling a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.830" end="00:56:55.450" style="s2">stories ago he took a big army and you</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:58.360" style="s2">know went and harassed a bunch of Kings</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.450" end="00:56:58.990" style="s2">and took his nephew back he&#39;s he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.360" end="00:57:01.840" style="s2">tough guy</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.990" end="00:57:04.750" style="s2">and so if strangers show up and he</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.840" end="00:57:06.790" style="s2">welcomes them it&#39;s not because he</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.750" end="00:57:08.560" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do otherwise he could certainly</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.790" end="00:57:10.540" style="s2">do otherwise and it&#39;s not because he</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.560" end="00:57:12.340" style="s2">isn&#39;t aware of what people can be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.540" end="00:57:14.350" style="s2">he&#39;s perfectly aware of what people can</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.340" end="00:57:16.330" style="s2">be like but he determines to take a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.350" end="00:57:19.180" style="s2">particular attitude towards them and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.330" end="00:57:20.620" style="s2">that is to welcome them and so and why</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.180" end="00:57:24.460" style="s2">would you do that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.620" end="00:57:27.610" style="s2">the answer to that is you hold out your</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.460" end="00:57:30.820" style="s2">hand entrust to someone and you evoke</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.610" end="00:57:33.550" style="s2">the best from them if that&#39;s their to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.820" end="00:57:35.950" style="s2">given so it&#39;s an act of courage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.550" end="00:57:39.010" style="s2">like it&#39;s it isn&#39;t me meeting you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.950" end="00:57:42.340" style="s2">exactly not exactly it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.010" end="00:57:44.260" style="s2">transcendent part of me making a gesture</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.340" end="00:57:46.270" style="s2">that allows the transcendent part of you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.260" end="00:57:48.220" style="s2">to step forward and that happens all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.270" end="00:57:50.500" style="s2">time it happens all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.220" end="00:57:52.540" style="s2">normative discourse you know this</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.500" end="00:57:54.130" style="s2">perfectly well because sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.540" end="00:57:55.510" style="s2">have a real casual conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.130" end="00:57:57.970" style="s2">someone that just goes nowhere right</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.510" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just shallow as can be or now and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.970" end="00:58:01.930" style="s2">then you can actually make contact with</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:03.580" style="s2">someone right and you&#39;re both I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.930" end="00:58:05.740" style="s2">say enlightened and ennoble by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.580" end="00:58:08.440" style="s2">conversation and that&#39;s a de we would</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.740" end="00:58:10.180" style="s2">call that a deep conversation first for</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.440" end="00:58:13.480" style="s2">some reason because we made a deep</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.180" end="00:58:14.680" style="s2">connection whatever that means it means</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.480" end="00:58:16.690" style="s2">well it certainly means that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.680" end="00:58:18.670" style="s2">shallow we&#39;re not sure about what these</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.690" end="00:58:20.110" style="s2">metaphor means but it means that it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.670" end="00:58:21.580" style="s2">reaches deep inside of you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.110" end="00:58:24.250" style="s2">something like that you make direct</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.580" end="00:58:28.810" style="s2">person-to-person contact and those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.250" end="00:58:30.520" style="s2">of conversations are replenishing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.810" end="00:58:32.290" style="s2">that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.520" end="00:58:35.830" style="s2">they genuinely are and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.290" end="00:58:38.410" style="s2">because they provide you with that bread</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.830" end="00:58:40.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not Material bread and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.410" end="00:58:44.320" style="s2">information that you need to to thrive</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.840" end="00:58:45.970" style="s2">and to put yourself together and so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.320" end="00:58:47.590" style="s2">does matter how you meet someone and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.970" end="00:58:49.960" style="s2">does matter how you treat them when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.590" end="00:58:51.640" style="s2">first meet them and it&#39;s amazing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.960" end="00:58:53.230" style="s2">learned to do this at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.640" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">partly because I&#39;m a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.230" end="00:58:56.620" style="s2">psychologist I&#39;ve learned how to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:58.600" style="s2">people very rapidly and I have the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.620" end="00:59:00.970" style="s2">amazing adventures with people in cabs</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.600" end="00:59:02.560" style="s2">and when I travel because I&#39;ll talk to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.970" end="00:59:04.540" style="s2">them directly right away and they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.560" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">tell me the wildest stories and show me</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.540" end="00:59:08.470" style="s2">the craziest things because I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:11.260" style="s2">interested in what they have to say and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.470" end="00:59:13.780" style="s2">I&#39;m not afraid well I&#39;m somewhat afraid</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.260" end="00:59:16.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sufficiently afraid</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.780" end="00:59:20.170" style="s2">to have that stop me and I&#39;m acting on</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.210" end="00:59:21.850" style="s2">the presupposition that the person has</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.170" end="00:59:24.100" style="s2">something of great interest to reveal</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.850" end="00:59:25.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very useful thing to know</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.100" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">too because one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.780" end="00:59:28.870" style="s2">really cool about people and you really</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.040" style="s2">learn this as the clinical psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.870" end="00:59:31.930" style="s2">is that if you can get people talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.040" end="00:59:33.130" style="s2">they&#39;re so damn interesting you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.930" end="00:59:34.750" style="s2">hardly stand it</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.130" end="00:59:36.850" style="s2">you know because they have</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.750" end="00:59:38.530" style="s2">these idiosyncratic experiences that are</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.850" end="00:59:40.090" style="s2">only theirs right they&#39;re only theirs</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.530" end="00:59:41.620" style="s2">personally no one else could tell the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.090" end="00:59:43.240" style="s2">story and that&#39;s the kind of stories</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.620" end="00:59:44.500" style="s2">that you want to hear and when they tell</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.240" end="00:59:46.540" style="s2">you those stories you learn something</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.500" end="00:59:48.340" style="s2">you didn&#39;t know and so what that means</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.540" end="00:59:51.670" style="s2">is that you can treat the landscape of</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.340" end="00:59:54.280" style="s2">strangers as an endless vista of places</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.670" end="00:59:55.930" style="s2">to learn things you didn&#39;t know and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.280" end="00:59:58.840" style="s2">you know enough so that you&#39;re satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.930" end="01:00:01.030" style="s2">with your life and everything has ceased</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.840" end="01:00:02.610" style="s2">to be a tragedy around you well then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.030" end="01:00:06.130" style="s2">could be comfortable in your</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.610" end="01:00:08.110" style="s2">circumscribed domain of totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.130" end="01:00:10.330" style="s2">knowledge let&#39;s say but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.110" end="01:00:11.860" style="s2">your life is insufficient and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.330" end="01:00:13.510" style="s2">suffering more than you want to and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.860" end="01:00:15.430" style="s2">everything isn&#39;t what it should be then</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.510" end="01:00:18.100" style="s2">you need to look where you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.430" end="01:00:20.020" style="s2">looked for what you don&#39;t have and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.100" end="01:00:21.640" style="s2">you can look outside beyond you and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.020" end="01:00:24.820" style="s2">you can make friends with what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.640" end="01:00:26.710" style="s2">understand and that&#39;s a huge part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.820" end="01:00:30.070" style="s2">what this story is about because what</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.710" end="01:00:33.220" style="s2">happens is that Abraham welcomes the men</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.070" end="01:00:35.380" style="s2">God angels and treats them very well and</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.220" end="01:00:38.170" style="s2">reaps a tremendous benefit as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.380" end="01:00:40.150" style="s2">consequence and then well then the story</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.170" end="01:00:42.820" style="s2">reverses and we end up in Sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.150" end="01:00:44.800" style="s2">Gomorrah where the same angels sojourn</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.820" end="01:00:46.900" style="s2">and they&#39;re treated terribly and all</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.250" end="01:01:08.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a statement in the New Testament</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.360" end="01:01:10.780" style="s2">Christ says something like when you when</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.590" end="01:01:16.150" style="s2">you do something to the least of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.780" end="01:01:19.630" style="s2">you do it to me him right and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.150" end="01:01:21.570" style="s2">very difficult statement to understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.630" end="01:01:26.890" style="s2">too but it&#39;s something like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.570" end="01:01:28.780" style="s2">something reminiscent of the requirement</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.890" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">to keep the idea of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.780" end="01:01:32.410" style="s2">reality of the person in mind at the</p>

<p begin="01:01:37.900" end="01:01:44.500" style="s2">you&#39;re talking to people you know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.060" end="01:01:46.689" style="s2">learned from a friend of mine in</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.500" end="01:01:48.999" style="s2">Montreal</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.689" end="01:01:50.829" style="s2">who is very socially sophisticated in</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.999" end="01:01:52.900" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.829" end="01:01:54.429" style="s2">whenever went in whenever he went in to</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.900" end="01:01:58.029" style="s2">us always like going shopping with him</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.429" end="01:02:00.309" style="s2">and whenever he went into a store and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.029" end="01:02:02.049" style="s2">talked and he had an interaction with a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.309" end="01:02:03.849" style="s2">clerk the first thing he would do is</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.049" end="01:02:05.559" style="s2">have an interaction with the clerk and</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.849" end="01:02:08.170" style="s2">he wouldn&#39;t have an interaction with the</p>

<p begin="01:02:08.170" end="01:02:11.709" style="s2">person sort of take stock of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.089" end="01:02:14.949" style="s2">that they were there and then asked them</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.709" end="01:02:17.160" style="s2">something genuine about their job or</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.949" end="01:02:20.009" style="s2">their store how they were doing like</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.160" end="01:02:22.239" style="s2">going to a conversation right away and</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.009" end="01:02:23.679" style="s2">he didn&#39;t get personal about it because</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.239" end="01:02:26.589" style="s2">that can be intrusive right you have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.679" end="01:02:30.489" style="s2">be very sophisticated to do this but he</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.589" end="01:02:33.910" style="s2">did indicate to the person that he was</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.489" end="01:02:35.469" style="s2">there at least in part for the good that</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.910" end="01:02:37.420" style="s2">could be done between them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.469" end="01:02:40.299" style="s2">something like that and then the person</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.420" end="01:02:45.099" style="s2">would be ridiculously helpful you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.299" end="01:02:46.420" style="s2">and and so then you know if people</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.099" end="01:02:49.089" style="s2">mistreat you you see this with</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.420" end="01:02:50.949" style="s2">antisocial kids it&#39;s a very tragic thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.089" end="01:02:53.229" style="s2">to see because if you&#39;re an antisocial</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.949" end="01:02:55.299" style="s2">child by the time you&#39;re about 4 you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.229" end="01:02:57.519" style="s2">very hostile and distrustful to people</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.299" end="01:03:00.069" style="s2">and so you&#39;d like a growling puppy and</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.519" end="01:03:01.749" style="s2">if you&#39;re a growling puppy you can not</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.069" end="01:03:03.910" style="s2">to get petted you&#39;re more likely to get</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.749" end="01:03:05.589" style="s2">kicked and if you&#39;re a growling puppy</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.910" end="01:03:07.689" style="s2">and you get kicked and you have even</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.589" end="01:03:09.459" style="s2">more reason to grow and that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.689" end="01:03:11.769" style="s2">the story of antisocial kids if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.459" end="01:03:13.059" style="s2">not well socialized by the time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.769" end="01:03:15.999" style="s2">four and they&#39;re more on the aggressive</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.059" end="01:03:17.709" style="s2">side then they alienate themselves from</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.999" end="01:03:20.049" style="s2">the community and all they get is</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.709" end="01:03:23.709" style="s2">rejection well and then they look at the</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.049" end="01:03:26.319" style="s2">rejection and they think well to hell</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.709" end="01:03:28.660" style="s2">with humanity you know and you wonder</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:31.449" style="s2">they think that but but the part of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.660" end="01:03:34.029" style="s2">catastrophe is is that they get what</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.449" end="01:03:35.859" style="s2">they evoke and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.029" end="01:03:37.809" style="s2">fault precisely but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.859" end="01:03:39.910" style="s2">that&#39;s still what happens and so you</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.809" end="01:03:42.880" style="s2">might ask yourself if you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.910" end="01:03:45.489" style="s2">from people what you need there is some</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.329" end="01:07:21.910" style="s2">like about the existential philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.789" end="01:07:23.740" style="s2">is their emphasis on personal</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.910" end="01:07:26.619" style="s2">responsibility you know that many of</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.740" end="01:07:29.440" style="s2">them had an emphasis on the role that</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.619" end="01:07:31.720" style="s2">people had in shaping their own destiny</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.440" end="01:07:33.730" style="s2">the exists for the existentialists and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.720" end="01:07:36.339" style="s2">think this was a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.730" end="01:07:38.829" style="s2">religious substructure of philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.339" end="01:07:43.029" style="s2">thinking it was self-evident that life</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.829" end="01:07:45.039" style="s2">was tragic and bitter but and then fair</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.029" end="01:07:47.619" style="s2">enough but that isn&#39;t where it ended the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.039" end="01:07:49.720" style="s2">the next issue was well there are better</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.619" end="01:07:51.730" style="s2">in ways better and worse ways of dealing</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.720" end="01:07:53.710" style="s2">with that and the better way of dealing</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.730" end="01:07:58.359" style="s2">with the fact that life is tragic and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.710" end="01:08:00.180" style="s2">bitter is to pause it the self you could</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.359" end="01:08:03.369" style="s2">be and live authentically in</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.180" end="01:08:05.019" style="s2">relationship to that and then the next</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.369" end="01:08:06.670" style="s2">issue and something is something</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.019" end="01:08:08.500" style="s2">Kierkegaard talked about particularly</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.670" end="01:08:10.599" style="s2">when he talked about the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.500" end="01:08:12.940" style="s2">being a night of faith is that the thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.599" end="01:08:15.449" style="s2">is and this is I think part of the light</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.940" end="01:08:18.250" style="s2">part of life that&#39;s the intractable</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.449" end="01:08:20.650" style="s2">adventure no one can take the adventure</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.250" end="01:08:22.839" style="s2">of life away from you that that&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.650" end="01:08:24.940" style="s2">can&#39;t deal with good advice for example</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:26.739" style="s2">because no one can demonstrate to you</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.940" end="01:08:28.389" style="s2">that if you straight</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.739" end="01:08:30.609" style="s2">yourself out a name it what you want and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.389" end="01:08:32.079" style="s2">make the proper sacrifices that your</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.609" end="01:08:33.880" style="s2">life will turn out in the manner that</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.079" end="01:08:36.880" style="s2">you might want it to turn out</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.880" end="01:08:39.069" style="s2">it isn&#39;t in anyone else&#39;s purview to</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.880" end="01:08:42.670" style="s2">make that judgment the only person that</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.069" end="01:08:44.440" style="s2">can possibly figure that out is you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.670" end="01:08:46.029" style="s2">something that can&#39;t be stolen from you</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.440" end="01:08:47.829" style="s2">I would say it&#39;s your destiny it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.029" end="01:08:50.679" style="s2">destiny that cannot be stolen from you</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.829" end="01:08:51.940" style="s2">and you can forego it you can say well</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.679" end="01:08:54.670" style="s2">I&#39;m not willing to put in the effort</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.940" end="01:08:56.199" style="s2">because what if I fail well first of all</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.670" end="01:08:59.949" style="s2">if you don&#39;t put in the effort you will</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.199" end="01:09:02.499" style="s2">fail because life is hard and it takes</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.949" end="01:09:06.789" style="s2">everything out of you to do it properly</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.499" end="01:09:08.920" style="s2">so you will fail and if you make the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.789" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">proper sacrifices you might fail that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.920" end="01:09:11.670" style="s2">why I like the ambiguity and the story</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.480" end="01:09:14.319" style="s2">of Cain and Abel because we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.670" end="01:09:16.539" style="s2">really told why God rejects Cain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.319" end="01:09:18.130" style="s2">offerings there&#39;s hints that Cain maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.539" end="01:09:19.659" style="s2">isn&#39;t doing as good a job as he should</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.130" end="01:09:22.029" style="s2">and he certainly gets bitter about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.659" end="01:09:23.920" style="s2">but there&#39;s no smoking pistol</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.029" end="01:09:26.559" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t say well Cain is a bad guy he</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.920" end="01:09:27.849" style="s2">made terrible sacrifices so God rejected</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.559" end="01:09:29.319" style="s2">him you never know</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.849" end="01:09:30.880" style="s2">Cain might have been working pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.319" end="01:09:33.039" style="s2">hard and things still didn&#39;t work out</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.880" end="01:09:34.869" style="s2">for them and I think that ambiguity is</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.039" end="01:09:38.380" style="s2">appropriate in the story because that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.869" end="01:09:40.929" style="s2">imbued ambiguity is in life it you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.380" end="01:09:42.789" style="s2">a fool to say that everything always</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.929" end="01:09:44.739" style="s2">works out for everyone if they just do</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.789" end="01:09:47.019" style="s2">things right I mean I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.739" end="01:09:49.239" style="s2">very that&#39;s a very careless thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.019" end="01:09:50.859" style="s2">given how much tragedy and catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.239" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">there is in the world and how much of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.859" end="01:09:55.590" style="s2">seems to be undeserved but that still</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:58.749" style="s2">has very little bearing I think on on</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.590" end="01:10:09.130" style="s2">your own individual adventure and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.749" end="01:10:12.190" style="s2">necessity for the necessity for opening</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.130" end="01:10:14.710" style="s2">the door to who you could be and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.190" end="01:10:17.079" style="s2">necessity to do that seriously and I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.710" end="01:10:19.059" style="s2">believe and I think I think that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.079" end="01:10:21.249" style="s2">this most impossible of verses you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.059" end="01:10:24.999" style="s2">knock and the door will open</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.249" end="01:10:29.550" style="s2">why that&#39;s believable is that I have</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.999" end="01:10:34.050" style="s2">never met anyone who couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.550" end="01:10:36.429" style="s2">hypothesize a better them in some manner</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.050" end="01:10:37.869" style="s2">all they had to do was ask it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.429" end="01:10:40.020" style="s2">well how could you be better I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.869" end="01:10:41.160" style="s2">well here&#39;s three ways it&#39;s like it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.020" end="01:10:43.650" style="s2">problem right you can think about that</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.160" end="01:10:45.840" style="s2">no time cloud maybe it&#39;s small ways but</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.650" end="01:10:48.090" style="s2">you can almost always at least think of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.840" end="01:10:50.460" style="s2">something stupid that you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.090" end="01:10:52.380" style="s2">you could quit and so that means that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.460" end="01:10:53.730" style="s2">you do have this it&#39;s a strange thing in</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.380" end="01:10:56.250" style="s2">people that we have this built-in</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.730" end="01:10:58.830" style="s2">capacity to pause it a higher self and</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.250" end="01:11:00.390" style="s2">then to move towards it and maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.830" end="01:11:02.820" style="s2">that&#39;s part of where the religious</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.390" end="01:11:05.010" style="s2">instinct really came from speaking like</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.820" end="01:11:06.510" style="s2">really reductionistic ly like as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.010" end="01:11:08.790" style="s2">materialist as an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.510" end="01:11:10.740" style="s2">psychologist we we have this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.790" end="01:11:12.390" style="s2">the transcendent ideal right that it</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.740" end="01:11:13.560" style="s2">seems to be pervasive across cultures</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.390" end="01:11:16.470" style="s2">well maybe that&#39;s the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.560" end="01:11:18.390" style="s2">manifestation of the human proclivity to</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.470" end="01:11:20.580" style="s2">be able to pause it an ideal at all and</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.390" end="01:11:23.370" style="s2">to move forward you pause an ideal okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.580" end="01:11:25.290" style="s2">that you need that to move forward well</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.370" end="01:11:25.890" style="s2">if you can pause it an ideal why can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.290" end="01:11:28.140" style="s2">you pause it</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.890" end="01:11:29.580" style="s2">the ultimate ideal well if you can then</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.140" end="01:11:32.250" style="s2">instantly you&#39;ve got a religious</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.580" end="01:11:34.260" style="s2">sensibility instantly and so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.250" end="01:11:36.270" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of puzzles like as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.260" end="01:11:38.850" style="s2">biologist what the hell is the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.270" end="01:11:40.950" style="s2">the religious instinct because the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.850" end="01:11:43.020" style="s2">that it&#39;s mere superstition like we can</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.950" end="01:11:45.420" style="s2">just dispense with that that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.020" end="01:11:47.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a human Universal you can evoke</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.420" end="01:11:49.260" style="s2">religious experiences all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.190" end="01:11:50.970" style="s2">so we&#39;re not going to play that game</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.260" end="01:11:53.670" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some reason that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.970" end="01:11:55.410" style="s2">instinct exists and this the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.670" end="01:11:57.570" style="s2">to do with it is to try to reduce it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.410" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">something that&#39;s biological and leave it</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.570" end="01:12:00.060" style="s2">at that</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:12:01.980" style="s2">not to mess with the metaphysics but it</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.060" end="01:12:03.870" style="s2">certainly could be the case that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.980" end="01:12:06.360" style="s2">the ultimate extension of our capacity</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.870" end="01:12:09.870" style="s2">to posit an ideal and we also might say</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.360" end="01:12:11.400" style="s2">well that&#39;s good enough because well the</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.870" end="01:12:12.720" style="s2">ideal moves you forward it fills your</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.400" end="01:12:14.700" style="s2">life with meaning there&#39;s no doubt about</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.720" end="01:12:16.230" style="s2">that because it is in the movement</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.700" end="01:12:19.290" style="s2">towards your ideal that life&#39;s meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.230" end="01:12:21.000" style="s2">is to be attained and then the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.290" end="01:12:23.070" style="s2">is well how much meaning is there in</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.000" end="01:12:24.810" style="s2">moving forward towards an ultimate ideal</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.070" end="01:12:29.190" style="s2">well more meaning even though it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.810" end="01:12:33.300" style="s2">difficult how much well that&#39;s the open</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.190" end="01:12:34.680" style="s2">question behold I will stand at the door</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.300" end="01:12:36.240" style="s2">and knock and if any man hear my voice</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.680" end="01:12:37.950" style="s2">and open the door I will come in to him</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.240" end="01:12:42.510" style="s2">and will sup with him and he with me</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.950" end="01:12:43.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good deal and the angel</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.510" end="01:12:47.010" style="s2">said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.800" end="01:12:49.260" style="s2">and Abraham said Behold in the tent and</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.010" end="01:12:51.060" style="s2">he said I will certainly return unto</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.260" end="01:12:53.790" style="s2">thee according to the time of life and</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.060" end="01:12:55.920" style="s2">lo Sarah thy wife</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.790" end="01:13:00.240" style="s2">have a son and Sarah herded in the tent</p>

<p begin="01:13:00.240" end="01:13:04.110" style="s2">and Sarah were old and well stricken in</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.890" end="01:13:06.180" style="s2">age and it had ceased to be with Sarah</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.110" end="01:13:08.090" style="s2">after the manner of women therefore</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.180" end="01:13:11.220" style="s2">Sarah laughed within herself saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.090" end="01:13:13.580" style="s2">after I am waxed old shall I also have</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.220" end="01:13:16.620" style="s2">this pleasure my lord being old also</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.580" end="01:13:19.800" style="s2">well she&#39;s kind of skeptical about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.620" end="01:13:23.670" style="s2">whole angel man God having a child at a</p>

<p begin="01:13:23.670" end="01:13:31.950" style="s2">and so rightly so and the Lord said unto</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.400" end="01:13:34.940" style="s2">Abraham why did Sarah laugh saying shall</p>

<p begin="01:13:38.580" end="01:13:41.820" style="s2">time appointed I will return unto thee</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.350" end="01:13:43.980" style="s2">according to the time of life and Sarah</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.820" end="01:13:46.260" style="s2">shall have a son then Sarah denied</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.980" end="01:13:58.490" style="s2">saying I laughed not for she was afraid</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.260" end="01:14:00.960" style="s2">and he said nay but thou didst laugh and</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.490" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">the men rose up from thence and looked</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.960" end="01:14:10.890" style="s2">toward Sodom and Abraham went with them</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:12.510" style="s2">to bring them on the way I&#39;m gonna make</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.890" end="01:14:14.700" style="s2">a small detour and talk to you about</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.510" end="01:14:16.470" style="s2">this idea of potential again because</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.700" end="01:14:18.930" style="s2">it&#39;s really I&#39;ve really thought about it</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.470" end="01:14:20.700" style="s2">a lot I think music speaks of potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.930" end="01:14:22.530" style="s2">like I think music speaks of potential</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.700" end="01:14:23.940" style="s2">bursting forward it&#39;s something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.530" end="01:14:26.730" style="s2">something like that and that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.940" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">so deeply meaningful and and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.730" end="01:14:33.000" style="s2">continual pattern revelation of the next</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2">wonderful thing that might happen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.000" end="01:14:37.530" style="s2">something like that so there&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.760" end="01:14:40.260" style="s2">people find that deeply meaningful and</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.530" end="01:14:42.900" style="s2">then there&#39;s the idea that we all have</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.260" end="01:14:45.240" style="s2">potential that isn&#39;t realized but that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.900" end="01:14:48.300" style="s2">we regard that potential even though</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.240" end="01:14:49.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not realized as real which I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.300" end="01:14:51.510" style="s2">get my head around at all it just</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.530" end="01:14:54.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense and then although</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.510" end="01:14:56.220" style="s2">everyone acts that way and everyone</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.030" end="01:14:57.960" style="s2">believes it because what you act</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.220" end="01:14:59.670" style="s2">reflects what you believe and you make</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.960" end="01:15:01.470" style="s2">judgments about yourself and others</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.670" end="01:15:03.840" style="s2">based on those beliefs and their deep</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.470" end="01:15:05.370" style="s2">judgments so the idea that you believe</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.840" end="01:15:06.990" style="s2">that there is such a thing as human</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.370" end="01:15:07.639" style="s2">potential I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.990" end="01:15:09.919" style="s2">undeniable</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.639" end="01:15:12.019" style="s2">if you act at all if you expect things</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.919" end="01:15:13.789" style="s2">of people at all then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.019" end="01:15:15.619" style="s2">demonstrating your commitment to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.789" end="01:15:16.999" style="s2">idea of potential but then I wonder if</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.619" end="01:15:19.519" style="s2">there&#39;s something even deeper going on</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.999" end="01:15:22.399" style="s2">because we are very materialistic modern</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.519" end="01:15:24.739" style="s2">people and there&#39;s great power in that</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.399" end="01:15:28.039" style="s2">obviously I mean we&#39;ve obtained great</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.739" end="01:15:30.860" style="s2">control over the material world for</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.039" end="01:15:33.260" style="s2">better or for worse but we do have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.860" end="01:15:35.090" style="s2">tendency to think of the world purely as</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.260" end="01:15:36.860" style="s2">a material structure and isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.090" end="01:15:39.800" style="s2">obvious to me that the world is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.860" end="01:15:41.510" style="s2">a material structure it seems to be to</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.800" end="01:15:44.989" style="s2">be something more like constrained</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.510" end="01:15:47.119" style="s2">potential you know because everything is</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.989" end="01:15:49.159" style="s2">a certain way but everything that is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.119" end="01:15:50.479" style="s2">certain way could be a multitude of</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.159" end="01:15:53.090" style="s2">other ways in almost an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.479" end="01:15:54.769" style="s2">multitude of other ways and the degree</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.090" end="01:15:56.929" style="s2">to which something that is could be a</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.769" end="01:15:58.699" style="s2">multitude of other ways is dependent a</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.929" end="01:16:00.679" style="s2">large part on how you interact with it</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.699" end="01:16:01.669" style="s2">right even with materials that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.679" end="01:16:05.360" style="s2">very familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.669" end="01:16:07.909" style="s2">we continue to discover new properties</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.360" end="01:16:10.429" style="s2">and put them to use it&#39;s like things are</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.909" end="01:16:12.860" style="s2">things are compacted into their material</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.429" end="01:16:15.079" style="s2">form but that doesn&#39;t exhaust what they</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.860" end="01:16:17.899" style="s2">are especially not in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.079" end="01:16:19.939" style="s2">other things and so it seems to me even</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.899" end="01:16:22.039" style="s2">if you can&#39;t replace the materialist</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.939" end="01:16:23.919" style="s2">perspective with the perspective that</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.039" end="01:16:26.030" style="s2">it&#39;s better to construe the world</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.919" end="01:16:27.949" style="s2">construe being as if it&#39;s made of</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.030" end="01:16:29.719" style="s2">possibility rather than the world as if</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.949" end="01:16:32.179" style="s2">it&#39;s made of matter it&#39;s at least useful</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.719" end="01:16:34.519" style="s2">to have that as an additional viewpoint</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.179" end="01:16:36.320" style="s2">is that because you could say well the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.519" end="01:16:38.090" style="s2">material philosophy is very useful as a</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.320" end="01:16:39.619" style="s2">tool for obtaining certain sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.090" end="01:16:41.389" style="s2">benefits which it clearly is</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.619" end="01:16:43.159" style="s2">but then this more metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.389" end="01:16:44.689" style="s2">perspective which i think is more</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.159" end="01:16:47.179" style="s2">accurate in some ways that the world is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.689" end="01:16:48.979" style="s2">a place of potential is also an</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.179" end="01:16:52.309" style="s2">extraordinarily useful way to approach</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.979" end="01:16:54.679" style="s2">the world and and it&#39;s practically</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.309" end="01:16:56.719" style="s2">useful you know what we talked last week</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.679" end="01:16:59.510" style="s2">a little bit about doing something as</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.719" end="01:17:01.340" style="s2">simple as trying to organize a room it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.510" end="01:17:04.070" style="s2">it&#39;s by no means obvious how much</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.340" end="01:17:06.409" style="s2">potential there is in a room right</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.070" end="01:17:08.479" style="s2">there&#39;s a very large amount of potential</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.409" end="01:17:09.739" style="s2">in any given room tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.479" end="01:17:11.599" style="s2">potential especially if it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.739" end="01:17:14.090" style="s2">with people I think maybe an</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.599" end="01:17:15.679" style="s2">inexhaustible amount of potential and</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.090" end="01:17:17.360" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s an inexhaustible amount of</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.679" end="01:17:19.880" style="s2">potential everywhere and we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.360" end="01:17:21.269" style="s2">know how to get access to it well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.880" end="01:17:23.129" style="s2">certainly true</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.269" end="01:17:24.569" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly true to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.129" end="01:17:25.889" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to get access to all</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.569" end="01:17:27.749" style="s2">the potential of our children for</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.889" end="01:17:32.329" style="s2">example or ourselves or our loved ones</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.749" end="01:17:36.059" style="s2">or it or or the people that we know so</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.329" end="01:17:39.349" style="s2">well so I think the this story is trying</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.059" end="01:17:42.479" style="s2">to hammer that idea home to which is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.349" end="01:17:45.629" style="s2">don&#39;t be so sure that it&#39;s impossible or</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.479" end="01:17:48.659" style="s2">maybe don&#39;t let the assumption that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.629" end="01:17:50.549" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible stop you from going</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.659" end="01:17:52.229" style="s2">forth into the world that would be and</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.549" end="01:17:53.999" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a what would you say</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.229" end="01:17:56.939" style="s2">that&#39;s like an inoculation against</p>

<p begin="01:18:05.419" end="01:18:10.169" style="s2">associated with the observation of</p>

<p begin="01:18:15.749" end="01:18:21.029" style="s2">whatsoever and I think the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.729" end="01:18:24.209" style="s2">that is that it forced all the effort it</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.029" end="01:18:27.389" style="s2">four stalls the ability to discover for</p>

<p begin="01:19:24.569" end="01:19:29.059" style="s2">to that possibility right because you</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.450" end="01:19:45.660" style="s2">errors you might be committing another</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.460" end="01:19:47.520" style="s2">thing that&#39;s really interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.660" end="01:19:50.250" style="s2">the Jews in the Old Testament it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.520" end="01:19:52.260" style="s2">remarkable thing every single time they</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.250" end="01:19:58.200" style="s2">get flattened by God it&#39;s always their</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.260" end="01:20:00.060" style="s2">fault they never say the world that God</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.200" end="01:20:01.620" style="s2">created was corrupt and God is evil they</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.060" end="01:20:03.900" style="s2">never say that no matter what happens</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.620" end="01:20:06.480" style="s2">right no matter what catastrophe occurs</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.900" end="01:20:09.270" style="s2">when they have every reason to at least</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.480" end="01:20:14.220" style="s2">put that hypothesis forward they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.270" end="01:20:15.540" style="s2">they say we erred we walked off the path</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.220" end="01:20:18.750" style="s2">it&#39;s our fault</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.540" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s hard you know because it puts</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.750" end="01:20:23.070" style="s2">all the weight of human capacity on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:27.540" style="s2">human being that&#39;s very hard but the</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.070" end="01:20:29.520" style="s2">outside is it gives you the control it</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.540" end="01:20:31.080" style="s2">opens up the door that it opens up the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.520" end="01:20:32.970" style="s2">possibility that you could be the person</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.080" end="01:20:35.300" style="s2">that could set it right if you would</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.970" end="01:20:44.670" style="s2">just let go of what&#39;s in your way</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.300" end="01:20:46.260" style="s2">whatever that is and the men rose up</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.670" end="01:20:47.700" style="s2">from thence and look towards Saul to man</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.260" end="01:20:52.590" style="s2">Abraham went with them to bring them on</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.700" end="01:20:55.140" style="s2">the way and the Lord said shall I hide</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.590" end="01:20:55.680" style="s2">from Abraham that thing which I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.140" end="01:20:57.900" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.680" end="01:20:59.280" style="s2">seeing that Abraham shall surely become</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.900" end="01:21:01.530" style="s2">a great mighty nation and all the</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.280" end="01:21:05.070" style="s2">nations of the earth shall be blessed in</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.530" end="01:21:07.880" style="s2">him I guess God is talking to himself</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.070" end="01:21:09.930" style="s2">here or maybe he&#39;s talking to the angels</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.880" end="01:21:13.680" style="s2">but I think he&#39;s trying to make a</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.930" end="01:21:15.210" style="s2">decision for I know him that he will</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.680" end="01:21:17.970" style="s2">command his children and his household</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.210" end="01:21:19.890" style="s2">after him and they shall keep the way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.970" end="01:21:22.140" style="s2">the Lord to do justice and judgment that</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.890" end="01:21:25.320" style="s2">the Lord may bring upon Abraham that</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.140" end="01:21:29.370" style="s2">which he has spoken of them and the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.320" end="01:21:31.590" style="s2">said because the cry of Sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.370" end="01:21:34.910" style="s2">Gomorrah is great and because their sin</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.590" end="01:21:36.600" style="s2">is very Grievous I will go down now and</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.910" end="01:21:39.390" style="s2">see whether they have done altogether</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.600" end="01:21:44.520" style="s2">according to the cry of it which has</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.390" end="01:21:46.050" style="s2">come to me and if not I will know well</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.520" end="01:21:47.460" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened in Sodom</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.050" end="01:21:48.810" style="s2">and Gomorrah but we know that God&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.460" end="01:21:51.930" style="s2">wind of it and that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.810" end="01:21:54.450" style="s2">good and we know that sin means to miss</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.930" end="01:21:56.220" style="s2">the mark and so we know that whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.450" end="01:21:59.310" style="s2">has happened in Sodom and Gomorrah means</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.220" end="01:22:01.200" style="s2">that something about the natural ethical</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.310" end="01:22:04.890" style="s2">order of things has been seriously</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.200" end="01:22:06.240" style="s2">violated and there&#39;s a strong intimation</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.890" end="01:22:09.510" style="s2">in the Old Testament which I think by</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.240" end="01:22:12.810" style="s2">the way is completely correct that if</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.510" end="01:22:13.980" style="s2">the proper order of being is violated</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.810" end="01:22:15.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s something like the balance</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.980" end="01:22:20.220" style="s2">between chaos and order say if the</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.900" end="01:22:23.310" style="s2">proper balance of being is violated then</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.220" end="01:22:25.050" style="s2">all hell will break loose and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.310" end="01:22:29.370" style="s2">things I can tell you from reading a</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.050" end="01:22:31.800" style="s2">very from reading a very comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.370" end="01:22:33.840" style="s2">set of myths from around the world is</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.800" end="01:22:37.860" style="s2">that that&#39;s a conclusion that human</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.840" end="01:22:40.290" style="s2">beings have come to everywhere stay on</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.860" end="01:22:42.960" style="s2">the goddamn path and be careful because</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.290" end="01:22:45.630" style="s2">if you start to mess around and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.960" end="01:22:48.510" style="s2">deviate especially if you know that</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.630" end="01:22:50.760" style="s2">you&#39;re deviating things are not going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.510" end="01:22:52.800" style="s2">go well for you and that idea is</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.760" end="01:22:54.270" style="s2">everywhere and I think it&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.800" end="01:22:55.620" style="s2">think the idea is right because there</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.270" end="01:22:57.060" style="s2">aren&#39;t that many ways of doing things</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.620" end="01:22:59.310" style="s2">right and there&#39;s a lot of ways of doing</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.060" end="01:23:01.500" style="s2">things wrong and if you do things wrong</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.310" end="01:23:03.690" style="s2">the consequences of doing them wrong can</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.500" end="01:23:06.390" style="s2">be truly catastrophic you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.690" end="01:23:08.730" style="s2">the things I learned from reading Viktor</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.390" end="01:23:10.770" style="s2">Frankl first but then Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.730" end="01:23:13.680" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn who I think did a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.770" end="01:23:17.550" style="s2">job was that and vaclav havel thought</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.680" end="01:23:18.960" style="s2">the same thing that these people were</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.550" end="01:23:21.180" style="s2">very much trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.960" end="01:23:22.020" style="s2">happened in places like Nazi Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.180" end="01:23:23.820" style="s2">in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.020" end="01:23:26.400" style="s2">so schnitzel school like our Capello&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.820" end="01:23:27.930" style="s2">caligo is a particularly good analysis</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.400" end="01:23:31.560" style="s2">of what happened in the Soviet Union and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.930" end="01:23:33.480" style="s2">his conclusion and it&#39;s a 20 100 page</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.560" end="01:23:35.310" style="s2">conclusion and it&#39;s like hammered home</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.480" end="01:23:37.350" style="s2">with a hammer it&#39;s it&#39;s a book that</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.310" end="01:23:39.510" style="s2">everyone should read you know assuming</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.350" end="01:23:41.820" style="s2">that you can read a 20 100 page screen</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.510" end="01:23:43.650" style="s2">because that&#39;s basically what it is you</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.820" end="01:23:45.420" style="s2">know first of all what he does is</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.650" end="01:23:47.520" style="s2">document just how terrible things were</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.420" end="01:23:49.800" style="s2">in the Soviet Union between 1919 and</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.520" end="01:23:51.690" style="s2">1959 and no matter how terrible you</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.800" end="01:23:53.640" style="s2">think they were unless you know the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.690" end="01:23:55.460" style="s2">stories they were a lot more terrible</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.640" end="01:23:58.170" style="s2">than that and they were terrible</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.460" end="01:24:01.950" style="s2">personally because everyone lied they</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.170" end="01:24:02.760" style="s2">were terrible in families because two</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.950" end="01:24:04.470" style="s2">out of five</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.760" end="01:24:06.660" style="s2">were government and farmers they were</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.470" end="01:24:08.070" style="s2">terrible among friends because no one</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.660" end="01:24:09.750" style="s2">could tell each other the truth they</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.070" end="01:24:11.550" style="s2">were terrible socially because the whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.750" end="01:24:14.580" style="s2">system was corrupted ban on slave labor</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.550" end="01:24:16.830" style="s2">and they were terrible philosophically</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.580" end="01:24:18.900" style="s2">because the doctrine of man upon which</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.830" end="01:24:22.340" style="s2">the state was founded was hopeless and</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.900" end="01:24:26.580" style="s2">nihilistic and and they were murderous</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.340" end="01:24:28.470" style="s2">destructive and genocidal it&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.580" end="01:24:32.040" style="s2">got it wrong at every single level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.470" end="01:24:35.430" style="s2">analysis simultaneously and the question</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.040" end="01:24:37.140" style="s2">is why and Solzhenitsyn&#39;s answer and to</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.430" end="01:24:39.120" style="s2">some degree Victor Frankel&#39;s answer as</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.140" end="01:24:41.700" style="s2">well and vaclav havel and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.120" end="01:24:44.820" style="s2">also Nelson Mandela and Gandhi they all</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.700" end="01:24:47.130" style="s2">they all ended up in the same conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.820" end="01:24:49.620" style="s2">sphere and the answer was because</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.130" end="01:24:52.380" style="s2">individual people lived crooked lives</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.620" end="01:24:55.110" style="s2">because individual people swallowed lies</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.380" end="01:24:57.810" style="s2">and spoke them and didn&#39;t stand up for</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.110" end="01:24:59.970" style="s2">the truth and the corruption that spread</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.810" end="01:25:02.490" style="s2">from each individual pulled the entire</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.970" end="01:25:05.310" style="s2">state mechanism into that corruption and</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.490" end="01:25:07.440" style="s2">made everything into hell you know there</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.310" end="01:25:09.030" style="s2">are other theories obedience right</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.440" end="01:25:11.790" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the Milgram idea from</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.030" end="01:25:13.920" style="s2">that it&#39;s easy to make human beings OBD</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.790" end="01:25:15.660" style="s2">obedient to people in authority and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.920" end="01:25:17.490" style="s2">explored that idea quite a bit with</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.660" end="01:25:19.430" style="s2">regards to what happens happen for</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.490" end="01:25:22.770" style="s2">example in the Nazi concentration camps</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.430" end="01:25:25.860" style="s2">yes you can set circumstances up so that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.770" end="01:25:28.020" style="s2">people are likely to be obedient to</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.860" end="01:25:30.060" style="s2">orders that are pathological there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.020" end="01:25:31.560" style="s2">doubt about that and yes sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.060" end="01:25:33.270" style="s2">that&#39;s indicative of the weakness of</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.560" end="01:25:36.090" style="s2">their character but that&#39;s not the issue</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.270" end="01:25:39.330" style="s2">and the idea that what happened in Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.090" end="01:25:41.580" style="s2">Germany was because a population of good</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.330" end="01:25:43.680" style="s2">people listen to a tiny minority of bad</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.580" end="01:25:48.870" style="s2">people that&#39;s a really that&#39;s really not</p>

<p begin="01:25:48.870" end="01:25:53.430" style="s2">there at every single level of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.120" end="01:25:56.970" style="s2">social organization right right from the</p>

<p begin="01:26:03.570" end="01:26:13.719" style="s2">thing in the Soviet Union and so well so</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.390" end="01:26:15.130" style="s2">if you miss the</p>

<p begin="01:26:15.130" end="01:26:21.630" style="s2">sodom and gomorrha did their sin was</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.400" end="01:26:25.510" style="s2">Grievous than they risk destruction and</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.630" end="01:26:27.820" style="s2">I just cannot see how after the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.510" end="01:26:32.199" style="s2">century anyone with any sense could</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.820" end="01:26:33.699" style="s2">possibly not see that as true and I</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.199" end="01:26:35.770" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a line in the Old</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.699" end="01:26:38.890" style="s2">Testament you know that the fear of God</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.770" end="01:26:39.940" style="s2">is the beginning of wisdom and I can</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.890" end="01:26:43.600" style="s2">tell you one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.940" end="01:26:45.100" style="s2">frightened me badly was the realization</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.600" end="01:26:46.270" style="s2">from reading Souls nets and and a</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.100" end="01:26:48.060" style="s2">variety of other things that I was</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.270" end="01:26:49.989" style="s2">reading at the same time that</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.060" end="01:26:53.860" style="s2">Dostoyevsky as well because he makes the</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.989" end="01:26:55.570" style="s2">same point he said that a human being is</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.860" end="01:26:56.890" style="s2">not only responsible for everything they</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.570" end="01:26:59.590" style="s2">do but for everything that everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.890" end="01:27:01.239" style="s2">does now you know that&#39;s crazy and he</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.590" end="01:27:02.260" style="s2">was an epileptic and a mystic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.239" end="01:27:04.120" style="s2">a crazy thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.260" end="01:27:06.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s also there&#39;s something about it</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.120" end="01:27:07.930" style="s2">that&#39;s true because if you were better</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.040" end="01:27:10.239" style="s2">the people around you would be less</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.930" end="01:27:11.560" style="s2">worse than they are and if you were good</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.239" end="01:27:14.320" style="s2">enough you don&#39;t know how much better</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.560" end="01:27:17.260" style="s2">the people around you would be and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.320" end="01:27:19.870" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea too you know that</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.260" end="01:27:22.449" style="s2">Christ took the sins of the world unto</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.870" end="01:27:24.190" style="s2">himself that&#39;s a complicated idea that I</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.449" end="01:27:25.930" style="s2">wrestled with that one for a very long</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.190" end="01:27:27.100" style="s2">time but I think I figured out at least</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.930" end="01:27:31.930" style="s2">in part what it means</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.100" end="01:27:35.050" style="s2">it meant that it&#39;s something like the</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.930" end="01:27:37.060" style="s2">realization of complete humanity you see</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.050" end="01:27:41.320" style="s2">to take the sins of the world unto</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.060" end="01:27:43.900" style="s2">yourself is to realize that is to</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.320" end="01:27:47.140" style="s2">understand the Nazi concentration camp</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.900" end="01:27:51.520" style="s2">guard because that person is human and</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.140" end="01:27:54.160" style="s2">so are you and so if you can&#39;t see you</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.520" end="01:27:58.030" style="s2">in that then you don&#39;t know who you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.160" end="01:27:59.320" style="s2">and if you can see you in that well then</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.030" end="01:28:01.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve started to take the sins of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.320" end="01:28:02.860" style="s2">world onto yourself because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.000" end="01:28:04.660" style="s2">actually started to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.860" end="01:28:08.170" style="s2">for those terrible things you know I</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.660" end="01:28:12.910" style="s2">think it&#39;s the motif of the the motto of</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.170" end="01:28:15.940" style="s2">the Holocaust Museum in Washington we</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.910" end="01:28:18.550" style="s2">must never forget that&#39;s close and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.940" end="01:28:20.080" style="s2">think well you can&#39;t forgive you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.550" end="01:28:21.760" style="s2">remember what you don&#39;t understand you</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.080" end="01:28:23.380" style="s2">will forget what you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.760" end="01:28:27.090" style="s2">and the question is what are you</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.380" end="01:28:27.090" style="s2">supposed to remember about the Holocaust</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.489" end="01:28:32.679" style="s2">historical event that six million people</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.249" end="01:28:35.050" style="s2">died that&#39;s not what&#39;s to remember</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.679" end="01:28:37.960" style="s2">what&#39;s to remember is that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.050" end="01:28:41.170" style="s2">can do and you&#39;re one of them</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.960" end="01:28:43.269" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t understand that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.170" end="01:28:45.420" style="s2">could do that then you don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.269" end="01:28:45.420" style="s2">you are</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.000" end="01:28:59.290" style="s2">so God&#39;s making a case here he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.800" end="01:29:01.690" style="s2">a case that the people of the Sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.290" end="01:29:03.700" style="s2">Gomorrha have sinned and it&#39;s making a</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.690" end="01:29:06.010" style="s2">large racket that even God has heard</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.700" end="01:29:09.160" style="s2">about that&#39;s a very common mythological</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.010" end="01:29:13.690" style="s2">motif by the way that the sins and and</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.160" end="01:29:16.330" style="s2">and and what would you call it the sins</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.690" end="01:29:18.550" style="s2">and noise of humanity can read such a</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.330" end="01:29:20.350" style="s2">clamor that even the gods hearin and are</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.550" end="01:29:22.380" style="s2">forced to intervene that comes all the</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.350" end="01:29:25.390" style="s2">way from the Mesopotamian creation story</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.380" end="01:29:27.970" style="s2">so anyways it&#39;s logical yeah their</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.390" end="01:29:30.340" style="s2">sinning okay well so what well no not so</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.970" end="01:29:32.680" style="s2">what it means that God&#39;s offended and</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.340" end="01:29:34.480" style="s2">that everything is at risk that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.680" end="01:29:38.410" style="s2">it means it&#39;s like that&#39;s a something</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.480" end="01:29:39.760" style="s2">worth taking seriously and the men</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.410" end="01:29:42.070" style="s2">turned their faces from thence and went</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.760" end="01:29:44.110" style="s2">towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.070" end="01:29:46.600" style="s2">before the Lord and Abraham drew near</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.110" end="01:29:49.510" style="s2">and said will thou also destroy the</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.600" end="01:29:53.170" style="s2">righteous with the wicked this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.510" end="01:29:54.610" style="s2">interesting part of the story um friend</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.170" end="01:29:57.490" style="s2">of mine took me to task the other day</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.610" end="01:29:59.290" style="s2">when I was writing about portraying the</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.490" end="01:30:01.090" style="s2">Old Testament God is pretty harsh and</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.290" end="01:30:03.100" style="s2">judgmental and the New Testament God is</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.090" end="01:30:04.090" style="s2">sort of all loving which he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.100" end="01:30:07.750" style="s2">because there&#39;s the whole Book of</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.090" end="01:30:09.540" style="s2">Revelations thing but um but I got that</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.750" end="01:30:11.590" style="s2">partly from reading Northrop Frye but</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.540" end="01:30:13.680" style="s2">going through the Old Testament more</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.590" end="01:30:16.960" style="s2">detail I realized that that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.680" end="01:30:19.690" style="s2">too low resolution interpretation and</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.960" end="01:30:22.180" style="s2">that God who&#39;s dispensing a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.690" end="01:30:23.950" style="s2">harsh justice in the Old Testament it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.180" end="01:30:26.170" style="s2">also someone who can be negotiated with</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.950" end="01:30:26.590" style="s2">weirdly enough and that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.170" end="01:30:28.960" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.590" end="01:30:30.670" style="s2">you know Abraham has just been told that</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.960" end="01:30:32.410" style="s2">whatever&#39;s going on in Sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.670" end="01:30:33.850" style="s2">Gomorrah is seriously not good and that</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.410" end="01:30:36.040" style="s2">God&#39;s going to do something about it and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.850" end="01:30:39.550" style="s2">he takes it upon himself this is an act</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.040" end="01:30:41.470" style="s2">of mercy to to ask God to be a bit more</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.550" end="01:30:43.120" style="s2">judicious right it&#39;s like okay you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.470" end="01:30:44.500" style="s2">gonna wipe out the city well bad things</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.120" end="01:30:46.330" style="s2">are happening there but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.500" end="01:30:48.670" style="s2">probably a few people in the damn city</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.330" end="01:30:49.810" style="s2">that aren&#39;t completely corrupted by</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.670" end="01:30:51.940" style="s2">what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.810" end="01:30:53.230" style="s2">of course that&#39;s an open question you</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.940" end="01:30:54.910" style="s2">know because it&#39;s an open question for</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.230" end="01:30:56.470" style="s2">example how many people were there were</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.910" end="01:30:58.210" style="s2">in Nazi Germany who weren&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.470" end="01:30:59.950" style="s2">corrupted by what was going on in Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.210" end="01:31:01.960" style="s2">Germany and the same thing could be said</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.950" end="01:31:03.580" style="s2">about Mallis China and the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.960" end="01:31:05.920" style="s2">could be said about the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.580" end="01:31:07.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like well perhaps there was a</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.920" end="01:31:09.310" style="s2">person somewhere who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.540" end="01:31:12.160" style="s2">and at some level what was happening but</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.310" end="01:31:13.840" style="s2">you know the whole issue of willful</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.160" end="01:31:14.500" style="s2">blindness certainly springs to mind if</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.840" end="01:31:16.900" style="s2">nothing else</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.500" end="01:31:20.800" style="s2">anyways Abraham decides to intercede</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.900" end="01:31:23.170" style="s2">with God on behalf of these people who</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.800" end="01:31:24.970" style="s2">are going to be destroyed he says will</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.170" end="01:31:28.450" style="s2">thou also destroy the righteous with the</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.970" end="01:31:30.190" style="s2">wicked perhaps there be 50 righteous</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.450" end="01:31:32.110" style="s2">people within the city will you also</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.190" end="01:31:35.350" style="s2">destroy and not spare the place for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.110" end="01:31:37.120" style="s2">fifty righteous that are there that be</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.350" end="01:31:38.650" style="s2">far from thee to do after this manner</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.120" end="01:31:40.810" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of reminding God that he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.650" end="01:31:42.850" style="s2">good guy as far as I can tell to slay</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.810" end="01:31:44.020" style="s2">the righteous with the wicked and that</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.850" end="01:31:45.880" style="s2">the righteous should be as the wicked</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.020" end="01:31:48.970" style="s2">thought before from thee should not the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.880" end="01:31:51.040" style="s2">judge of the earth do right and the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.970" end="01:31:53.470" style="s2">said if I find in Sodom fifty right he</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.040" end="01:31:55.330" style="s2">seems a bit taken aback here to me if I</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.470" end="01:31:57.040" style="s2">find him Sodom 50 righteous within the</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.330" end="01:31:59.080" style="s2">city then I will spare the place for</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.040" end="01:32:01.120" style="s2">their sakes and Abraham answered and</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.080" end="01:32:03.100" style="s2">said behold now I have taken upon me to</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.120" end="01:32:07.330" style="s2">speak upon the Lord unto the Lord which</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.100" end="01:32:10.000" style="s2">but I am but dust in ashes possibly</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.330" end="01:32:12.400" style="s2">there shall lack five of the fifty</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.000" end="01:32:15.790" style="s2">righteous will thou destroy all the city</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.400" end="01:32:18.370" style="s2">for lack of five and he said he said God</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.790" end="01:32:20.680" style="s2">said if I find there forty five I will</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.370" end="01:32:22.810" style="s2">not destroy it and Abraham spoke unto</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.680" end="01:32:25.750" style="s2">him yet again and said he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.810" end="01:32:27.340" style="s2">sneaking up on God here huh her</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.750" end="01:32:29.230" style="s2">adventure there shall be forty found</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.340" end="01:32:33.180" style="s2">there and he said I will not do it for</p>

<p begin="01:32:36.510" end="01:32:41.710" style="s2">possibly there shall be thirty found</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.550" end="01:32:44.830" style="s2">there and God said I won&#39;t do it if I</p>

<p begin="01:32:44.830" end="01:32:49.540" style="s2">really to be pushing his luck by this</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.480" end="01:32:51.340" style="s2">point says behold I have taken upon me</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.540" end="01:32:53.440" style="s2">to speak under the Lord possibly there</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.340" end="01:32:57.640" style="s2">shall be twenty found there and God said</p>

<p begin="01:32:57.640" end="01:33:04.660" style="s2">said oh let the Lord not be angry and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.750" end="01:33:06.700" style="s2">will speak yet but this once perhaps ten</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.660" end="01:33:09.760" style="s2">shall be found there and he said I will</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.700" end="01:33:11.350" style="s2">not destroy it for 10s sake and the Lord</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.760" end="01:33:12.910" style="s2">went his way and as soon as he had left</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.350" end="01:33:15.310" style="s2">communing with Abraham and Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.910" end="01:33:16.870" style="s2">returned unto his place well there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.310" end="01:33:20.680" style="s2">ways you can read that part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.870" end="01:33:21.519" style="s2">one is that three let&#39;s say you can</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.680" end="01:33:23.349" style="s2">bargain with God</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.519" end="01:33:24.760" style="s2">even if you&#39;re kind of annoying about it</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.349" end="01:33:29.499" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.760" end="01:33:31.690" style="s2">the second is that even if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.499" end="01:33:33.659" style="s2">minority of good in a place that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.690" end="01:33:36.519" style="s2">good it won&#39;t be slated for destruction</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.659" end="01:33:40.059" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a good thing and the</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.519" end="01:33:42.880" style="s2">third is a minority of good in a place</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.059" end="01:33:44.559" style="s2">can keep it from being destroyed and</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.880" end="01:33:48.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good thing too and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.559" end="01:33:51.309" style="s2">believe that as well I think that good</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.190" end="01:33:53.440" style="s2">is more powerful than evil naivety isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.309" end="01:33:56.789" style="s2">but I think that good is and I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.440" end="01:33:58.960" style="s2">that in a place that&#39;s corrupt a</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.789" end="01:34:04.079" style="s2">minority of people who stand forth</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.960" end="01:34:04.079" style="s2">against the corruption can prevail now</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.079" end="01:34:11.980" style="s2">you know I think I think one of the best</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.519" end="01:34:14.019" style="s2">examples of that again was all Alexander</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.980" end="01:34:16.059" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn because he was in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.019" end="01:34:18.159" style="s2">terrible work camps when he wrote his</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.059" end="01:34:20.050" style="s2">book he memorized most of it which is</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.159" end="01:34:22.690" style="s2">not an easy thing to do when it&#39;s 2,100</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.050" end="01:34:25.599" style="s2">pages long and set in very tiny font he</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.690" end="01:34:28.869" style="s2">memorized most of it and then he wrote</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.599" end="01:34:30.489" style="s2">it and it was one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.869" end="01:34:32.219" style="s2">brought down the Soviet Union you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.489" end="01:34:35.199" style="s2">was published in the 1970s</p>

<p begin="01:34:35.199" end="01:34:43.690" style="s2">first thing that happened at least</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.869" end="01:34:45.400" style="s2">initially was that the communism as an</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.690" end="01:34:47.349" style="s2">ethical system lost absolutely all</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.400" end="01:34:49.690" style="s2">credibility whatsoever among anyone who</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.349" end="01:34:50.949" style="s2">was even vaguely educated immediately</p>

<p begin="01:34:50.949" end="01:34:55.630" style="s2">Archipelago he pulled the moral slats</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.619" end="01:34:57.519" style="s2">out from underneath it and the book was</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.630" end="01:34:58.869" style="s2">definitely one of the reasons there were</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.519" end="01:35:01.809" style="s2">many but was definitely one of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.869" end="01:35:04.630" style="s2">reasons why the rotten system crumbled</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.809" end="01:35:07.659" style="s2">and fell without a war and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.630" end="01:35:11.980" style="s2">great example of how one person can take</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.659" end="01:35:13.630" style="s2">on a tyranny and prevail so and he&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="01:35:13.630" end="01:35:16.659" style="s2">thing because well Gandhi did the same</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.039" end="01:35:19.719" style="s2">thing I mean I don&#39;t think the English</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.659" end="01:35:22.449" style="s2">were the Russians but you know things</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.719" end="01:35:24.219" style="s2">were not so good in India and what</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.449" end="01:35:30.460" style="s2">Gandhi did in India under the influence</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.219" end="01:35:32.170" style="s2">by the way of Leo Tolstoy was also a</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.460" end="01:35:34.600" style="s2">remarkable example of a single person</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.170" end="01:35:36.640" style="s2">intervening in a catastrophe and and</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.600" end="01:35:43.090" style="s2">and and setting it far more right than</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.640" end="01:35:45.610" style="s2">it could be so and there came two angels</p>

<p begin="01:35:45.610" end="01:35:50.020" style="s2">remember Lauda&#39;s Abraham&#39;s nephew sat in</p>

<p begin="01:35:50.020" end="01:35:53.200" style="s2">rose up to meet them and he bowed</p>

<p begin="01:35:53.200" end="01:35:58.360" style="s2">and he said Behold my Lords I turn in I</p>

<p begin="01:36:15.190" end="01:36:19.360" style="s2">insisted he pressed upon them greatly</p>

<p begin="01:37:30.880" end="01:37:36.250" style="s2">something more like the absolute danger</p>

<p begin="01:46:47.300" end="01:46:52.579" style="s2">which is it&#39;s absolutely reprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.420" end="01:46:55.159" style="s2">to justify you&#39;re in action with a</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.579" end="01:46:57.349" style="s2">catastrophe that extracts mercy from</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.159" end="01:46:59.539" style="s2">other people right there&#39;s a tricky</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.349" end="01:47:01.130" style="s2">tricky game that&#39;s going well of course</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.539" end="01:47:02.510" style="s2">I can&#39;t do that look at the terrible</p>

<p begin="01:47:10.099" end="01:47:14.989" style="s2">actually you&#39;re not and it&#39;s rather rude</p>

<p begin="01:47:14.989" end="01:47:20.360" style="s2">certainly counterproductive and Abraham</p>

<p begin="01:47:25.280" end="01:47:34.159" style="s2">and lo the smoke of the country went up</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.730" end="01:47:35.719" style="s2">as a smoke of a furnace and it came to</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.159" end="01:47:37.730" style="s2">pass when God destroyed the cities of</p>

<p begin="01:48:35.000" end="01:48:44.540" style="s2">of log with child by their father well</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.330" end="01:48:46.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like the story you know the story</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.540" end="01:48:49.820" style="s2">is outlined the catastrophe of sodom and</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.940" end="01:48:52.400" style="s2">gomorrah essentially the ethical</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.820" end="01:48:54.680" style="s2">catastrophe of sodom and gomorrah the</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.400" end="01:48:57.130" style="s2">dissolution of the civilized constraints</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.680" end="01:48:59.270" style="s2">that should regulate all behavior and</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.130" end="01:49:00.950" style="s2">then the city is destroyed but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.270" end="01:49:04.090" style="s2">an echo of it afterwards right because</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.950" end="01:49:07.910" style="s2">laud had lived in sodom and gomorrah and</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.090" end="01:49:10.160" style="s2">what happens to him even after his</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.910" end="01:49:14.030" style="s2">escapes is that he gets tangled into an</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.160" end="01:49:17.030" style="s2">incestuous web and so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.030" end="01:49:18.710" style="s2">that&#39;s a it&#39;s not foreshadow its post</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.030" end="01:49:22.730" style="s2">shadowing if there&#39;s such a thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.710" end="01:49:26.480" style="s2">an echo of what it&#39;s an echo and a</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.730" end="01:49:28.280" style="s2">reminder of how terrible whatever it was</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.480" end="01:49:31.490" style="s2">that was happening in Sodom and Gomorrah</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.280" end="01:49:42.140" style="s2">was that even after escaping the</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.490" end="01:49:45.140" style="s2">iniquity still remained well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.140" end="01:49:47.720" style="s2">pretty good place to stop we got through</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.140" end="01:49:48.560" style="s2">two of three stories so that&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.720" end="01:49:50.960" style="s2">bad next week</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.560" end="01:49:53.330" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk about the sacrifice of Isaac</p>

<p begin="01:49:53.330" end="01:49:58.580" style="s2">stories as well and next week is the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.800" end="01:50:01.220" style="s2">last lecture except I talked to the</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.580" end="01:50:03.170" style="s2">theater people and it looks like I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.220" end="01:50:05.840" style="s2">able to rent the theater once a month at</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.170" end="01:50:07.490" style="s2">least for the next four months so I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:50:29.800" end="01:50:38.829" style="s2">I could tell you something cool that</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.880" end="01:50:42.489" style="s2">happened to if you want so some of you</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.829" end="01:50:46.949" style="s2">may know that there was a memo leaked at</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.489" end="01:50:53.889" style="s2">Google how many of you know about that</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.949" end="01:50:56.820" style="s2">Wow law to you so a colleague of the man</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.889" end="01:50:59.469" style="s2">who released the memo got ahold of me</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.820" end="01:51:03.969" style="s2">yesterday and said that the man who</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.469" end="01:51:06.579" style="s2">wrote the memo wanted to talk to me so I</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.969" end="01:51:08.820" style="s2">interviewed him today I made a YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.579" end="01:51:11.500" style="s2">video out of it we went over his memo</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.820" end="01:51:13.780" style="s2">which was scientifically accurate in my</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.500" end="01:51:16.329" style="s2">estimation and so I&#39;m going to release</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.780" end="01:51:18.540" style="s2">that hopefully tonight so we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.329" end="01:51:18.540" style="s2">that goes</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.400" end="01:51:30.020" style="s2">he got fired last night eh right he got</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.920" end="01:51:33.260" style="s2">fired for perpetuating gender</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.020" end="01:51:35.810" style="s2">stereotypes he told me today that his</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.260" end="01:51:39.380" style="s2">last performance review he had been</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.810" end="01:51:42.290" style="s2">given superb which is the top few</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.380" end="01:51:45.800" style="s2">percentiles of the employee distribution</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.290" end="01:51:48.620" style="s2">at Google right perpetuating gender</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.800" end="01:51:50.780" style="s2">stereotypes I went through his document</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.620" end="01:51:53.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t think he said a single thing</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.780" end="01:51:55.610" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t substantiated by a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.360" end="01:51:56.960" style="s2">dense scientific literature not to say</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.610" end="01:51:58.550" style="s2">that the scientific literature is</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.960" end="01:52:01.550" style="s2">necessarily a hundred percent correct</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.550" end="01:52:04.600" style="s2">because it never is but certainly to say</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.550" end="01:52:07.880" style="s2">that he was not merely spouting out</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.600" end="01:52:10.820" style="s2">misogynistic and ethnically biased</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.880" end="01:52:12.560" style="s2">opinion quite the contrary so we had a</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.820" end="01:52:14.240" style="s2">nice discussion about that today and</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.560" end="01:52:23.780" style="s2">hopefully the discussion will continue</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.240" end="01:52:24.440" style="s2">so all right questions hello well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.780" end="01:52:26.030" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.440" end="01:52:28.760" style="s2">I mean look a couple of things about</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.030" end="01:52:32.240" style="s2">that I mean my my daughter has had a</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.760" end="01:52:34.220" style="s2">catastrophic life in many ways a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.240" end="01:52:36.680" style="s2">things went wrong with her physically</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.220" end="01:52:37.400" style="s2">really bad things and this went</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.680" end="01:52:41.140" style="s2">perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.400" end="01:52:41.140" style="s2">so like thank God for that</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.689" end="01:52:48.969" style="s2">so then and then the other thing is I</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.329" end="01:52:53.709" style="s2">love kids you know now infants well you</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.969" end="01:52:57.070" style="s2">know it&#39;s not that I it&#39;s not infants</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.709" end="01:52:58.689" style="s2">are cool and interesting but I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.070" end="01:53:01.179" style="s2">sure exactly what to do with them you</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.689" end="01:53:04.719" style="s2">know but once they&#39;re about six months</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.179" end="01:53:06.760" style="s2">old and then from then on like I love</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.719" end="01:53:08.229" style="s2">having kids around so I&#39;m thrilled about</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.760" end="01:53:08.919" style="s2">the fact that this has happened so</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.229" end="01:53:12.610" style="s2">hooray</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.919" end="01:53:15.400" style="s2">you know hooray so thanks for that</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.610" end="01:53:18.159" style="s2">so more as an aside but what you said</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.400" end="01:53:20.050" style="s2">about not pushing aside the things the</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.159" end="01:53:24.010" style="s2">day kind of made me think of Nikes motto</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.050" end="01:53:25.689" style="s2">just do it yeah I thought cool but um my</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.010" end="01:53:27.789" style="s2">question was that when you were talking</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.689" end="01:53:33.119" style="s2">about circumcision being a contractual</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.789" end="01:53:36.070" style="s2">relationship between sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.119" end="01:53:38.050" style="s2">compared it to a girl having a period</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.070" end="01:53:43.360" style="s2">that didn&#39;t make a lot of sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.050" end="01:53:48.030" style="s2">but also it seems to me that it being a</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.360" end="01:53:48.030" style="s2">sacrifice requires some form of</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.989" end="01:53:52.959" style="s2">willingness basically from the one have</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.639" end="01:53:57.340" style="s2">extreme precision they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.959" end="01:53:58.659" style="s2">want to put forward what you did you</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.340" end="01:54:01.119" style="s2">said you specifically didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.659" end="01:54:02.709" style="s2">address as two infants not having any</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.119" end="01:54:06.459" style="s2">choice in the matter but more in the</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.709" end="01:54:08.439" style="s2">context of it being a sacrifice how does</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.459" end="01:54:10.689" style="s2">that I think I think that&#39;s how a modern</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.439" end="01:54:12.280" style="s2">person would see it and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.689" end="01:54:14.979" style="s2">there&#39;s some I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.280" end="01:54:17.079" style="s2">utility in that but but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.979" end="01:54:18.669" style="s2">an incomplete incomplete to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.079" end="01:54:20.559" style="s2">you know because one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.669" end="01:54:21.909" style="s2">happens with God neighbor ham is that</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.559" end="01:54:25.030" style="s2">God tells Abraham that he has to take</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.909" end="01:54:26.860" style="s2">care of his family his children now the</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.030" end="01:54:29.429" style="s2">question is exactly how do you take care</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.860" end="01:54:32.340" style="s2">of your children and the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.429" end="01:54:34.809" style="s2">sometimes you make decisions for them</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.340" end="01:54:36.070" style="s2">now you might say well be better if they</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.809" end="01:54:39.789" style="s2">could make the decisions for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.070" end="01:54:41.289" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually the case so you</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.789" end="01:54:42.550" style="s2">might say well I won&#39;t bring my kids to</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.289" end="01:54:44.039" style="s2">church because it&#39;d be better if they</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.550" end="01:54:46.860" style="s2">could make the decision for themselves</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.039" end="01:54:49.119" style="s2">that&#39;s what I did with my kids you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.860" end="01:54:51.729" style="s2">but I&#39;m not so sure that was a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.119" end="01:54:53.320" style="s2">and the reason I&#39;m not so sure it was a</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.729" end="01:54:56.889" style="s2">good idea was because there are a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.320" end="01:54:58.120" style="s2">of things they didn&#39;t learn now the</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.889" end="01:55:00.130" style="s2">degree to which a parent should</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.120" end="01:55:04.000" style="s2">exercise control over his or her child</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.130" end="01:55:06.340" style="s2">is indeterminate but I guess the hope is</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.000" end="01:55:08.290" style="s2">that you exercise the minimum amount of</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.340" end="01:55:10.330" style="s2">control necessary to maximize the</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.290" end="01:55:12.190" style="s2">child&#39;s probability of success and that</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.330" end="01:55:14.740" style="s2">certainly requires adopting</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.190" end="01:55:16.300" style="s2">responsibility for making decisions as</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.740" end="01:55:18.310" style="s2">well because the child can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.300" end="01:55:19.810" style="s2">decisions you know you can&#39;t just let</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.310" end="01:55:21.610" style="s2">the child lay there and make decisions</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.810" end="01:55:23.950" style="s2">right there&#39;s that&#39;s just not going to</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.610" end="01:55:26.710" style="s2">happen and so you might say well Abraham</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.950" end="01:55:30.130" style="s2">has no right to impose something like</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.710" end="01:55:32.170" style="s2">circumcision on his children and because</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.130" end="01:55:33.190" style="s2">it and the and because it&#39;s a sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.170" end="01:55:35.290" style="s2">it&#39;s something that they should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.190" end="01:55:37.930" style="s2">themselves but the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.290" end="01:55:40.240" style="s2">that Abraham also has no right to</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.930" end="01:55:42.610" style="s2">abdicate his responsibility to his</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.240" end="01:55:46.030" style="s2">children in the name of some</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.610" end="01:55:48.280" style="s2">hypothetical mercifulness and those two</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.030" end="01:55:50.440" style="s2">things have to be balanced well just</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.280" end="01:55:52.420" style="s2">according to the story Abraham got the</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.440" end="01:55:54.640" style="s2">balance right because of course he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.420" end="01:55:55.990" style="s2">made this covenant with God now exactly</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.640" end="01:55:58.330" style="s2">what that means in people&#39;s day-to-day</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.990" end="01:56:03.820" style="s2">lives well that&#39;s a harder issue but I</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.330" end="01:56:07.710" style="s2">would say I think in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.820" end="01:56:10.240" style="s2">people err on the side of I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.710" end="01:56:11.830" style="s2">think they&#39;re more likely to err on the</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.240" end="01:56:13.830" style="s2">side of taking insufficient</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.830" end="01:56:16.690" style="s2">responsibility for their children</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.830" end="01:56:18.790" style="s2">letting them be free in ways that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.690" end="01:56:20.350" style="s2">productive that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.790" end="01:56:25.240" style="s2">often because they&#39;re afraid of their</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.350" end="01:56:27.690" style="s2">children so that&#39;s about the best I can</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.240" end="01:56:27.690" style="s2">do without</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.800" end="01:56:37.349" style="s2">dr. Peterson I was recently I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.130" end="01:56:39.510" style="s2">recently started reading maps of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.349" end="01:56:41.159" style="s2">and there was something in the</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.510" end="01:56:42.840" style="s2">introduction to that story that I found</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.159" end="01:56:45.149" style="s2">particularly the introduction that you</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.840" end="01:56:49.189" style="s2">wrote before you went and tell them that</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.149" end="01:56:51.570" style="s2">I found particularly compelling I guess</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.189" end="01:56:53.070" style="s2">the part when you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.570" end="01:56:55.679" style="s2">split that developed in your psyche when</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.070" end="01:56:56.820" style="s2">you were you know yeah all your yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.679" end="01:56:58.199" style="s2">think he talked about it one of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.820" end="01:56:59.969" style="s2">earlier lecture I talked about it a</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.199" end="01:57:03.149" style="s2">little bit today yeah a little bit today</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.969" end="01:57:06.659" style="s2">as well yeah you said something in that</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.149" end="01:57:08.760" style="s2">paragraph there that what you said was</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.659" end="01:57:11.849" style="s2">you have to earn the right to identify</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.760" end="01:57:14.579" style="s2">with an idea yeah certain ideas for sure</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.849" end="01:57:16.289" style="s2">than ideas for sure so basically my</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.579" end="01:57:18.719" style="s2">question is how should a young person</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.289" end="01:57:21.959" style="s2">such as myself who doesn&#39;t have a whole</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.719" end="01:57:24.269" style="s2">lot of life experience like be able to</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.959" end="01:57:25.829" style="s2">like read literature and psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.269" end="01:57:27.840" style="s2">interact with you know the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.829" end="01:57:29.610" style="s2">culture and then incorporate it into a</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.840" end="01:57:33.149" style="s2">structure that still authentically their</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.610" end="01:57:34.679" style="s2">own well look I think the way you ask</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.149" end="01:57:38.719" style="s2">that question means that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.679" end="01:57:38.719" style="s2">doing a pretty good job of that well I</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.769" end="01:57:44.369" style="s2">well I mean I mean that because that was</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.449" end="01:57:45.809" style="s2">a very carefully formulated question and</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.369" end="01:57:47.820" style="s2">it was obvious that you were actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.809" end="01:57:49.469" style="s2">looking for an answer instead of trying</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.820" end="01:57:51.899" style="s2">to tell the audience a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.469" end="01:57:54.059" style="s2">that you knew which often happens with</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.899" end="01:57:56.130" style="s2">questions right and it&#39;s alright often</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.059" end="01:57:57.959" style="s2">it&#39;s very annoying for the audience to</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.130" end="01:58:01.070" style="s2">be subject to questions like that right</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.959" end="01:58:01.070" style="s2">because it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="01:58:03.390" end="01:58:08.350" style="s2">because it&#39;s a form of manipulation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.950" end="01:58:11.560" style="s2">like well I&#39;ll cap this off with the</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.350" end="01:58:13.719" style="s2">question but actually it&#39;s a speech so</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.560" end="01:58:16.420" style="s2">so I would say you probably already know</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.719" end="01:58:17.920" style="s2">the answer to that and but then I could</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.420" end="01:58:19.810" style="s2">elaborate on that a little bit is like</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.920" end="01:58:23.110" style="s2">there are a lot of books that people</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.810" end="01:58:24.489" style="s2">have historically regarded as great you</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.110" end="01:58:27.850" style="s2">might as well start by assuming that</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.489" end="01:58:31.530" style="s2">they&#39;re at least greater than you right</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.850" end="01:58:34.810" style="s2">and then and to approach them with that</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.530" end="01:58:37.810" style="s2">frame of mind because even if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.810" end="01:58:40.320" style="s2">much in them that perhaps is no longer</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.810" end="01:58:42.640" style="s2">relevant often less than people assume</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.320" end="01:58:45.610" style="s2">there&#39;s much in them that will be of</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.640" end="01:58:48.820" style="s2">extreme benefit to you and then with</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.610" end="01:58:50.580" style="s2">regards to making them yours the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.820" end="01:58:53.590" style="s2">wisdom that you get from great books is</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.580" end="01:58:55.780" style="s2">practical wisdom and you act it out and</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.590" end="01:58:58.210" style="s2">so then what you do is you try to</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.780" end="01:59:00.580" style="s2">incorporate what you learn into your</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.210" end="01:59:02.050" style="s2">life into your practices and then if you</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.580" end="01:59:04.480" style="s2">incorporate it into your life and your</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.050" end="01:59:07.030" style="s2">practices you build a bridge between you</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.480" end="01:59:09.010" style="s2">and the great idea right because you</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.030" end="01:59:10.600" style="s2">figured out how to manifest itself in</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.010" end="01:59:12.719" style="s2">the conditions of your own life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.600" end="01:59:15.790" style="s2">something like making the archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.719" end="01:59:17.800" style="s2">personal which is which is the right</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.790" end="01:59:19.780" style="s2">thing to do right it&#39;s the proper thing</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.800" end="01:59:22.600" style="s2">to do because that expands your life</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.780" end="01:59:26.200" style="s2">upward and outward and in Nobel&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.600" end="01:59:27.610" style="s2">and brings you up as well but so</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.200" end="01:59:30.130" style="s2">humility is part of it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.610" end="01:59:34.090" style="s2">approach these books as if they have</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.130" end="01:59:35.710" style="s2">something to teach you and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.090" end="01:59:39.400" style="s2">humility again in the second places</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.710" end="01:59:42.820" style="s2">don&#39;t take the ideas to yourself until</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.400" end="01:59:44.380" style="s2">you live them there&#39;ll be lots of time</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.820" end="01:59:45.940" style="s2">for that and besides you know even as a</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.380" end="01:59:48.910" style="s2">young person it&#39;s not like you have</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.940" end="01:59:51.040" style="s2">nothing to say but the only things that</p>
<p begin="01:59:48.910" end="01:59:53.440" style="s2">you have to say are your things to say</p>
<p begin="01:59:51.040" end="01:59:54.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s not necessarily that easy to</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.440" end="01:59:56.140" style="s2">figure out what they are but as I said</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.760" end="01:59:58.270" style="s2">you did a fine job of that when you</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.140" end="02:00:00.820" style="s2">asked the question so I think I think as</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.270" end="02:00:04.270" style="s2">far as I can tell you already know what</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.820" end="02:00:07.920" style="s2">to do so good do it read everything</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.270" end="02:00:07.920" style="s2">great you can get your damn hands on</p>
<p begin="02:00:12.240" end="02:00:20.740" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson so a lot of your work</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.260" end="02:00:23.070" style="s2">a lot of your lectures recommend the</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.740" end="02:00:28.290" style="s2">audience tackle life with a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.070" end="02:00:31.270" style="s2">attention and intention and you know in</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.290" end="02:00:32.860" style="s2">my kind of personal gateway drug to</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.270" end="02:00:36.730" style="s2">philosophy has been more Eastern</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.860" end="02:00:41.410" style="s2">philosophy and like the bug hood gita</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.730" end="02:00:46.210" style="s2">and the work of Alan Watts and tower&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.410" end="02:00:47.980" style="s2">Calvinism and what I&#39;ve noticed I may be</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.210" end="02:00:51.030" style="s2">wrong but this is a common theme in</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.980" end="02:00:58.290" style="s2">Eastern philosophy which is more passive</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.030" end="02:01:01.960" style="s2">non action don&#39;t make as many plans I</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.290" end="02:01:03.700" style="s2">wonder how you reconcile that in how you</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.960" end="02:01:05.650" style="s2">are reconciling that because you</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.700" end="02:01:09.220" style="s2">mentioned earlier in previous lectures</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.650" end="02:01:13.020" style="s2">that you&#39;ve read the TEL teaching how do</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.220" end="02:01:13.020" style="s2">you reconcile those two different views</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.830" end="02:01:19.630" style="s2">well I think first that the daodejing in</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.010" end="02:01:23.500" style="s2">particular isn&#39;t about inaction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.630" end="02:01:27.220" style="s2">about minimal proper action and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.500" end="02:01:30.340" style="s2">also about minimal proper action after a</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.220" end="02:01:32.830" style="s2">tremendous amount of sacrifice right so</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.340" end="02:01:36.250" style="s2">the sage that&#39;s speaking forth in the</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.830" end="02:01:38.140" style="s2">Dao de Jing has already let go of almost</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.250" end="02:01:41.080" style="s2">everything that he needs to let go of</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.140" end="02:01:43.320" style="s2">and a tremendous amount of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:01:41.080" end="02:01:45.700" style="s2">reading in the Eastern philosophies is</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.320" end="02:01:48.280" style="s2">predicated I think at least in part on</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.700" end="02:01:49.810" style="s2">the idea of sacrifice there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.280" end="02:01:52.570" style="s2">things that you&#39;re grabbing on to like</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.810" end="02:01:55.390" style="s2">the monkey you know with the jar that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.570" end="02:01:57.640" style="s2">actually causing your misery and so</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.390" end="02:01:59.680" style="s2">sometimes letting go is the right way of</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.640" end="02:02:03.400" style="s2">moving ahead but to me that ties into</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.680" end="02:02:05.770" style="s2">this idea of sacrifice so now whether</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.400" end="02:02:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s more than that whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.770" end="02:02:09.280" style="s2">more intentionality in Western</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.600" end="02:02:11.850" style="s2">philosophy and less intentionality in</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.280" end="02:02:14.530" style="s2">Eastern philosophy I&#39;m not exactly sure</p>
<p begin="02:02:11.850" end="02:02:17.500" style="s2">one way of mediating between those two</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.530" end="02:02:20.659" style="s2">was was formulated at least in part by</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.500" end="02:02:22.999" style="s2">Carl Jung he pointed out that</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.659" end="02:02:26.629" style="s2">the archetypal figure for what the last</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.999" end="02:02:31.639" style="s2">died at 32 and so to some degree that</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.629" end="02:02:36.079" style="s2">outgoing extroverted let&#39;s say nature of</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.639" end="02:02:38.329" style="s2">the West is a consequence of its</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.079" end="02:02:44.059" style="s2">youthfulness in some sense it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.329" end="02:02:47.119" style="s2">ethos and that the East Buddha died at a</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.059" end="02:02:49.449" style="s2">fairly ripe old age and even in the</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.119" end="02:02:51.889" style="s2">Hindu practices if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.449" end="02:02:54.739" style="s2">for many Hindu temples there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.889" end="02:02:57.050" style="s2">erotic sculptures an idea is something</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.739" end="02:02:58.820" style="s2">like it can&#39;t get past the damn erotic</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.050" end="02:03:01.070" style="s2">sculptures it&#39;s not time to go into the</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.820" end="02:03:03.050" style="s2">temple but it&#39;s more than that it might</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.070" end="02:03:05.439" style="s2">also be that if you&#39;re young it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.050" end="02:03:08.719" style="s2">time to get past the erotic sculptures</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.439" end="02:03:12.079" style="s2">so maybe maybe there&#39;s a moving forward</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.719" end="02:03:15.429" style="s2">into life in youth and a letting go in</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.079" end="02:03:18.709" style="s2">in the latter part of life and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.429" end="02:03:20.989" style="s2">well that was Jung&#39;s way of mediating</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.709" end="02:03:23.449" style="s2">between those two traditions I think</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.989" end="02:03:25.449" style="s2">they&#39;re tightly aligned with regards to</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.449" end="02:03:27.829" style="s2">the importance of sacrifice it</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.449" end="02:03:31.159" style="s2">frequently is the case that it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.829" end="02:03:33.949" style="s2">desire Maya let&#39;s say your desire that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.159" end="02:03:37.159" style="s2">causing your suffering right and so</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.949" end="02:03:38.780" style="s2">there&#39;s an emphasis in Buddhism even</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.159" end="02:03:42.349" style="s2">more than in Taoism I would say on</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.780" end="02:03:45.739" style="s2">letting go letting go of what&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.349" end="02:03:48.439" style="s2">you miserable and but do you remember</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.739" end="02:03:50.359" style="s2">the thing about Buddha is that he got</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.439" end="02:03:54.169" style="s2">enlightened under the bow tree right</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.359" end="02:03:57.649" style="s2">he basically stepped into the City of</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.169" end="02:04:01.099" style="s2">God he stepped into nirvana and he could</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.649" end="02:04:02.780" style="s2">have stayed there but he chose to come</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.099" end="02:04:06.829" style="s2">back because he decided that he had a</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.780" end="02:04:09.249" style="s2">responsibility to rectify suffering in</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.829" end="02:04:12.019" style="s2">the rest of the world that it was not</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.249" end="02:04:16.010" style="s2">sufficient for him to be enlightened</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.019" end="02:04:18.859" style="s2">well everything else was left in a state</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.010" end="02:04:22.179" style="s2">of insufficiency and suffering and so I</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.859" end="02:04:27.829" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call that inaction you know</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.179" end="02:04:30.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a I&#39;ve made the mistake myself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:27.829" end="02:04:33.169" style="s2">in action versus non action I actually</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.709" end="02:04:34.370" style="s2">had to look up that&#39;s that good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.169" end="02:04:36.530" style="s2">well not</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.370" end="02:04:38.420" style="s2">- really the daodejing does a very good</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.530" end="02:04:41.780" style="s2">job of distinguishing between those two</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.420" end="02:04:43.580" style="s2">because non-action is the minimum</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.780" end="02:04:48.200" style="s2">necessary action to keep the balance</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.580" end="02:04:50.480" style="s2">between order and chaos proper right at</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.200" end="02:04:54.020" style="s2">the end in the egg and the Dao de Jing</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.480" end="02:04:58.700" style="s2">is very very emphatic about this you</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.020" end="02:05:00.650" style="s2">detach and you watch and when it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="02:04:58.700" end="02:05:04.090" style="s2">to intervene you intervene minimally</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.650" end="02:05:08.660" style="s2">without a lot of arrogant self</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.090" end="02:05:10.610" style="s2">propagandize ation and you tap and if</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.660" end="02:05:12.380" style="s2">you do that properly you hardly have to</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.610" end="02:05:16.280" style="s2">do it at all and it&#39;s as if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.380" end="02:05:18.440" style="s2">nothing and there&#39;s this great wisdom in</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.280" end="02:05:22.100" style="s2">that book I really like the Dow teaching</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.440" end="02:05:24.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a remarkable document and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.100" end="02:05:26.630" style="s2">seen managers who were like that who are</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.800" end="02:05:29.900" style="s2">really good at running their company who</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.630" end="02:05:32.510" style="s2">did nothing Lauren but and what they did</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.900" end="02:05:34.670" style="s2">well but that but first of all they set</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.510" end="02:05:36.350" style="s2">up people to replace them because</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.670" end="02:05:37.760" style="s2">they&#39;re Dirk idea was well if I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.350" end="02:05:39.620" style="s2">really good manager then this place</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.760" end="02:05:41.870" style="s2">could run without me there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.620" end="02:05:44.450" style="s2">humility in that let me just kind of</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.870" end="02:05:46.160" style="s2">wandered around the place talking to</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.450" end="02:05:48.110" style="s2">people and if there was a bit of a</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.160" end="02:05:52.280" style="s2">problem then they just you know turned</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.110" end="02:05:54.080" style="s2">the knob the tenth of a degree and the</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.280" end="02:05:55.670" style="s2">place ran smoothly and it was as if they</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.080" end="02:05:58.460" style="s2">were doing nothing and what they were</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.670" end="02:06:01.400" style="s2">doing was detaching so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.460" end="02:06:03.830" style="s2">being buried by their current concerns</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.400" end="02:06:06.550" style="s2">they were watching to see what was going</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.830" end="02:06:10.100" style="s2">on and then they were minimally</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.550" end="02:06:15.110" style="s2">interacting and that worked like a charm</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.100" end="02:06:16.850" style="s2">so I think that the I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.110" end="02:06:18.260" style="s2">idea that all religious traditions are</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.850" end="02:06:20.720" style="s2">the same because that just makes them</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.260" end="02:06:23.840" style="s2">into like a gray mass but I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.720" end="02:06:26.570" style="s2">that there&#39;s any difference there that</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.840" end="02:06:28.190" style="s2">can&#39;t be bridged I think as you look</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.570" end="02:06:30.670" style="s2">into the details the bridge has become</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.190" end="02:06:30.670" style="s2">more clear</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.210" end="02:06:41.110" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.880" end="02:06:42.790" style="s2">I&#39;ll get you to speak into the</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.110" end="02:06:46.600" style="s2">microphone especially when you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.790" end="02:06:54.040" style="s2">self-deprecating things let everybody</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.600" end="02:06:56.320" style="s2">hear you okay I much my pleasure what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.040" end="02:07:00.670" style="s2">happened what&#39;s happened to you as a</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.320" end="02:07:03.340" style="s2">consequence yeah yeah well our view</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.670" end="02:07:06.040" style="s2">seeing it that way anyways well mainly</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.340" end="02:07:07.810" style="s2">on I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve had whatever you say</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.040" end="02:07:10.660" style="s2">right it&#39;s something I thought but not</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.810" end="02:07:12.340" style="s2">had been able to articulate right so</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.660" end="02:07:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s been very helpful in that regards</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.340" end="02:07:18.880" style="s2">and kind of saving a lot of time no yep</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.040" end="02:07:20.410" style="s2">good good good good my main question is</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.880" end="02:07:22.090" style="s2">actually on something you said a couple</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.410" end="02:07:29.380" style="s2">lectures ago it was something along the</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.090" end="02:07:31.630" style="s2">lines of a family um so I think I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.380" end="02:07:33.670" style="s2">god that&#39;s the history of your family</p>

<p begin="02:07:38.400" end="02:07:45.969" style="s2">how can you stand on that one well</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.199" end="02:07:49.840" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.969" end="02:07:52.870" style="s2">that your sins might be visited unto</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.840" end="02:07:56.530" style="s2">your family seven generations down seems</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.870" end="02:07:58.000" style="s2">kind of harsh but you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.530" end="02:08:01.210" style="s2">confronting maybe your father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.000" end="02:08:02.830" style="s2">tyrannical yeah but you know maybe his</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.210" end="02:08:05.290" style="s2">father beat the hell out of him and</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.830" end="02:08:07.870" style="s2">maybe his father&#39;s father was a vicious</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.290" end="02:08:11.080" style="s2">alcoholic and he just bloody well don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.870" end="02:08:12.910" style="s2">know how far back that goes and and that</p>
<p begin="02:08:11.080" end="02:08:15.400" style="s2">means also you don&#39;t exactly know what</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.910" end="02:08:17.020" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with right to some degree</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.400" end="02:08:18.670" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with your father but only</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.020" end="02:08:21.219" style="s2">partly what you&#39;re dealing with is the</p>
<p begin="02:08:18.670" end="02:08:23.290" style="s2">pathological paternal spirit something</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.219" end="02:08:24.489" style="s2">like that and it&#39;s better to think about</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.290" end="02:08:26.890" style="s2">that way because it becomes an</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.489" end="02:08:29.230" style="s2">existential issue at that point you know</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.890" end="02:08:31.480" style="s2">so you could say that while the father</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.230" end="02:08:33.070" style="s2">has two components and I mean this</p>
<p begin="02:08:31.480" end="02:08:34.780" style="s2">psychologically speaking there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:08:33.070" end="02:08:37.449" style="s2">Great Father that&#39;s beneficial and</p>
<p begin="02:08:34.780" end="02:08:39.250" style="s2">protective and that that organizes</p>
<p begin="02:08:37.449" end="02:08:40.840" style="s2">society and teaches you how to speak and</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.250" end="02:08:42.340" style="s2">has produced all these wonderful things</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.840" end="02:08:45.640" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.340" end="02:08:47.380" style="s2">oppressive part of the father just like</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.640" end="02:08:48.619" style="s2">there&#39;s the terrible part of mother</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.380" end="02:08:49.940" style="s2">nature that&#39;s destroy</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.619" end="02:08:51.889" style="s2">than the benevolent part of mother</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.940" end="02:08:54.860" style="s2">nature that&#39;s wonderful and productive</p>
<p begin="02:08:51.889" end="02:08:56.869" style="s2">and you&#39;re stuck with that right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.860" end="02:08:58.969" style="s2">stuck with having to mediate between</p>
<p begin="02:08:56.869" end="02:09:00.830" style="s2">those opposing forces just like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:08:58.969" end="02:09:02.420" style="s2">stuck with the adversarial part of</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.830" end="02:09:04.429" style="s2">yourself and the heroic part of yourself</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.420" end="02:09:07.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s up to you to set those things</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.429" end="02:09:10.460" style="s2">right otherwise they propagate into the</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.250" end="02:09:11.830" style="s2">future and it isn&#39;t it straightforward</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.460" end="02:09:15.849" style="s2">thing to say how to set them right</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.830" end="02:09:20.270" style="s2">there&#39;s quite a good movie about that oh</p>

<p begin="02:11:27.929" end="02:11:34.079" style="s2">part of I think what you do when you</p>

<p begin="02:11:42.119" end="02:11:47.099" style="s2">nature and of themselves and so you lock</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.659" end="02:11:49.409" style="s2">horns with that and straighten it out</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.099" end="02:11:52.230" style="s2">one way or another and you don&#39;t move it</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.409" end="02:11:54.750" style="s2">forward to the next generation so and</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.230" end="02:11:59.449" style="s2">maybe you detach it a bit from your</p>

<p begin="02:13:38.480" end="02:13:43.639" style="s2">multiplies is because sensible people</p>

<p begin="02:17:24.389" end="02:17:31.050" style="s2">a point to standing up when it appears</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.450" end="02:17:32.490" style="s2">to be futile well the first thing I</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.050" end="02:17:37.229" style="s2">think is you convince them that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.490" end="02:17:40.080" style="s2">futile it might be difficult but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.229" end="02:17:42.090" style="s2">not futile if you get your words right</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.080" end="02:17:44.580" style="s2">you have something to say</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.090" end="02:17:46.050" style="s2">there&#39;ll be an impact of those words it</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.580" end="02:17:47.969" style="s2">might not be the impact that you would</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.050" end="02:17:52.260" style="s2">choose but but the other thing you got</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.969" end="02:17:54.780" style="s2">to tell people is pick your poison you</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.260" end="02:17:57.389" style="s2">don&#39;t you may be in a situation where</p>

<p begin="02:17:58.830" end="02:18:03.690" style="s2">you got tyranny or famine those are your</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.650" end="02:18:07.139" style="s2">choices but you get to pick which one</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.690" end="02:18:09.809" style="s2">you have and I would say if if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.139" end="02:18:12.840" style="s2">being oppressed and I mean in your soul</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.809" end="02:18:15.479" style="s2">by what you&#39;re required to swallow at</p>

<p begin="02:18:15.479" end="02:18:21.900" style="s2">price for that you have no self-respect</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.150" end="02:18:24.630" style="s2">and and rightly so but worse than that</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.900" end="02:18:27.059" style="s2">you&#39;re an agent of your own destruction</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.630" end="02:18:29.219" style="s2">you&#39;re destroying your own ideal and</p>

<p begin="02:18:29.219" end="02:18:36.510" style="s2">corrupt win and if you stood up and and</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.590" end="02:18:38.219" style="s2">stood up property but you have to put</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.510" end="02:18:39.510" style="s2">yourself in order to do this at least to</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.219" end="02:18:42.030" style="s2">some degree right you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.510" end="02:18:44.570" style="s2">casually you have to do it from some</p>

<p begin="02:18:44.570" end="02:18:49.460" style="s2">then what makes you think you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.250" end="02:18:53.099" style="s2">scare them back into the corners and</p>
<p begin="02:18:49.460" end="02:18:55.860" style="s2">that would be a good thing and you know</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.099" end="02:18:56.460" style="s2">the alternative personally is bad</p>

<p begin="02:20:20.970" end="02:20:24.570" style="s2">him today said well he went to a</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.560" end="02:20:28.020" style="s2">diversity training seminar and he</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.570" end="02:20:30.570" style="s2">thought no I don&#39;t agree with that and</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.020" end="02:20:32.760" style="s2">so then they asked for feedback so we</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.570" end="02:20:35.160" style="s2">wrote this document a month ago this was</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.760" end="02:20:37.500" style="s2">written a month ago got no real response</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.160" end="02:20:39.840" style="s2">to it but bounced around inside Google</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.500" end="02:20:41.460" style="s2">until a lot of people you know got</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.840" end="02:20:45.330" style="s2">interested and then it escaped into the</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.460" end="02:20:47.580" style="s2">outside world but all he was doing was</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.330" end="02:20:49.470" style="s2">he was told a bunch of things he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.580" end="02:20:51.960" style="s2">think were true he wrote down a bunch of</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.470" end="02:20:53.460" style="s2">things he thought were probably true he</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.960" end="02:20:55.770" style="s2">launched that out and said well I think</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.460" end="02:21:00.479" style="s2">these things are probably true it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.770" end="02:21:02.220" style="s2">well probably they&#39;re true well so he</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.479" end="02:21:03.780" style="s2">paid a price for it but maybe we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.220" end="02:21:05.010" style="s2">what sort of price he paid for it man</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.780" end="02:21:09.320" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a lot tougher in two</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.010" end="02:21:09.320" style="s2">years than he was two years ago so</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.370" end="02:21:18.490" style="s2">no they didn&#39;t answer his feedback</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.870" end="02:21:20.320" style="s2">no no but well you can watch the video</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.490" end="02:21:23.050" style="s2">the story&#39;s there but that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.320" end="02:21:24.610" style="s2">outline of it so sorry to monopolize</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.050" end="02:21:27.150" style="s2">this so I have one other question about</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.610" end="02:21:29.410" style="s2">this and I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.150" end="02:21:32.141" style="s2">aside from Google just being a workplace</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.410" end="02:21:34.420" style="s2">right it also controls the own YouTube</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.141" end="02:21:40.960" style="s2">right yes which in order how is the new</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.420" end="02:21:43.271" style="s2">censorship scheme and it controls a huge</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.960" end="02:21:46.150" style="s2">amount of the information that people</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.271" end="02:21:50.800" style="s2">get then so true and so what happens to</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.150" end="02:21:53.790" style="s2">society when companies such as Google</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.800" end="02:21:57.160" style="s2">which control our information start to</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.790" end="02:21:59.110" style="s2">censor not just how about themselves and</p>
<p begin="02:21:57.160" end="02:22:00.521" style="s2">and maybe the information that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="02:21:59.110" end="02:22:04.271" style="s2">out to the rest of the world how much is</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.521" end="02:22:05.500" style="s2">this already happening and how much how</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.271" end="02:22:08.470" style="s2">about if we what happened how about if</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.500" end="02:22:10.870" style="s2">we refused to find out that would be</p>
<p begin="02:22:08.470" end="02:22:13.650" style="s2">good you know like I reviewed this this</p>
<p begin="02:22:10.870" end="02:22:16.720" style="s2">guy&#39;s document I did that yesterday and</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.650" end="02:22:18.160" style="s2">everything he said was validated by the</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.720" end="02:22:20.891" style="s2">scientific literature so what has</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.160" end="02:22:23.681" style="s2">happened is that someone has been fired</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.891" end="02:22:26.431" style="s2">publicly by major corporation for</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.681" end="02:22:29.230" style="s2">stating well-grounded scientific truths</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.431" end="02:22:30.880" style="s2">right there are exactly the sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.230" end="02:22:32.320" style="s2">things that I say in my classes for</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.880" end="02:22:33.790" style="s2">example and the reason that I say them</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.320" end="02:22:35.980" style="s2">is because I read the literature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.790" end="02:22:38.771" style="s2">not because I&#39;m personally happy about</p>
<p begin="02:22:35.980" end="02:22:41.080" style="s2">the facts I think I cube research</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.771" end="02:22:43.150" style="s2">particularly is so dismal that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.080" end="02:22:45.550" style="s2">possibly read it without being seriously</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.150" end="02:22:48.490" style="s2">disheartened if I could reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.550" end="02:22:52.530" style="s2">world so that IQ the IQ research wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.490" end="02:22:56.380" style="s2">true well it&#39;d sure be tempting you know</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.530" end="02:22:58.030" style="s2">but that&#39;s not how science works science</p>
<p begin="02:22:56.380" end="02:22:59.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t tell you what you what you want</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.030" end="02:23:03.101" style="s2">to hear it just tells you the way it</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.650" end="02:23:08.530" style="s2">bloody well is and he got pilloried for</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.101" end="02:23:10.870" style="s2">he got pilloried for revealing a good</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.530" end="02:23:14.050" style="s2">fraction of current scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.870" end="02:23:17.230" style="s2">about gender differences okay that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.050" end="02:23:18.460" style="s2">good and as you said that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="02:23:17.230" end="02:23:22.670" style="s2">company and it controls our</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.460" end="02:23:25.520" style="s2">communication how about we do</p>
<p begin="02:23:22.670" end="02:23:28.430" style="s2">what we can to ensure that these large</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.520" end="02:23:33.850" style="s2">communication companies don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.430" end="02:23:37.729" style="s2">impose a factually false ideological</p>
<p begin="02:23:33.850" end="02:23:39.950" style="s2">structure on the rest of the planet well</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.729" end="02:23:41.420" style="s2">you can think about supporting this this</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.950" end="02:23:43.790" style="s2">guy who blew the whistle there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.420" end="02:23:50.050" style="s2">fundraiser for him online he could use</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.790" end="02:23:50.050" style="s2">some money he wants to sue Google yeah</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.640" end="02:23:57.530" style="s2">you know maybe we could maybe we could</p>
<p begin="02:23:55.189" end="02:24:00.500" style="s2">let them know that hiring a human</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.530" end="02:24:02.660" style="s2">resources director who&#39;s also concerned</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.500" end="02:24:05.360" style="s2">with equity is probably not a good idea</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.660" end="02:24:08.210" style="s2">for capitalist company why in the world</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.360" end="02:24:11.630" style="s2">would you hire your own enemies I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.210" end="02:24:14.240" style="s2">understand that so well we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.630" end="02:24:18.620" style="s2">the dialogue continues but back to the</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.240" end="02:24:21.430" style="s2">personal like you need to say what you</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.620" end="02:24:23.840" style="s2">think because that&#39;s where you come from</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.430" end="02:24:26.120" style="s2">right and if you don&#39;t say what you</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.840" end="02:24:28.310" style="s2">think then you kill your unborn self</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.120" end="02:24:30.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what you do that&#39;s what Cain did</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.310" end="02:24:32.630" style="s2">when he killed Abel and that&#39;s why his</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.500" end="02:24:34.100" style="s2">punishment was unbearable you know you</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.630" end="02:24:35.990" style="s2">have things in you that are struggling</p>
<p begin="02:24:34.100" end="02:24:37.250" style="s2">to come to the light that&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.990" end="02:24:39.229" style="s2">you need daughter and you need to either</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.250" end="02:24:41.450" style="s2">that truth because without that truth</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.229" end="02:24:43.370" style="s2">you cannot live in the world because the</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.450" end="02:24:45.320" style="s2">world is real and you need truth to live</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.370" end="02:24:48.290" style="s2">in the world and if you stifle your</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.320" end="02:24:50.570" style="s2">truth well how how can that be anything</p>
<p begin="02:24:48.290" end="02:24:53.090" style="s2">but something that brings about hell how</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.570" end="02:24:54.800" style="s2">could it be any other way so you think</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.090" end="02:24:56.689" style="s2">well why should you speak up that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.800" end="02:25:00.439" style="s2">because the consequences of not speaking</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.689" end="02:25:03.229" style="s2">up although delayed are far worse that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.439" end="02:25:05.740" style="s2">the reason that&#39;s the reason if it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.229" end="02:25:09.729" style="s2">be courage it could at least be prudence</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.740" end="02:25:09.729" style="s2">so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.120" end="02:25:19.530" style="s2">one more dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.149" end="02:25:21.540" style="s2">first of all kudos for mentioning</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.530" end="02:25:23.010" style="s2">magnolias in my favorite movie that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.540" end="02:25:26.510" style="s2">great movie man</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.010" end="02:25:28.770" style="s2">so a few months ago I had a dream and</p>
<p begin="02:25:26.510" end="02:25:30.149" style="s2">when I told someone this dream they</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.770" end="02:25:31.080" style="s2">suggested that I read the Book of</p>
<p begin="02:25:30.149" end="02:25:37.080" style="s2">Revelations</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.080" end="02:25:39.450" style="s2">oh yeah that&#39;s a bad dream that the</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.080" end="02:25:43.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of interesting stuff in</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.450" end="02:25:45.600" style="s2">that book the thing that really that I</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.770" end="02:25:52.859" style="s2">found really interesting right off the</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.600" end="02:25:55.890" style="s2">bat was the the state is represented in</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.859" end="02:25:57.300" style="s2">two instances as female positively and</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.890" end="02:25:59.460" style="s2">negatively and I was wondering if you</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.300" end="02:26:02.100" style="s2">had any thoughts on that in the context</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.460" end="02:26:05.100" style="s2">of like in maps of meaning you often</p>
<p begin="02:26:02.100" end="02:26:09.630" style="s2">talk about the state just as as male or</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.100" end="02:26:11.250" style="s2">as masculine okay first of all I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.630" end="02:26:13.320" style="s2">to comment on your t-shirt that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.250" end="02:26:15.960" style="s2">lobster hierarchy with Horus at the top</p>
<p begin="02:26:13.320" end="02:26:21.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s even better it&#39;s the eye</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.960" end="02:26:24.780" style="s2">of a lobster so that&#39;s one that we found</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.630" end="02:26:26.550" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good one that&#39;s a good one</p>
<p begin="02:26:24.780" end="02:26:28.050" style="s2">that one really cracked me up when I saw</p>
<p begin="02:26:26.550" end="02:26:32.160" style="s2">it I really thought that was funny man</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.050" end="02:26:33.990" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah when my graduate students</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.160" end="02:26:36.570" style="s2">used to meet when I first talked about</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.990" end="02:26:38.010" style="s2">this Lobster stuff we meet for breakfast</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.570" end="02:26:40.350" style="s2">day and they were a very combative</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.010" end="02:26:41.399" style="s2">snappy group of graduate students and</p>
<p begin="02:26:40.350" end="02:26:43.710" style="s2">they&#39;re always trying to one-up each</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.399" end="02:26:45.570" style="s2">other with jokes and whenever one really</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.710" end="02:26:51.899" style="s2">pulled a good joke on another they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:26:45.570" end="02:26:54.260" style="s2">stand up and like it was really it was</p>
<p begin="02:26:51.899" end="02:27:03.660" style="s2">really funny it was really funny okay</p>
<p begin="02:26:54.260" end="02:27:05.880" style="s2">let&#39;s see can I answer that question you</p>
<p begin="02:27:03.660" end="02:27:09.090" style="s2">know how if you&#39;re looking at a if you</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.880" end="02:27:11.310" style="s2">look at a room every color that you see</p>
<p begin="02:27:09.090" end="02:27:13.170" style="s2">is dependent on every other color in the</p>
<p begin="02:27:11.310" end="02:27:14.640" style="s2">room right your eyes adjust to that so</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.170" end="02:27:17.280" style="s2">for example if you&#39;re in a room based</p>
<p begin="02:27:14.640" end="02:27:19.170" style="s2">with red light your eyes will in some</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.280" end="02:27:23.340" style="s2">sense remove the red so you can still</p>
<p begin="02:27:19.170" end="02:27:25.680" style="s2">see the colors okay so your perception</p>
<p begin="02:27:23.340" end="02:27:28.550" style="s2">is to some degree on-call is to some</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.680" end="02:27:30.470" style="s2">degree dependent on Khan</p>
<p begin="02:27:28.550" end="02:27:32.090" style="s2">context and that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.470" end="02:27:36.050" style="s2">that makes the symbolic symbolic</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.090" end="02:27:37.310" style="s2">interpretations tricky because to see</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.050" end="02:27:38.600" style="s2">how something is represented</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.310" end="02:27:41.660" style="s2">symbolically you actually have to look</p>
<p begin="02:27:38.600" end="02:27:44.630" style="s2">at the broader narrative context within</p>
<p begin="02:27:41.660" end="02:27:50.319" style="s2">which the symbols are embedded so for</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.630" end="02:27:50.319" style="s2">example you see if I can get this right</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.460" end="02:27:58.280" style="s2">if the story has an island and an ocean</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.750" end="02:28:00.020" style="s2">then the ocean is often symbolically</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.280" end="02:28:02.240" style="s2">feminine and the island is symbolically</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.020" end="02:28:05.149" style="s2">masculine but if the story&#39;s the island</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.240" end="02:28:07.340" style="s2">and the sky then Island often becomes</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.149" end="02:28:09.470" style="s2">symbolically masculine and feminine and</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.340" end="02:28:10.850" style="s2">the sky symbolically masculine and you</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.470" end="02:28:12.890" style="s2">might think well how can the island be</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.850" end="02:28:14.930" style="s2">masculine and feminine at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.890" end="02:28:17.300" style="s2">and the answer is well it depends on</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.930" end="02:28:20.300" style="s2">what what it&#39;s being contrasted with and</p>
<p begin="02:28:17.300" end="02:28:22.520" style="s2">why and so that&#39;s part of the key to the</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.300" end="02:28:25.220" style="s2">change in symbolism in the book of</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.520" end="02:28:28.609" style="s2">Revelation and so it isn&#39;t inevitably</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.220" end="02:28:31.189" style="s2">the case that culture is represented</p>
<p begin="02:28:28.609" end="02:28:34.370" style="s2">with the patriarchal symbolism but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.189" end="02:28:36.680" style="s2">most commonly the case so you know there</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.370" end="02:28:38.540" style="s2">is Mother Russia for example I guess it</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.680" end="02:28:40.729" style="s2">would depend to some degree to on what</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.540" end="02:28:43.250" style="s2">your metaphor is for the state because</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.729" end="02:28:49.100" style="s2">the state can be in all providing mother</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.250" end="02:28:51.710" style="s2">or it can be a judgmental father and it</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.100" end="02:28:53.920" style="s2">it seems that we killed more towards the</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.710" end="02:28:56.300" style="s2">father with regards to terminology</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.920" end="02:28:59.470" style="s2">relating to the state and I think the</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.300" end="02:29:02.830" style="s2">reason for that is because I think human</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.470" end="02:29:05.750" style="s2">hierarchies like chimp hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="02:29:02.830" end="02:29:07.819" style="s2">fundamentally masculine the fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.750" end="02:29:09.740" style="s2">hierarchy is masculine even with chimps</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.819" end="02:29:12.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a female hierarchy but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.740" end="02:29:14.510" style="s2">the female hierarchy is nested within</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.740" end="02:29:16.760" style="s2">the male hierarchy it&#39;s not the case</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.510" end="02:29:18.740" style="s2">with bonobos exactly but I think it is</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.760" end="02:29:20.590" style="s2">the case with human beings and so I</p>
<p begin="02:29:18.740" end="02:29:23.720" style="s2">think we have a strong proclivity to</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.590" end="02:29:25.399" style="s2">masculinize the state but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:29:23.720" end="02:29:27.560" style="s2">mean there aren&#39;t exceptions and in</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.399" end="02:29:29.859" style="s2">symbol symbolic representations are very</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.560" end="02:29:34.130" style="s2">slippery that way because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.859" end="02:29:35.630" style="s2">stamp an entity with a symbol because</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.130" end="02:29:38.330" style="s2">that would be the same as just giving it</p>
<p begin="02:29:35.630" end="02:29:40.729" style="s2">a name right and you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.330" end="02:29:42.110" style="s2">dictionary of symbols where you say well</p>
<p begin="02:29:40.729" end="02:29:44.030" style="s2">you know a house</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.110" end="02:29:46.431" style="s2">always means the psyche it&#39;s like know</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.030" end="02:29:49.940" style="s2">sometimes the house means the psyche but</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.431" end="02:29:52.490" style="s2">it depends on the story and so you have</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.940" end="02:29:55.460" style="s2">to take the the entire structure of the</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.490" end="02:29:56.780" style="s2">narrative into account to determine why</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.460" end="02:29:59.330" style="s2">those particular symbolic</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.780" end="02:30:00.860" style="s2">representations are being used what I</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.330" end="02:30:03.530" style="s2">offered in maps a meaning was kind of a</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.860" end="02:30:05.841" style="s2">shorthand you know generally speaking</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.530" end="02:30:07.820" style="s2">there&#39;s nature positive and negative</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.841" end="02:30:09.591" style="s2">usually feminine generally speaking</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.820" end="02:30:12.200" style="s2">there&#39;s culture positive and negative</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.591" end="02:30:14.811" style="s2">usually masculine and generally speaking</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.200" end="02:30:17.271" style="s2">there&#39;s the individual good and evil</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.811" end="02:30:19.160" style="s2">right heroic an adversarial often</p>
<p begin="02:30:17.271" end="02:30:23.061" style="s2">typically represented as masculine</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.160" end="02:30:25.370" style="s2">especially in adventure stories but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.061" end="02:30:27.740" style="s2">a schema and it&#39;s an interpretive guide</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.370" end="02:30:29.601" style="s2">and not a set of hard and fast rules</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.740" end="02:30:33.351" style="s2">because you&#39;re in the domain of metaphor</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.601" end="02:30:35.950" style="s2">and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a slippery domain so you</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.351" end="02:30:38.360" style="s2">have any luck figuring out your dream</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.950" end="02:30:43.660" style="s2">sorry did you have any luck figuring out</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.360" end="02:30:46.580" style="s2">your dream at least in some parts I</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.660" end="02:30:50.420" style="s2">think there&#39;s different levels of</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.580" end="02:30:53.360" style="s2">analysis I mean one was pretty obvious</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.420" end="02:30:54.290" style="s2">yeah all right all right well thank you</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.360" end="02:31:01.479" style="s2">very much everyone</p>
