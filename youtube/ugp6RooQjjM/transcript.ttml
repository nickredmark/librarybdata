<p begin="00:00:04.730" end="00:00:12.450" style="s2">heart hi my name is Andrew Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.960" end="00:00:15.960" style="s2">welcome to my podcast today I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.450" end="00:00:19.310" style="s2">talk about slavo Z Zack and his article</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.960" end="00:00:23.000" style="s2">in the independent on Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.310" end="00:00:26.970" style="s2">incidentally this is the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.000" end="00:00:29.029" style="s2">medium article I&#39;ve written so far and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.970" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">believe that Z&#39;s ech read it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.029" end="00:00:35.100" style="s2">responded I&#39;m going to put links to that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:36.690" style="s2">that response after I can&#39;t say for</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">certain that he was responding to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.690" end="00:00:44.430" style="s2">particular article but it seemed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:47.219" style="s2">point-by-point rebuttal in many ways so</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.430" end="00:00:49.410" style="s2">again I could be wrong here and I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.219" end="00:00:52.710" style="s2">want to say that I enjoy Z&#39;s ex work</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.410" end="00:00:58.010" style="s2">very much and I just thought his article</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">in the independent was quite weak</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.010" end="00:01:04.739" style="s2">so here goes so I always like slavo Z</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.020" style="s2">check last J I read three massive tones</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:08.909" style="s2">of his work getting lost in the forest</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.020" end="00:01:11.640" style="s2">of Z Zack is like being in a dense</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.909" end="00:01:14.610" style="s2">jungle eventually you get to a clearing</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.640" end="00:01:16.350" style="s2">and discover a flash of insight even if</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.610" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">most of the time you feel somewhat lost</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.350" end="00:01:23.130" style="s2">in an impenetrable tangle of lakhani and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">theory and provocation I kept reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.130" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">him for those flashes of insight and yet</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">I never really got what he stood for his</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">essence remained obscure to me Z Zack is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.579" style="s2">a master storyteller a great comedian a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">feast of words perhaps a black magician</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.579" end="00:01:41.579" style="s2">but this year I also discovered Jordan B</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:43.880" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work and I&#39;ve often meditated</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.579" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">on the differences between the two men</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.880" end="00:01:48.899" style="s2">not just their political differences</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">Peterson calls himself a classic liberal</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.899" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">and Z Zack a communist but there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">essential differences as personality</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">types as well Peterson&#39;s work on the big</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">five personality traits has helped me</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">some in this respect</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">Zizek and Peterson are obviously high in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">trait openness and IQ that is creativity</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">and abstraction but Peterson is far more</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:15.430" style="s2">conscientious and Z Zack is far more</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:17.650" style="s2">Radek the differences can be seen in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.430" end="00:02:20.020" style="s2">body language Peterson suits and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.650" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">gentlemanly demeanor versus Z&#39;s ex</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.020" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">designer t-shirts and wild hair Z&#39;s ex</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:28.330" style="s2">apparent indifference to personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:31.060" style="s2">hygiene and constant twitching versus</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.330" end="00:02:33.459" style="s2">Peterson suits and poised charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.060" end="00:02:34.990" style="s2">presence of course while grooming and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.459" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">style might seem like an irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.990" end="00:02:40.630" style="s2">subject it is also analogous to how they</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:41.980" style="s2">both write and talk Z&#39;s ex comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.630" end="00:02:44.110" style="s2">a huge book every couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.980" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">whereas Peterson spent many years</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.110" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">writing and rewriting his first book</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:51.190" style="s2">maps of meaning Peterson has said that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">he wrote and rewrote every sentence of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.190" end="00:02:56.019" style="s2">that book over ten times to get each</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">word perfect Z&#39;s Eck on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.019" end="00:03:00.959" style="s2">seems to write at the speed he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:03.820" style="s2">and speaks in a voluminous cloud in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.959" end="00:03:05.170" style="s2">interviews Zee Zack tends to swarm his</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.820" end="00:03:07.630" style="s2">opponent in this cloud</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.170" end="00:03:09.820" style="s2">whereas Peterson while he talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.630" end="00:03:14.040" style="s2">appears to listen deeply to what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.820" end="00:03:16.360" style="s2">other is saying recently Z Zack wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.040" end="00:03:18.549" style="s2">uncharacteristically short hit piece on</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.360" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">Peterson in the independent which</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.549" end="00:03:23.079" style="s2">surprised the hell out of me for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:25.180" style="s2">couple of reasons firstly he obviously</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.079" end="00:03:26.920" style="s2">hadn&#39;t done any research and he had</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.180" end="00:03:28.900" style="s2">fallen for every kind of caricature</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.920" end="00:03:31.000" style="s2">which the media has propped up against</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.900" end="00:03:32.920" style="s2">Peterson Peterson has described as an</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:32.180" style="s2">Peterson is a sujud Azure or he did it</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.900" end="00:04:34.830" style="s2">for money</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.660" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">come out against an r and individualism</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.690" end="00:04:52.050" style="s2">isn&#39;t Peterson a bit of a social</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:10.890" style="s2">recently perhaps I want this because I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.370" end="00:06:35.070" style="s2">with zis Eck that the left doesn&#39;t have</p>
