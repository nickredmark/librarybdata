<p begin="00:00:00.079" end="00:00:05.819" style="s2">marriage is clearly an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.540" end="00:00:07.080" style="s2">elaboration on something that in another</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.819" end="00:00:10.040" style="s2">creature would we call mate guarding</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:12.509" style="s2">mate guarding is a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.040" end="00:00:15.719" style="s2">one of the mates typically the male</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.509" end="00:00:20.760" style="s2">follows the female around to ensure that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.719" end="00:00:22.640" style="s2">her progeny is produced by him in human</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.760" end="00:00:26.670" style="s2">beings this has been augmented</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.640" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">tremendously to add all sorts of depth</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.670" end="00:00:33.930" style="s2">and symmetry to the mate guarding and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">fact it looks much closer in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.930" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">to something like what we might see in</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:44.399" style="s2">other monogamous primates in monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:46.860" style="s2">primates individuals will sit together</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.399" end="00:00:48.649" style="s2">and they will actually duet I believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.860" end="00:00:51.660" style="s2">this is true for all monogamous primates</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.649" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">rather than human beings that the male</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">and the female will gather repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">and they will sit on the same branch and</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">sing together so I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:01.800" style="s2">never happens in humans but it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">obligate behavior in humans whereas it</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.800" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">is an applicant behavior in TV monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">and Gibbons and other other monogamous</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">primates the important thing to realize</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:15.030" style="s2">though is that once you have a structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">like mate guarding and then it begins to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.030" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">be elaborated for other purposes that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:22.200" style="s2">all sorts of stuff gets built into that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:27.320" style="s2">relationship and so there&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.200" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">very intensive kind of reciprocation</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.320" end="00:01:34.530" style="s2">within the marital context where males</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">and females are contributing in many</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.530" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">ways equally though not the same things</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:42.899" style="s2">to the relationship and so they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">providing for what ultimately is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.899" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">basis for family that&#39;s that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">purpose of these bonds originally was</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:52.369" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not something that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:55.290" style="s2">has to be maintained we could repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.369" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">marital relationships for for things</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.290" end="00:01:58.860" style="s2">other than producing offspring but that</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">is that is ultimately why the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.860" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">relationship evolved</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.409" end="00:02:12.010" style="s2">in fact most human societies have almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.250" end="00:02:15.489" style="s2">certainly not been monogamous and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.010" end="00:02:18.819" style="s2">can see in the small but measurable bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.489" end="00:02:21.220" style="s2">of size diverse dimorphism in human</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.819" end="00:02:24.819" style="s2">males and human females that there has</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.220" end="00:02:28.269" style="s2">been some history of non-monogamy that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.819" end="00:02:30.459" style="s2">said most people on earth today derive</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.269" end="00:02:33.310" style="s2">from populations that are at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.459" end="00:02:36.220" style="s2">nominally monogamous which begins to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.310" end="00:02:38.400" style="s2">tell an interesting tale the different</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.220" end="00:02:42.040" style="s2">mating systems that we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.400" end="00:02:44.860" style="s2">monogamy one male and one female bonded</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.040" end="00:02:47.410" style="s2">together we have polygyny which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.860" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">male and multiple females we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.410" end="00:02:52.450" style="s2">polyandry which is one female and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:55.930" style="s2">multiple males and we have promiscuity</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.450" end="00:02:59.260" style="s2">which is multiple males and multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.930" end="00:03:03.880" style="s2">females monogamy is the most common</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.260" end="00:03:05.739" style="s2">system on earth today polygyny would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.880" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">the second most common and historically</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.739" end="00:03:12.100" style="s2">probably the most common mild polygyny</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:13.750" style="s2">polyandry is exceedingly rare though</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.100" end="00:03:17.140" style="s2">there are circumstances where human</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.750" end="00:03:18.850" style="s2">beings end up in a polyandrous situation</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.140" end="00:03:21.310" style="s2">where a female will have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.850" end="00:03:23.950" style="s2">husbands interestingly those cases all</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.310" end="00:03:26.889" style="s2">seem to involve brothers marrying the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.950" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">same woman which reduces the cost to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.889" end="00:03:31.810" style="s2">those males genetically of having</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:34.810" style="s2">another male father children with their</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.810" end="00:03:38.609" style="s2">wife and then there&#39;s promiscuity which</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.810" end="00:03:43.450" style="s2">probably has been exceedingly rare in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.609" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">human history but is essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.450" end="00:03:47.350" style="s2">basis for what is now being called</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:49.600" style="s2">polyamory and people are experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.350" end="00:03:51.579" style="s2">with this mode whether that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.600" end="00:03:52.600" style="s2">is an interesting question but in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.579" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">certainly something people are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.600" end="00:03:57.090" style="s2">interested in at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:59.530" style="s2">each of these mating systems are</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.090" end="00:04:02.590" style="s2">evolutionary responses to particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.530" end="00:04:04.359" style="s2">kinds of conditions there are virtually</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.590" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">no conditions in particular -</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.359" end="00:04:09.989" style="s2">promiscuity makes sense and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:13.030" style="s2">for that is that human babies are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.989" end="00:04:15.850" style="s2">extremely needy and because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.030" end="00:04:18.250" style="s2">extremely needy females are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.850" end="00:04:20.829" style="s2">required to care for them apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.250" end="00:04:23.140" style="s2">see and nursing are both very labor</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.829" end="00:04:26.860" style="s2">intensive and so females are incapable</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.140" end="00:04:29.320" style="s2">of having a low investment relationship</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.860" end="00:04:30.690" style="s2">with offspring and that means that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.320" end="00:04:33.850" style="s2">have every reason to be exceedingly</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.690" end="00:04:35.170" style="s2">choosy about with whom they mate and one</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.850" end="00:04:37.420" style="s2">of the things that they are most choosy</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.170" end="00:04:39.070" style="s2">about is evidence that a male will stick</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.420" end="00:04:42.760" style="s2">around and invest in these very needy</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.070" end="00:04:45.910" style="s2">offspring so promiscuity is pretty rare</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.760" end="00:04:50.410" style="s2">for that reason polyandry is pretty rare</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.910" end="00:04:55.240" style="s2">because males are selected to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.410" end="00:04:57.880" style="s2">letting other males mate with their pair</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.240" end="00:05:00.730" style="s2">bonded females because the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.880" end="00:05:03.490" style="s2">costs of raising another man&#39;s offspring</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.730" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">is so high so doing so when the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.490" end="00:05:06.760" style="s2">male is a brother reduces that cost by</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">50%</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.760" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">still we only see it in circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:15.310" style="s2">where the habitat is so marginal that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:17.230" style="s2">two individuals have trouble producing</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.310" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">enough labor to raise children</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.230" end="00:05:21.310" style="s2">successfully and they need a third a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">third that does not increase the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.310" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">of babies produced so that would have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">be a male rather than a female monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.530" end="00:05:32.410" style="s2">I would argue evolves when you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:35.530" style="s2">nonzero some dynamics like a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.410" end="00:05:37.930" style="s2">continent or something that a population</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.530" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">is going to spread across and producing</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.930" end="00:05:42.370" style="s2">new individuals of the highest rate is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:43.900" style="s2">favored in order to capture that entire</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.370" end="00:05:45.910" style="s2">new territory</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.900" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">monogamy is advantageous because it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.910" end="00:05:53.350" style="s2">brings every adult into child-rearing</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:55.870" style="s2">and the limit on the number of babies</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.350" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">produced has a lot to do with the amount</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.870" end="00:06:01.590" style="s2">that is being invested in taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:04.570" style="s2">new offspring so raising them and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.590" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">getting them fed and then allowing</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.570" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">females to move on to their next</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:10.060" style="s2">offspring is prioritized in circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:12.729" style="s2">where there&#39;s new territory to fill with</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.060" end="00:06:13.930" style="s2">people and so it selects for monogamy so</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.729" end="00:06:17.979" style="s2">I would answer I would I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.930" end="00:06:21.669" style="s2">that the reason that human populations</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.979" end="00:06:23.950" style="s2">have shifted in recent millenia in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.669" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">direction of monogamy has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.950" end="00:06:30.530" style="s2">fact that it was also an age in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:34.680" style="s2">lots of land masses that were either</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.530" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">under-exploited or that were inhabited</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.680" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">by people who did not have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:41.910" style="s2">technology to defend them resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:45.080" style="s2">populations moving into those places and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.910" end="00:06:45.080" style="s2">spreading across them</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.129" end="00:06:52.929" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that this answer actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.080" end="00:06:55.899" style="s2">requires us to specify which version of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.929" end="00:06:58.869" style="s2">marriage we&#39;re talking about really the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.899" end="00:07:00.819" style="s2">point is you have a bond between two</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.249" end="00:07:11.769" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about monogamy because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.769" end="00:07:15.789" style="s2">the simplest case but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.279" end="00:07:24.849" style="s2">shocked that we never discussed the</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.860" end="00:07:32.349" style="s2">their siblings become your siblings in</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.709" end="00:07:41.349" style="s2">effectively a sibling relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.399" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">in fact marriage has a lot in common</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.349" end="00:07:46.539" style="s2">with a regular sibling relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:50.279" style="s2">marriage is in spite of the mythology</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.539" end="00:07:53.939" style="s2">that often surrounds them are extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.279" end="00:07:57.429" style="s2">complicated relationships and there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.939" end="00:07:59.019" style="s2">tension and there&#39;s a lot of richness to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.429" end="00:08:01.389" style="s2">them in much the same way that there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.019" end="00:08:04.749" style="s2">a sibling relationship and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.389" end="00:08:09.009" style="s2">for that is pretty obvious which is just</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.749" end="00:08:11.949" style="s2">like siblings spouses have real things</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.009" end="00:08:13.929" style="s2">at stake and their interests are not a</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.939" end="00:08:20.860" style="s2">divergence and so what that results in</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.769" end="00:08:24.339" style="s2">is real tension over things that matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.860" end="00:08:27.309" style="s2">and anybody who goes into marriage</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.339" end="00:08:29.379" style="s2">thinking that it&#39;s going to be like a</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.259" end="00:08:41.889" style="s2">functional marriage is supposed to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.610" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">like if they run into those tensions</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.889" end="00:08:47.019" style="s2">they often imagine that that is either</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:49.540" style="s2">the result of them failing to do it well</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.019" end="00:08:52.089" style="s2">or the result of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.540" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">entire idea of marriage is bogus to</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:36.170" style="s2">way to real love or it may not but that</p>

<p begin="00:12:33.860" end="00:12:39.710" style="s2">is that females have everything to lose</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.060" end="00:15:53.949" style="s2">allows the evolution of high degrees of</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.540" end="00:16:08.170" style="s2">universe keeps telling us that by</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.240" end="00:16:24.430" style="s2">that picks up most of what it is</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.970" end="00:16:34.959" style="s2">they carry around in their minds rather</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.829" end="00:16:36.819" style="s2">than their genomes and then they pass on</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.959" end="00:16:39.399" style="s2">to offspring in a way that can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.819" end="00:16:41.800" style="s2">augmented and modified for changes in</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.800" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">an amazingly powerful phenomenon and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.550" end="00:16:50.790" style="s2">is not in any way incidental human</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:52.810" style="s2">beings are all about the software</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.790" end="00:16:54.850" style="s2">monogamous pair bonds that raise</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.810" end="00:16:57.610" style="s2">offspring are all about transmitting</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2">the ideal way for that to work so there</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.490" end="00:17:10.600" style="s2">are many asymmetries between men and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:12.189" style="s2">women if we if we look at what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.600" end="00:17:14.169" style="s2">would have been like in ancestral</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.189" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">circumstances and I&#39;m an advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.169" end="00:17:19.089" style="s2">the idea that all of these things can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:21.069" style="s2">opened up and we can decide some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.089" end="00:17:23.020" style="s2">these asymmetries may not be desirable</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.069" end="00:17:24.699" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t want to perpetuate them</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.020" end="00:17:26.740" style="s2">into the future some of them may be</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.699" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">desirable but we want to democratize the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.740" end="00:17:29.660" style="s2">content so we may want to take stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">that&#39;s traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.660" end="00:17:35.900" style="s2">masculine and and make it available to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">everybody and likewise some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.900" end="00:17:40.970" style="s2">that&#39;s feminine we may want to make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.000" end="00:17:43.310" style="s2">available to everybody in general I</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.970" end="00:17:46.580" style="s2">would say that there is a dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.310" end="00:17:48.470" style="s2">between males and females under</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.580" end="00:17:51.170" style="s2">ancestral circumstances that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.470" end="00:17:53.840" style="s2">the fact that females are much lower</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.170" end="00:17:56.630" style="s2">variance than males with respect to how</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.840" end="00:18:01.460" style="s2">many offspring they can produce females</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.630" end="00:18:05.510" style="s2">are limited by the rate at which they</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.460" end="00:18:07.190" style="s2">can get pregnant nurse a child to wean</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.510" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">it and then get pregnant again and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.190" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">that puts a relatively low limit on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:14.510" style="s2">number of offspring that can be produced</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:16.910" style="s2">in a lifetime a man if he is having sex</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.510" end="00:18:18.620" style="s2">without commitment can produce an</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.910" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">indefinitely large number of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.620" end="00:18:25.100" style="s2">in a lifetime so that high variance</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:27.380" style="s2">versus low variance distinction has all</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.100" end="00:18:29.330" style="s2">kinds of implications for the way men</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.380" end="00:18:31.930" style="s2">and women have traditionally viewed the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.330" end="00:18:34.700" style="s2">world and I think it results in</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.930" end="00:18:37.190" style="s2">essentially two different toolkits of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.700" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">wisdom that have traveled through</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.190" end="00:18:41.720" style="s2">humanity&#39;s past one of them has</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:46.550" style="s2">travelled a female path that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.720" end="00:18:48.980" style="s2">kind of farsighted wisdom that comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.550" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2">closer to matching the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.980" end="00:18:53.350" style="s2">population at large because a female</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.050" end="00:18:57.320" style="s2">can&#39;t get lucky and produce a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.350" end="00:18:59.750" style="s2">offspring in a lifetime her Oscar</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.320" end="00:19:03.470" style="s2">Fitness is largely a matter of how well</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.470" end="00:19:08.350" style="s2">therefore how good a home it provides</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.290" end="00:19:12.500" style="s2">for whatever offspring she produces</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.350" end="00:19:15.190" style="s2">males because they&#39;re high variance are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.500" end="00:19:17.990" style="s2">much more likely to have wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.190" end="00:19:19.370" style="s2">high-risk high-reward activities and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.990" end="00:19:23.240" style="s2">we think about some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.370" end="00:19:26.000" style="s2">men are traditionally imagined to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.240" end="00:19:27.770" style="s2">involved in stuff like getting on a ship</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.000" end="00:19:30.620" style="s2">and going over the horizon to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.770" end="00:19:33.260" style="s2">over there that&#39;s a it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.620" end="00:19:34.790" style="s2">dangerous behavior and most of the men</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.260" end="00:19:37.070" style="s2">who did that probably didn&#39;t come back</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.070" end="00:19:42.170" style="s2">came back big winners and so that a</p>

<p begin="00:19:42.170" end="00:19:45.539" style="s2">likely to have tried</p>

<p begin="00:19:45.539" end="00:19:52.409" style="s2">that these kinds of wisdom can&#39;t be made</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.049" end="00:19:53.700" style="s2">general that a woman who wants to get</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.460" end="00:21:58.490" style="s2">would have been to invest in a female</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.430" end="00:22:00.710" style="s2">to pair-bond with them and to invest in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.490" end="00:22:05.390" style="s2">their offspring and that&#39;s a lower</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.390" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">the more common way of getting there</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.420" end="00:22:15.770" style="s2">in that phase looking for a mate in whom</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:18.710" style="s2">to invest for the long haul males</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.770" end="00:22:22.220" style="s2">females are much more similar a male</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.710" end="00:22:24.110" style="s2">who&#39;s looking for a wife is much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.220" end="00:22:28.760" style="s2">like a female looking for a husband than</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.110" end="00:22:31.130" style="s2">a male looking to score and so what this</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.760" end="00:22:34.040" style="s2">means is that males have these two</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.130" end="00:22:36.980" style="s2">phases and one of them is Randy and not</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.040" end="00:22:39.380" style="s2">very interesting and somehow this</p>

<p begin="00:22:45.710" end="00:22:50.390" style="s2">men they have to quote/unquote behave</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.960" end="00:22:52.520" style="s2">like men and to behave like men doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.390" end="00:22:53.780" style="s2">mean like behaving like men in their</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.780" end="00:22:58.340" style="s2">it means behaving like men in their most</p>

<p begin="00:22:58.340" end="00:23:06.280" style="s2">phase so what we&#39;re effectively doing is</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.280" end="00:23:12.740" style="s2">masculinity be democratized so women</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.740" end="00:23:20.780" style="s2">we have is stupid male behavior being</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.620" end="00:23:35.720" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about new rules for</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.860" end="00:23:38.990" style="s2">sexuality and which one constantly needs</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.720" end="00:23:41.930" style="s2">to seek you know the re-establishment of</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.929" end="00:24:17.220" style="s2">yeah aggro getting lucky stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.610" end="00:24:19.559" style="s2">destroy the high quality version of</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.220" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">masculinity and we put in its place a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.559" end="00:24:27.530" style="s2">low-quality version of masculinity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.020" end="00:24:30.179" style="s2">frankly the female analogue this</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.530" end="00:24:32.490" style="s2">masculinity that is Unleashed superhero</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.179" end="00:24:35.160" style="s2">female that you&#39;re talking about is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.490" end="00:24:41.429" style="s2">fiction alright it doesn&#39;t really work</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.160" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">and I would say the women who I know who</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.429" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">have these may be traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.630" style="s2">masculine characteristics who really</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:51.300" style="s2">pull it off who are really super capable</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.630" end="00:24:53.970" style="s2">and you know who you would want to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.300" end="00:24:57.630" style="s2">have on your team under under terrible</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.970" end="00:24:59.280" style="s2">circumstances it looks much more like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.630" end="00:25:03.179" style="s2">traditional masculinity than it does</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.280" end="00:25:06.890" style="s2">like some modern made-up version so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.179" end="00:25:13.350" style="s2">said there&#39;s the to evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.890" end="00:25:16.710" style="s2">strategies there&#39;s so ago yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.350" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">terrible way to put it but yes yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.710" end="00:25:22.740" style="s2">mean you know the thing is this exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.220" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">in the mythology - right men sow their</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.740" end="00:25:28.309" style="s2">Wild Oats and then they settle down now</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:32.250" style="s2">settling down makes it sound awful but</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.309" end="00:25:36.780" style="s2">really what they do is they they wise up</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.250" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">you know I had a mentor when I was in</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">graduate school very interesting guy</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.400" end="00:25:47.460" style="s2">very one-off kind of guy who had certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.140" end="00:25:51.240" style="s2">kinds of wisdom and he used to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.460" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">about the difference in men after their</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.240" end="00:25:54.990" style="s2">libido stop jerking him around and his</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:58.070" style="s2">basic point was it&#39;s very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.990" end="00:26:00.179" style="s2">concentrate when your libido you know is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.070" end="00:26:04.500" style="s2">pointing you this way in that way and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.179" end="00:26:06.809" style="s2">that when that lets you go suddenly you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.500" end="00:26:09.090" style="s2">have access to your full mental</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.809" end="00:26:11.040" style="s2">faculties to point at problems that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.090" end="00:26:12.100" style="s2">actually worthy of your attention you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.040" end="00:26:14.919" style="s2">still have a dry</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.100" end="00:26:16.539" style="s2">masculine force but now you get to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.919" end="00:26:19.090" style="s2">concentrate it on the building or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.539" end="00:26:19.630" style="s2">larger project or family or something</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.090" end="00:26:24.610" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.630" end="00:26:27.070" style="s2">totally yeah yeah I get to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.610" end="00:26:30.370" style="s2">to be a man I guess there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.070" end="00:26:35.950" style="s2">discussion in society about whether or</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.370" end="00:26:37.419" style="s2">not monogamy is a problem to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.950" end="00:26:40.030" style="s2">in other words if it is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.419" end="00:26:41.340" style="s2">puritanical instinct that is holding us</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.030" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">back from what we really are</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.340" end="00:26:47.260" style="s2">biologically this is nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:49.840" style="s2">monogamy is an evolved state and it has</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.260" end="00:26:53.470" style="s2">served the populations that most of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.840" end="00:26:57.159" style="s2">come from very well do we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.470" end="00:26:59.370" style="s2">maintain it I can&#39;t say for sure I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.159" end="00:27:05.140" style="s2">say that the alternative that people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.370" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">advancing polyamory is not likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.140" end="00:27:12.370" style="s2">stable and it is almost certainly going</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:15.669" style="s2">to devolve into polygyny that in a state</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.370" end="00:27:19.900" style="s2">where people are lowering the bar to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.669" end="00:27:22.150" style="s2">mating what ultimately happens is those</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.900" end="00:27:24.010" style="s2">people who are powerful those men who</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.150" end="00:27:27.340" style="s2">are powerful end up accumulating many</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.010" end="00:27:30.100" style="s2">mates and many men get frozen out by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.340" end="00:27:33.190" style="s2">fact that their lower status when that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.100" end="00:27:35.140" style="s2">happens you produce a situation that is</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.230" end="00:27:49.210" style="s2">males ultimately become armies somebody</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.590" end="00:27:51.070" style="s2">decides to arm them and point them at</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.070" end="00:27:56.980" style="s2">themselves or they become violent so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.340" end="00:28:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be said from society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.980" end="00:28:04.299" style="s2">perspective for monogamy being the state</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.520" end="00:28:06.309" style="s2">that is the best that is the most</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.299" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">compatible with the values that we all</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.370" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">of view it is also the most rewarding</p>
