<p begin="00:00:06.629" end="00:00:11.700" style="s2">episode with Chris so I wanted just to</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.660" end="00:00:14.460" style="s2">give a little prelude to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.700" end="00:00:18.359" style="s2">conversation because we started the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">conversation and we started recording</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.359" end="00:00:23.340" style="s2">even though it was kind of a personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">dialogue we were having so we had we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.340" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">been talking for a little bit over an</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:31.349" style="s2">hour I think by the time the part that</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:33.510" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna see is recorded so given</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.349" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">the nature of conversations I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.510" end="00:00:37.530" style="s2">if you&#39;ve noticed but you know real</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">conversation is gonna have like a their</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.530" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">own character to them so you have their</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:48.559" style="s2">own horizons and so it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">to start a enter a conversation Midway</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.559" end="00:00:53.820" style="s2">without understanding the horizons</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">that&#39;s calling forth the speech so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.820" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">you know it&#39;s all temporally one-one</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:01.940" style="s2">character so I just wanted to give a</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:04.140" style="s2">little prelude to to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.940" end="00:01:09.540" style="s2">essentially what we had been talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.140" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">about was meeting significance how one</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.540" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">finds one&#39;s ground and and you could say</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">a test to and aligns themselves one with</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:26.130" style="s2">one&#39;s ultimate concerns and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">when the concerns of your life that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.130" end="00:01:30.060" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have the direct</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">connection in addressing those ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.060" end="00:01:37.229" style="s2">concerns yet you are bonded to them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:39.960" style="s2">what it&#39;s like to live in that tension</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.229" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">and going through the transitions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:44.210" style="s2">making that alignment and everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">that that one goes through with that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.210" end="00:01:50.460" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of one horizon in which we</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">were speaking which which naturally</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:57.090" style="s2">progressed to the nature of our lives is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">being kind of a conversation or a kind</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:30.870" style="s2">of finding out together what this is but</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">one of the things that in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.870" end="00:02:37.709" style="s2">last couple of dialogue losses with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">four of us I&#39;ll put links underneath to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.709" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">those conversations is this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">the world as being about and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">ways to respond to the meaning crisis or</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:03:04.469" style="s2">as as a way to address nihilism is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:03:07.739" style="s2">the restoration of the world as thou yep</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.469" end="00:03:11.879" style="s2">at the same time not personifying the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.739" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">world in making the world a person than</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.879" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">that then nouns but what is it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:21.209" style="s2">experience the world as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:25.049" style="s2">vulnerability to meet it with all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.209" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">ways that one greets allow the eye that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.049" end="00:03:31.109" style="s2">arouses what thou what kind of eye would</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.109" end="00:03:38.090" style="s2">is it now so we continue on with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">conversation through talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.090" end="00:03:43.019" style="s2">dialogue and the conversations we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">been having in the personal impact that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.019" end="00:03:47.970" style="s2">those conversations have been having on</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:49.829" style="s2">us personally and a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.970" end="00:03:53.129" style="s2">what it is and where we see it headache</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.829" end="00:03:55.859" style="s2">and so so I just wanted to get some some</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.129" end="00:03:58.259" style="s2">of the some of the things that we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.859" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">addressing leading up to this point that</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.259" end="00:04:06.829" style="s2">you begin to watch okay I hope that bill</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:06.829" style="s2">is you in enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.770" end="00:04:15.550" style="s2">this is this is how we integrate the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.010" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">deeper structures of understanding into</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.550" end="00:04:19.930" style="s2">our lives right is through conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:23.670" style="s2">so kind of like this as simple as just</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.930" end="00:04:30.220" style="s2">like huh buddy you know somebody has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.670" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">has a you know goes has some experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.220" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">it goes outside of the box right like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:36.100" style="s2">you know something this is like a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:37.480" style="s2">carnival ride or something where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.100" end="00:04:39.400" style="s2">like yeah they get off and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.480" end="00:04:42.310" style="s2">holy I&#39;ve never been flipped upside</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.400" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">down and they they&#39;re moved to talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.310" end="00:04:46.510" style="s2">about it and talk you know and like what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">are they doing when they&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.510" end="00:04:52.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like well they have an experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:58.600" style="s2">that their normal conceptual frames</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.200" end="00:05:00.100" style="s2">can&#39;t can&#39;t conceive of right they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.600" end="00:05:03.160" style="s2">an experience and there&#39;s this tension</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.100" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">so they&#39;re moved to talk right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.160" end="00:05:10.300" style="s2">moved into that well it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:14.530" style="s2">when you think about like that same</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.300" end="00:05:16.180" style="s2">process being both one the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.530" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">experience that you would integrate</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.180" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">right where it&#39;s like like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">conversation can erupt something right</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.160" style="s2">such that you&#39;re like oh my god you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">want to talk about it but it&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.160" end="00:05:34.530" style="s2">thing that&#39;s doing the integrating at</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:38.530" style="s2">the same time there&#39;s something great so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.530" end="00:05:41.650" style="s2">the feedback loop is so this is why I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.530" end="00:05:42.910" style="s2">think this is why but this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.650" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">why I&#39;m listening one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.910" end="00:05:49.180" style="s2">just kind of listening to in what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:51.900" style="s2">doing is people&#39;s responses to it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.180" end="00:05:54.729" style="s2">yeah I noticed that too it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.900" end="00:05:56.440" style="s2">experiential like and especially my</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.729" end="00:05:58.780" style="s2">understanding with you to sound like</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.440" end="00:06:00.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve necessarily read done a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.780" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">a lot of the comments and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.610" end="00:06:06.100" style="s2">that but like YouTube is not known for</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.740" end="00:06:07.960" style="s2">their for into warm comments right no it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.100" end="00:06:10.270" style="s2">is not not at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:13.030" style="s2">and people are kind of having an</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.270" end="00:06:15.910" style="s2">experience and feeling grateful and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.030" end="00:06:18.220" style="s2">you can tell it they&#39;re writing out of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.910" end="00:06:21.029" style="s2">sense of like they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.220" end="00:06:23.909" style="s2">conversation right yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.029" end="00:06:29.879" style="s2">and that&#39;s and that all of that is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.909" end="00:06:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really work we&#39;re at the print</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.879" end="00:06:33.059" style="s2">I feel like we&#39;re at the precipice of</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.679" end="00:06:38.149" style="s2">some bit something that I don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.059" end="00:06:41.519" style="s2">totally understand but I&#39;m imagining</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.149" end="00:06:44.639" style="s2">that there&#39;s something akin to what I</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.519" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">would I my pictures of what the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:52.949" style="s2">Academy was like yes right yes but</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of distributed it right</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.949" end="00:06:59.339" style="s2">that actually some part of it holds old</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:01.259" style="s2">through one because it&#39;s not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.339" end="00:07:04.189" style="s2">although the technology allows for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.259" end="00:07:06.989" style="s2">district distribute like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.189" end="00:07:09.779" style="s2">distribution of it right you should of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.989" end="00:07:12.589" style="s2">it mm-hmm the you actually have to take</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.779" end="00:07:15.209" style="s2">time and listen to it right yes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.589" end="00:07:17.279" style="s2">experience it and be in the midst of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.209" end="00:07:20.189" style="s2">and you have a way of responding to it</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.149" end="00:07:58.309" style="s2">coming together going a guy wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.079" end="00:08:00.599" style="s2">map out what we talked about and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.309" end="00:08:02.459" style="s2">and he got halfway through and he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.599" end="00:08:04.919" style="s2">god I can&#39;t map all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.459" end="00:08:06.899" style="s2">out but there&#39;s got to be a way this</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.919" end="00:08:10.289" style="s2">whole other conversation of these coders</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.899" end="00:08:13.709" style="s2">coming together and oh that&#39;s cool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.289" end="00:08:15.119" style="s2">really cool talking and I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.709" end="00:08:18.449" style="s2">know what they&#39;re talking about it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.119" end="00:08:19.789" style="s2">just as I was like I asked him like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.449" end="00:08:22.619" style="s2">think I asked him was it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.789" end="00:08:26.879" style="s2">that is there a way that AI</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.619" end="00:08:28.379" style="s2">can actually kind of identify the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.879" end="00:08:30.029" style="s2">different threads and put them in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.379" end="00:08:31.499" style="s2">category such that we could get done and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.029" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">we can actually have it in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.499" end="00:08:34.470" style="s2">right can it do that right I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.470" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">Jordan was talking about that with John</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:39.270" style="s2">one died I think that that that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2">think that&#39;s something maybe Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.270" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">been thinking about that&#39;s less I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:46.500" style="s2">within his linking the different</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">conversations and watching a way of just</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.500" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">measuring the themes that create a kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:55.970" style="s2">of metacognitive something I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:59.310" style="s2">and then to understand what yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.970" end="00:09:01.560" style="s2">yeah so what would be revealed to us if</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.310" end="00:09:04.530" style="s2">we if we were to if we were to see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.560" end="00:09:06.780" style="s2">Ray if we were to see the typography of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.530" end="00:09:08.280" style="s2">what was mapped by the discussions yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.780" end="00:09:10.220" style="s2">way in which we&#39;re not we can&#39;t be fully</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.280" end="00:09:13.110" style="s2">aware of it because it&#39;s just occurring</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.220" end="00:09:14.370" style="s2">until it&#39;s intelligibility patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.110" end="00:09:16.470" style="s2">intelligibility that are occurring</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.370" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">through us that we can&#39;t really map and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.470" end="00:09:20.430" style="s2">organize and so but were to be organized</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">God I just wonder like what ended up</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.430" end="00:09:24.780" style="s2">would we learn as a consequence and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:28.770" style="s2">bring that up and then we take that into</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.780" end="00:09:30.630" style="s2">dialogue right right this you know of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.770" end="00:09:32.970" style="s2">all these different conversations and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.630" end="00:09:35.430" style="s2">can kind I mean it just exists fast</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.970" end="00:09:37.980" style="s2">Wow see this one&#39;s a cool one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.430" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">things it seems missing to me about you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.980" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">know the pathology of it you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:46.140" style="s2">especially with Twitter apparently</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">because it&#39;s you can only use 42 words</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.140" end="00:09:51.840" style="s2">or something yeah yeah exactly a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:54.600" style="s2">character limitation and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:09:57.150" style="s2">turned into like it can just go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.600" end="00:09:59.280" style="s2">most of it right yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.150" end="00:10:02.010" style="s2">designed to be to be to be pithy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.280" end="00:10:05.610" style="s2">insubstantial yeah basically designed to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.010" end="00:10:09.690" style="s2">be to be to to reject like long-form</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.610" end="00:10:12.060" style="s2">complexity totally yeah and so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.690" end="00:10:14.490" style="s2">it just seems like what we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.060" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">is the first area the first time in like</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.490" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">the first time the world has gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:23.070" style="s2">have one unified default network just</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:25.160" style="s2">doing what you know everyone&#39;s default</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.070" end="00:10:29.370" style="s2">network does which is like blame and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.160" end="00:10:31.740" style="s2">status things and yeah yeah if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.370" end="00:10:36.150" style="s2">way to like if there&#39;s a way for somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.740" end="00:10:39.990" style="s2">this can be can actually can go lateral</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.150" end="00:10:42.390" style="s2">and then something substantial the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.990" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">substantial thing gets to be gradual and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.390" end="00:10:47.130" style="s2">then it goes lateral again and converse</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:47.949" style="s2">and you just keep going like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.130" end="00:10:50.139" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.949" end="00:10:56.679" style="s2">who the knows what that is like</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.139" end="00:10:59.679" style="s2">yeah who knows but yeah truly yeah Wow</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.679" end="00:11:03.309" style="s2">but I think though that people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.679" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">really bright people are looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.309" end="00:11:09.399" style="s2">lot of this and going this like like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:11.799" style="s2">whatever that is that that recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.399" end="00:11:13.419" style="s2">something I&#39;m just kind of going like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.799" end="00:11:15.100" style="s2">what are they it right you remind me a</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.419" end="00:11:17.949" style="s2">little bit of like circling right like</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.100" end="00:11:20.589" style="s2">of like what the hell is this like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.949" end="00:11:21.850" style="s2">the hell&#39;s going on and why I really</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.589" end="00:11:23.169" style="s2">appreciate the thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.850" end="00:11:28.509" style="s2">about too because having these</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.169" end="00:11:31.480" style="s2">conversations you know because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.509" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">have any of the background of academia</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:37.779" style="s2">right so and one of the things that John</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:39.399" style="s2">said in a in a one of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.779" end="00:11:43.149" style="s2">he&#39;s like you know you got he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.399" end="00:11:47.259" style="s2">what like you you he said you and me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.149" end="00:11:49.119" style="s2">Jordan don&#39;t have the same burden as I</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.259" end="00:11:52.269" style="s2">have right like the like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.119" end="00:11:55.029" style="s2">burden or demand right and he was</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.269" end="00:11:56.410" style="s2">talking about like having the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.029" end="00:11:57.850" style="s2">and those are those kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.410" end="00:11:59.799" style="s2">there&#39;s like yeah and I really</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.850" end="00:12:02.649" style="s2">appreciated what he was saying like it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.799" end="00:12:06.069" style="s2">was like you&#39;re right I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.649" end="00:12:08.499" style="s2">demands of specificity and all those</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.069" end="00:12:11.919" style="s2">kinds of things so it seems to afford a</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.499" end="00:12:14.589" style="s2">lot more a different it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.919" end="00:12:19.329" style="s2">set of constraints right right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.589" end="00:12:20.889" style="s2">right however for me having people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.329" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">talk to you like this I&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.889" end="00:12:28.569" style="s2">had at this level in fact in fact a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:31.119" style="s2">of times this is like you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.569" end="00:12:35.199" style="s2">this all of this grappling and all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.119" end="00:12:36.879" style="s2">like a reading the philosophy eight</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.199" end="00:12:39.009" style="s2">hours a day or whatever the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.879" end="00:12:41.110" style="s2">doing like I&#39;ve never had anyone really</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.009" end="00:12:44.499" style="s2">to talk to it and about it at this level</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.110" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">I&#39;ve had some friends that like have</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.499" end="00:12:48.189" style="s2">have met me a few times and it&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.600" end="00:12:50.439" style="s2">exact like it was always exhilarating</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.189" end="00:12:55.539" style="s2">but they kind of had their own their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.439" end="00:12:57.459" style="s2">directions and things so so I learned it</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.539" end="00:12:59.079" style="s2">would source source a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.459" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">that was happening and I would bring it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.079" end="00:13:04.420" style="s2">bring the understanding into what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:06.760" style="s2">was doing but I I mean I learned pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.420" end="00:13:09.149" style="s2">quickly that like if I go too far into</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.760" end="00:13:12.459" style="s2">the grappling people just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.149" end="00:13:14.019" style="s2">what all you there yeah course what ends</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.459" end="00:13:15.250" style="s2">up happening as you said people go like</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.019" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">you should stop reading all those books</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.250" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">like why you just in your head like and</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:27.790" style="s2">so it&#39;s been so gratifying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:30.279" style="s2">have people that have read more than I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.790" end="00:13:32.500" style="s2">have and all like have all of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.279" end="00:13:35.399" style="s2">different and to go into conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.500" end="00:13:42.149" style="s2">with them and and have this experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.399" end="00:13:44.920" style="s2">at this level that kind of ecstatic deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.149" end="00:13:49.480" style="s2">evocative experience at this level is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.920" end="00:13:51.699" style="s2">just I I&#39;m watching it open things up</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.480" end="00:13:54.730" style="s2">for me and possibility is that I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.699" end="00:13:56.649" style="s2">wow this is this feels like this this</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.730" end="00:13:59.320" style="s2">could be a whole new level of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.649" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what exactly what yet yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.320" end="00:14:04.839" style="s2">I feel that too I feel that for myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:08.199" style="s2">as well I feel that for myself as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.839" end="00:14:14.829" style="s2">and I think that it&#39;s interesting what</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.199" end="00:14:18.579" style="s2">you say about about your like that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.829" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">simply because of your background you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.579" end="00:14:22.389" style="s2">don&#39;t have the same perhaps the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.850" style="s2">stakes are a bit different or that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.389" end="00:14:26.589" style="s2">don&#39;t have the same kinds dude demands</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.850" end="00:14:30.069" style="s2">but not the same kind of demands to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.589" end="00:14:33.069" style="s2">formulate arguments as for instance John</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.069" end="00:14:36.310" style="s2">does but see that the thing that I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.069" end="00:14:38.589" style="s2">that that&#39;s an incredible gift as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.310" end="00:14:42.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s a gift that you contribute into</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.589" end="00:14:45.610" style="s2">the conversations that that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.519" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">now I think is indispensable to them</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.610" end="00:14:52.149" style="s2">because I think that honestly because</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">before you came into the conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.149" end="00:14:58.120" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve seen John have discourses with</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:59.740" style="s2">people for like four years before before</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.120" end="00:15:04.019" style="s2">they started happening and they got like</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.740" end="00:15:06.430" style="s2">online like this and they were always</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.019" end="00:15:09.880" style="s2">relative I mean some of them were were</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.430" end="00:15:11.800" style="s2">wonderfully ecstatic and and brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.880" end="00:15:15.250" style="s2">and upbuilding but they were still</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.800" end="00:15:18.010" style="s2">always about they</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.250" end="00:15:24.190" style="s2">still always about the leveraging of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.010" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">arguments and and and you&#39;re like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.190" end="00:15:31.720" style="s2">sort of the element of reflexivity mmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:36.570" style="s2">personal reflexivity that you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.720" end="00:15:39.360" style="s2">brought now into in the discourse I</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.570" end="00:15:43.300" style="s2">think what you&#39;ve done is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.360" end="00:15:46.960" style="s2">characterized the argumentative process</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.300" end="00:15:49.900" style="s2">in a way that is precisely analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.960" end="00:15:51.820" style="s2">the Socratic or platonic Academy because</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.900" end="00:15:56.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.820" end="00:15:59.950" style="s2">reason that arguments or propositions in</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.470" end="00:16:02.290" style="s2">the Platonic dialogues are characterized</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.950" end="00:16:05.140" style="s2">they are fleshed into perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.290" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">vessels that are the characters yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.140" end="00:16:12.220" style="s2">so they fold in that kind of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:17.610" style="s2">ization with the proposition and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.220" end="00:16:20.260" style="s2">way when you undermine or trade out a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.610" end="00:16:22.990" style="s2">proposition what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.260" end="00:16:27.640" style="s2">treating out an entire characterized</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.990" end="00:16:30.640" style="s2">perspective yeah and and and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.640" end="00:16:33.880" style="s2">it&#39;s an exercise in and by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.640" end="00:16:36.250" style="s2">the book that you sent me I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.880" end="00:16:38.110" style="s2">it&#39;s I&#39;m not finished yet but oh it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.250" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">good cuz yeah that&#39;s that he gets that</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.110" end="00:16:42.430" style="s2">so well that it&#39;s about it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:44.860" style="s2">training and it&#39;s that ineffable</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.430" end="00:16:47.620" style="s2">training of virtue and wisdom that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.860" end="00:16:50.350" style="s2">about how we characterize the process of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.620" end="00:16:53.230" style="s2">argumentation and I think the character</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.350" end="00:16:55.990" style="s2">part yeah that is something that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.230" end="00:16:59.740" style="s2">only been like that you&#39;ve brought that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.990" end="00:17:04.180" style="s2">in and that has changed things</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.740" end="00:17:06.850" style="s2">utterly utterly truly because now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.180" end="00:17:11.410" style="s2">like suddenly we&#39;re now thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.850" end="00:17:16.180" style="s2">knowing one another in dimensions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.410" end="00:17:19.000" style="s2">are now repossessing yeah the dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.180" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">of the arguments themselves a right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.000" end="00:17:23.319" style="s2">so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:26.260" style="s2">they&#39;re so it would it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.319" end="00:17:27.929" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s folding out the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.260" end="00:17:30.899" style="s2">space of each proposition</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.929" end="00:17:33.480" style="s2">argument and in and living within it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.899" end="00:17:37.350" style="s2">you can only live within it if each one</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.480" end="00:17:39.450" style="s2">is somehow characterized right right and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.350" end="00:17:40.619" style="s2">the character of the argument I feel</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.450" end="00:17:44.490" style="s2">like is something like when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.619" end="00:17:47.669" style="s2">introduced some of the some of the some</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.490" end="00:17:51.389" style="s2">of the circling techniques into these</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.669" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">discourses yeah you gave them that like</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.389" end="00:17:56.639" style="s2">that reflex of knowing that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:58.379" style="s2">characterize the thinking and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.639" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">recharacterize ourselves with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.379" end="00:18:03.179" style="s2">thinking interesting so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">like and it&#39;s it&#39;s just so cool and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.179" end="00:18:08.460" style="s2">could have never entered like but but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:11.490" style="s2">think not being like a classical</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.460" end="00:18:13.950" style="s2">academic yeah has allowed you to do that</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.490" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">yeah as a classical academic cannot do</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.950" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">that yeah they just you&#39;re not trained</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:19.619" style="s2">to train not to do that oh because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:23.909" style="s2">feel like I feel like what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.619" end="00:18:27.029" style="s2">under your like deft hand is something</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.909" end="00:18:29.210" style="s2">like a reverse of an ad hominem right</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.029" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s ad hominem because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.210" end="00:18:35.369" style="s2">related to the way that the person</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:38.340" style="s2">figures and disposes the argument except</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.369" end="00:18:40.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not being used to which is usually</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.340" end="00:18:44.100" style="s2">it&#39;s ad hominem is used to discredit and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.980" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">disconfirm arguments by disconfirming or</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.100" end="00:18:49.889" style="s2">disk informing the person hmm right by</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:51.509" style="s2">saying the person is out of conformity</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.889" end="00:18:52.950" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like a plutonic cat it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.509" end="00:18:55.529" style="s2">kind of like a platonic slander if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.950" end="00:18:57.539" style="s2">think about it because the person is out</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.529" end="00:18:59.460" style="s2">of conformity with the enactment of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.539" end="00:19:01.710" style="s2">AI das that must mean that their</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.460" end="00:19:03.720" style="s2">proposition is undermined by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.710" end="00:19:05.879" style="s2">the fact that they are disconfirmed with</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:08.279" style="s2">the truth thus their proposition must</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.879" end="00:19:09.629" style="s2">also be dis conformed with the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.279" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">I think that what you&#39;re doing is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.629" end="00:19:16.519" style="s2">taking the ad hominem yeah taking taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:20.879" style="s2">whatever instinct leads us to ad hominem</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.519" end="00:19:23.369" style="s2">but giving it a valence of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.879" end="00:19:25.409" style="s2">like turning it in the SPAC into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.369" end="00:19:27.929" style="s2">service of knowing yeah it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.409" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">we&#39;re always tempted to characterize one</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.929" end="00:19:33.980" style="s2">another and to characterize thinking not</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:36.659" style="s2">to render it dispassionate and-and-and</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.980" end="00:19:38.909" style="s2">calculative okay so if we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.659" end="00:19:41.190" style="s2">tempted to do that but we&#39;re also always</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.909" end="00:19:41.950" style="s2">wary of the ad hominem because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.190" end="00:19:44.140" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.950" end="00:19:47.920" style="s2">a refuge of scoundrels and the throws of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.140" end="00:19:51.220" style="s2">argument how can we take the how can we</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.920" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">take the the instincts to ad hominem and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.220" end="00:19:55.750" style="s2">actually use it to repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:19:58.030" style="s2">conversation into a more embodied form</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.750" end="00:19:59.590" style="s2">of knowing and I feel like I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.030" end="00:20:02.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;ve injected into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.590" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">discourse mom it&#39;s like a a uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.740" end="00:20:07.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like dignifying the ad hominem</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:11.080" style="s2">impulse when I folding it back into</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.810" end="00:20:12.160" style="s2">philosophy ax I&#39;m interesting so I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.080" end="00:20:14.770" style="s2">to make sure I&#39;m getting what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.160" end="00:20:20.350" style="s2">by the characterizing so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.770" end="00:20:27.490" style="s2">something like is that is that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.350" end="00:20:31.300" style="s2">like we&#39;re talking about an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.490" end="00:20:32.950" style="s2">then maybe I like I get it and I say is</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.300" end="00:20:34.780" style="s2">this kind of what we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.950" end="00:20:38.260" style="s2">over here and then bringing in another</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.780" end="00:20:40.630" style="s2">context into it and impregnating it and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.260" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">yes into the center then taking it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.630" end="00:20:46.540" style="s2">walking around with it and like taking</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">it on and then enacting it in another</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.540" end="00:20:52.030" style="s2">understanding is that what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:53.890" style="s2">characterizing yes III yes I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.030" end="00:20:56.470" style="s2">that&#39;s you taking I think that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.890" end="00:20:58.870" style="s2">noticing the character of something okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.470" end="00:21:01.180" style="s2">and continuing to take like the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.870" end="00:21:03.400" style="s2">character is there what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.180" end="00:21:06.580" style="s2">you&#39;re pronouncing the character of an</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.400" end="00:21:09.700" style="s2">idea and then allowing the character to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.580" end="00:21:11.650" style="s2">articulate by giving the idea it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.700" end="00:21:15.070" style="s2">peripatetic like giving it its walk</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.650" end="00:21:16.720" style="s2">around walk around that&#39;s yes because</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.070" end="00:21:18.220" style="s2">like one thing you often do is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:20.830" style="s2">we&#39;ll be talking you&#39;re saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.220" end="00:21:23.530" style="s2">you just said it&#39;s like this is like Mia</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.830" end="00:21:25.450" style="s2">as though I were you you&#39;ll say you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.530" end="00:21:28.030" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.450" end="00:21:31.570" style="s2">saying like what I felt when I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.030" end="00:21:32.980" style="s2">hearing you saying acts yeah like what</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.570" end="00:21:36.370" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is like you&#39;re picking up a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.980" end="00:21:38.770" style="s2">tonus within a particular proposition or</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.370" end="00:21:41.050" style="s2">a particular idea so now and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.770" end="00:21:42.640" style="s2">calling our attention to it but when our</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.050" end="00:21:44.530" style="s2">attention is called to it we realize</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.640" end="00:21:47.170" style="s2">that there is a character to what is</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.530" end="00:21:49.300" style="s2">said there&#39;s in which it has its own</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.170" end="00:21:52.210" style="s2">feeling it has its own constitution</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.300" end="00:21:54.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a complexion to the idea and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.210" end="00:21:55.630" style="s2">then by taking that complexion to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.670" end="00:21:57.490" style="s2">idea you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.630" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">let&#39;s take that like let&#39;s not just take</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.490" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">the idea for its propositional content</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:03.880" style="s2">let&#39;s take the idea for its complexion</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:06.700" style="s2">and what it seems to be referring to its</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.880" end="00:22:09.040" style="s2">arch of its back that the movement of</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.040" end="00:22:15.010" style="s2">walk so that it can stretch out and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:17.020" style="s2">venture to wherever the idea naturally</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.010" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">wants to venture it&#39;s so like your</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:26.650" style="s2">giving it agency to guide our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">into a direction that otherwise how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.650" end="00:22:30.520" style="s2">we only been paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:34.660" style="s2">semantic content we wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.520" end="00:22:36.340" style="s2">able to notice wow that&#39;s it I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.660" end="00:22:39.150" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even know there was a word for</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.340" end="00:22:43.570" style="s2">that that&#39;s interesting that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.150" end="00:22:46.410" style="s2">that really describes it like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.570" end="00:22:49.770" style="s2">real that really does describe it</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.410" end="00:22:55.620" style="s2">because I think that that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.770" end="00:22:57.580" style="s2">learned to read hmm oh that&#39;s cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.620" end="00:23:01.060" style="s2">please see more about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:23:03.130" style="s2">well it&#39;s just it&#39;s so so if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.060" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">read if I had to actually read you had</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.130" end="00:23:09.640" style="s2">just my dyslexia and my my reading</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:11.980" style="s2">comprehension hasn&#39;t it like in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.640" end="00:23:13.570" style="s2">that where you can test me and like I</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.980" end="00:23:18.850" style="s2">have to fill in the blank answers and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.570" end="00:23:20.890" style="s2">stuff like that true actually like</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.850" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">multiple-choice answers are a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.890" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">and I think that then because I can kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2">of like feel which one&#39;s more correct oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:32.800" style="s2">right like I could just feel it like</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:35.080" style="s2">somehow but but if you ask me fill in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.800" end="00:23:37.690" style="s2">the blank like you know who said this</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.080" end="00:23:42.190" style="s2">one I can&#39;t remember anyone&#39;s names so</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.690" end="00:23:44.770" style="s2">specificity what it wait to know whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.190" end="00:23:47.460" style="s2">or not a proposition what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.770" end="00:23:49.810" style="s2">about is akin to the proposition or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.460" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">well even that actually if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.810" end="00:23:54.460" style="s2">feeling element to it but well so what</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:57.250" style="s2">would happen is like I I went to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.460" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">school system I went through I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.250" end="00:24:02.890" style="s2">know two or three years they took me out</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">of regular mainstream schools and I went</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.890" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">to two to three different like special</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:08.460" style="s2">ed schools um</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.580" end="00:24:13.950" style="s2">and ice by the time I got was</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:16.350" style="s2">mainstreamed back in into the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.950" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">grade I was still at like a 1st grade</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.350" end="00:24:22.260" style="s2">reading level and then a woman named</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:24.269" style="s2">Miss Bruch&#39;s just came into my school</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.260" end="00:24:28.019" style="s2">one day and she actually it turned out</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.269" end="00:24:30.390" style="s2">that she was my my uncle Ted&#39;s who&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.019" end="00:24:34.950" style="s2">older than the Me&#39;s and I think he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.390" end="00:24:36.870" style="s2">his 70s in the mid 70s now but um was</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.950" end="00:24:41.059" style="s2">his his grade school teacher all the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.870" end="00:24:43.620" style="s2">through oh wow years later but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.059" end="00:24:48.059" style="s2">hugest take me for a couple hours every</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.620" end="00:24:51.510" style="s2">day and then she somehow taught me how</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.059" end="00:24:54.570" style="s2">to read without me knowing it like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.510" end="00:24:56.190" style="s2">didn&#39;t know it I didn&#39;t know I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.570" end="00:24:58.649" style="s2">learning how to read because he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.190" end="00:25:01.409" style="s2">it didn&#39;t dawn on me cuz I and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.649" end="00:25:04.260" style="s2">know precisely what she did but I have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.409" end="00:25:07.289" style="s2">feeling what she did is she kind of she</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.260" end="00:25:10.889" style="s2">was able to observe just how I orient</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.289" end="00:25:13.710" style="s2">and she somehow took that orientation</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.889" end="00:25:15.269" style="s2">and then got me to read like that oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.269" end="00:25:21.149" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t understand that until years</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">later like well or when I first got this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.149" end="00:25:28.769" style="s2">was when I started to teach because when</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:32.190" style="s2">I started teaching training people on</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.769" end="00:25:33.720" style="s2">how to how to lead circles I&#39;m like okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.190" end="00:25:35.429" style="s2">good I can finally give these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.720" end="00:25:36.840" style="s2">these books that have just changed my</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.429" end="00:25:39.690" style="s2">life and I have that experience with</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.840" end="00:25:42.419" style="s2">books like I read a book and like like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.690" end="00:25:46.289" style="s2">some way I can almost define my life by</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.419" end="00:25:48.210" style="s2">the people when I was into that person</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.289" end="00:25:52.769" style="s2">at that time right I can almost think</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.210" end="00:25:54.510" style="s2">about my life almost like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.769" end="00:25:56.460" style="s2">when I was into toku that&#39;s when I got</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.510" end="00:25:58.830" style="s2">into like cool wind that&#39;s when I just</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.460" end="00:26:00.809" style="s2">that was that period I can think it like</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.830" end="00:26:04.350" style="s2">they have their care like times have</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.809" end="00:26:06.750" style="s2">their character yes yes who I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.350" end="00:26:10.409" style="s2">reading is really interesting s so</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.750" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">that&#39;s read a book and it just changes</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.409" end="00:26:15.240" style="s2">the way I see and understand things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:17.639" style="s2">talk and everything and so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.240" end="00:26:19.230" style="s2">like of course I thought that if I gave</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.639" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">my students this book that they would</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.230" end="00:26:22.360" style="s2">have that same experience and I remember</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:26.740" style="s2">I gave</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.360" end="00:26:30.980" style="s2">is it author birthing Tulku who is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.740" end="00:26:32.900" style="s2">familiar with Tokyo no so he said he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.980" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">Tibetan lama he started Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.900" end="00:26:41.990" style="s2">publishing and he just one day he just</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:45.320" style="s2">came up with this notion of going on</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.990" end="00:26:47.150" style="s2">this very Socratic inquiry into the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.320" end="00:26:50.870" style="s2">nature of time-space and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.150" end="00:26:53.270" style="s2">during western-style thing and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.870" end="00:26:54.890" style="s2">created this whole body of work I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.270" end="00:26:55.330" style="s2">know how he had time to do any of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.890" end="00:26:58.130" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:55.330" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s called peat the time-space</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.130" end="00:27:01.550" style="s2">knowledge vision he wrote all these</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">books and these books are basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.550" end="00:27:06.860" style="s2">taking all of the presumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:09.590" style="s2">time-space and knowledge and then taking</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.860" end="00:27:12.290" style="s2">its logic out and then questioning it</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.590" end="00:27:13.790" style="s2">and watching it all fall apart and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.290" end="00:27:16.310" style="s2">seeing what emerges and then he would</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.790" end="00:27:18.530" style="s2">have you go into like he would at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.310" end="00:27:20.600" style="s2">end of every chapter he he&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.530" end="00:27:24.260" style="s2">experiential exercises on how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.600" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">practice what you just read so was this</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.260" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">and and reading that was also at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">same time that I started reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:34.610" style="s2">Heidegger and they were very they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:37.790" style="s2">very wedded in ways that I can go god</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.610" end="00:27:40.580" style="s2">yeah they must be oh wow and so and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.790" end="00:27:41.780" style="s2">that&#39;s when I was that&#39;s how I I was</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.580" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">reading all that while I was learning</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.780" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">how to circle and it was to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.470" end="00:27:51.140" style="s2">movements right that I didn&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.170" end="00:27:52.970" style="s2">but so I gave them like time space and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.140" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">knowledge this big thick book and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.970" end="00:27:57.770" style="s2">like I can&#39;t wait until the next week</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:28:01.940" style="s2">that let&#39;s talk about it and they come</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.770" end="00:28:04.870" style="s2">back in and they&#39;re like what are you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.940" end="00:28:07.070" style="s2">us like how dare you what are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.870" end="00:28:09.650" style="s2">talking to do a circling and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.070" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">like I didn&#39;t quite know what to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.650" end="00:28:13.850" style="s2">like obvious and I realized I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:17.240" style="s2">know how it you think do a circling</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.850" end="00:28:27.950" style="s2">exactly I&#39;m like like don&#39;t you see and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.240" end="00:28:32.150" style="s2">then you know like that oh I actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.950" end="00:28:33.650" style="s2">may be I maybe don&#39;t I don&#39;t read the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.150" end="00:28:35.690" style="s2">same way maybe there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">there&#39;s something else going on</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.690" end="00:28:41.380" style="s2">and I think what ended up happening is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:45.260" style="s2">that is that I don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.380" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">demand I think to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.260" end="00:28:51.470" style="s2">particular of words so I could tolerate</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:54.050" style="s2">a lot of things being vague in a right</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.470" end="00:28:58.670" style="s2">sense right right right right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.050" end="00:29:00.590" style="s2">expect to I don&#39;t have a big criteria of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.670" end="00:29:04.220" style="s2">needing to understand that word like my</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.590" end="00:29:07.130" style="s2">my wife who&#39;s got like a genius IQ she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.220" end="00:29:09.230" style="s2">super left brain or can be right</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.130" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">like I would read Heidegger to it it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.230" end="00:29:12.560" style="s2">be some German word that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.990" style="s2">understand I couldn&#39;t pronounce and like</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.560" end="00:29:17.390" style="s2">I I&#39;d go I&#39;d be like I don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.990" end="00:29:21.910" style="s2">they go on Sheila no no go back there</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.390" end="00:29:24.830" style="s2">you got it&#39;s that word I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.910" end="00:29:26.570" style="s2">and you know we gotta go back there how</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.830" end="00:29:29.270" style="s2">we gonna understand I was like like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.570" end="00:29:32.210" style="s2">remember saying I mean if we just look</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.270" end="00:29:35.870" style="s2">it&#39;ll become it&#39;ll explain itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.210" end="00:29:38.750" style="s2">if we just keep reading and I was and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.870" end="00:29:40.310" style="s2">was like wait a minute you don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.750" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">you don&#39;t make that assumption I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.310" end="00:29:44.810" style="s2">like this may be the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.020" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">distinct right and so I think what ends</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.810" end="00:29:50.210" style="s2">up happening is it is very much like</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:52.730" style="s2">that like a paragraph or a character</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.210" end="00:29:56.750" style="s2">right cut like becomes kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.730" end="00:29:59.260" style="s2">character or a shape or yes yes yes you</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.750" end="00:30:02.150" style="s2">some kind right yes and then it and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.260" end="00:30:04.370" style="s2">it kind of goes along and then that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.150" end="00:30:06.770" style="s2">shape comes back again in a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.370" end="00:30:11.120" style="s2">context and it just starts to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.770" end="00:30:14.330" style="s2">itself it&#39;s like an over signification</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.120" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not the significance it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.330" end="00:30:20.210" style="s2">semantic significance it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:22.700" style="s2">kind of signification yeah that happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.210" end="00:30:25.400" style="s2">over and around the semantic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.700" end="00:30:29.630" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why we keep calling it the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.400" end="00:30:34.040" style="s2">character right yeah it&#39;s not like some</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.630" end="00:30:37.010" style="s2">strange chromatic right thing around the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.040" end="00:30:38.690" style="s2">actual text itself yes and I has</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.010" end="00:30:40.100" style="s2">something to do with the motion like</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.690" end="00:30:43.820" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.100" end="00:30:45.710" style="s2">implicit gesture in the language that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.820" end="00:30:48.110" style="s2">referring beyond the language that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.710" end="00:30:49.490" style="s2">I&#39;m tempted to say that you read somehow</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.110" end="00:30:50.570" style="s2">symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.490" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">I mean and it&#39;s like you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.570" end="00:30:55.610" style="s2">through ready text I mean you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:57.049" style="s2">it but you&#39;re also seeing through it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.610" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">right you&#39;re getting that translucent</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.049" end="00:31:01.940" style="s2">effect because because there&#39;s a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:04.580" style="s2">motion and a deeper gesture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.940" end="00:31:06.590" style="s2">happening in the composition and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.580" end="00:31:09.190" style="s2">why it&#39;s a police&#39; stright because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.590" end="00:31:11.450" style="s2">not like no matter how prosaic we are</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.190" end="00:31:13.880" style="s2">unless you&#39;re literally writing I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.450" end="00:31:15.470" style="s2">a drill manual maybe even when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.880" end="00:31:18.710" style="s2">writing a drill manual there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.470" end="00:31:20.360" style="s2">poesis that create the prosaic and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.710" end="00:31:22.520" style="s2">especially when people and philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.360" end="00:31:26.179" style="s2">have cultivated the police&#39;s as an</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.520" end="00:31:28.669" style="s2">indispensable form for the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.179" end="00:31:30.710" style="s2">right which obviously like but you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.669" end="00:31:32.179" style="s2">which which happened from Plato all the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.710" end="00:31:35.480" style="s2">way then on down right in Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.179" end="00:31:37.580" style="s2">like a perfect example of that then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.480" end="00:31:40.610" style="s2">like they understand that what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.580" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">doing is they are depicting the figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.610" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">of the philosophy there did the tracing</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">motions that you are meant to imitate</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:51.080" style="s2">yes not simply the propositional content</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s a motion that you&#39;re meant to</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.080" end="00:31:56.120" style="s2">enact and embody and that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">actually tempted to read much in the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.120" end="00:32:00.230" style="s2">that you are which would makes me a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">poor analytic philosopher why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.230" end="00:32:05.210" style="s2">have much of a desire to be one because</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">I I think yeah I think see I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.210" end="00:32:08.600" style="s2">more like you in that respect to like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:13.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll keep going as well typically</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.600" end="00:32:15.529" style="s2">because there&#39;s something about there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.130" end="00:32:18.370" style="s2">something about tracing the intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.529" end="00:32:22.100" style="s2">pattern that does not depend upon the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.370" end="00:32:24.260" style="s2">precision of every semantic composition</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.100" end="00:32:25.580" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s I think that&#39;s what we mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.260" end="00:32:27.710" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what you and I are trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:30.020" style="s2">to say by the character of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.710" end="00:32:33.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a pret that&#39;s the presencing of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.020" end="00:32:39.230" style="s2">it right totally yeah right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.470" end="00:32:42.230" style="s2">that yeah and then like listening to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:44.750" style="s2">people talk and there&#39;s in this gating</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.230" end="00:32:47.809" style="s2">kind of where they think I think we</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.750" end="00:32:50.059" style="s2">position see I&#39;m wondering about this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.809" end="00:32:51.710" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering about this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.059" end="00:32:56.120" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about right here and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.710" end="00:32:59.539" style="s2">if it has something to do with this this</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.120" end="00:33:01.470" style="s2">what speaking to us in this thing about</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.539" end="00:33:04.710" style="s2">the vulnerability of the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.470" end="00:33:10.220" style="s2">right and the vow structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.710" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">or the world right and and and how we</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.220" end="00:33:15.980" style="s2">this important part which is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:19.889" style="s2">fascinating of of without</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.980" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">personification mmm my my senses as</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.889" end="00:33:25.169" style="s2">something to do with this as something</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:30.360" style="s2">to do with that I think in a pre</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.169" end="00:33:33.720" style="s2">reflective way we have like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.360" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">phenomena the world like I think oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.720" end="00:33:41.129" style="s2">or before we think about it right</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:42.809" style="s2">there&#39;s a pre reflective character that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.129" end="00:33:45.929" style="s2">the world shows up that shows up as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.809" end="00:33:49.259" style="s2">who first era that&#39;s because I&#39;m huh</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.929" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">well that was um when I was around six</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.259" end="00:33:58.950" style="s2">or seven I remember this transition rate</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:34:02.970" style="s2">of when and and it&#39;s funny cuz I I it</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:05.820" style="s2">was so normal when I think back on it I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.970" end="00:34:08.040" style="s2">just kind of knew stuff and didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.820" end="00:34:09.030" style="s2">think about it but here is this period</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.040" end="00:34:10.980" style="s2">of time where I&#39;d go over to my</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.030" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">grandmother&#39;s house right which I spent</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:17.940" style="s2">a lot of time there and and I could and</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">I play this game with myself where all</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.940" end="00:34:22.950" style="s2">of a sudden I could start to tell like</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:26.579" style="s2">oh there&#39;s a way that the adults see the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.950" end="00:34:29.129" style="s2">room right or see the kitchen table or</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.579" end="00:34:31.139" style="s2">see the corner or see the tree or see</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.129" end="00:34:34.530" style="s2">the thing there&#39;s a way that they see it</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.139" end="00:34:36.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like a perspective shift right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.530" end="00:34:38.849" style="s2">owls and I could kind of like catch</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.540" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">glimpse of that and I think it was it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.849" end="00:34:42.270" style="s2">was like five six seven right around</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:43.319" style="s2">there so I think it probably had</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.270" end="00:34:48.149" style="s2">something to do with brain development</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.319" end="00:34:50.819" style="s2">to where where I could I could get</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.149" end="00:34:52.950" style="s2">myself to see it the way they saw in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.819" end="00:34:57.740" style="s2">way that they saw it was something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">more I don&#39;t know dimensional like and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.740" end="00:35:02.490" style="s2">then the way I saw it right with</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:04.619" style="s2">something more like the wall</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.490" end="00:35:06.420" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t dimensional it was more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.619" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">it was like a character that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.420" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">who it was ass it spoke it it suit it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:15.060" style="s2">saw me I saw it somehow it had that kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:18.330" style="s2">of quality of like you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.060" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">yes yes the world was a who war was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.330" end="00:35:22.230" style="s2">who and then I could but then I would go</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:24.060" style="s2">like okay how cool how long can I hold</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.230" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">the adult perspective and where the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.060" end="00:35:29.460" style="s2">hallway would go from a who to a box or</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:31.740" style="s2">something right and I would see how long</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.460" end="00:35:33.750" style="s2">I can like hold it without letting it go</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.740" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">and then it I&#39;d lose it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.750" end="00:35:39.030" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure out how to look back at</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.640" end="00:35:41.400" style="s2">it and then I could its I would like go</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.030" end="00:35:43.350" style="s2">like how did I see that before like if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.400" end="00:35:45.600" style="s2">saw the cube that way like I always</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.350" end="00:35:47.430" style="s2">where did I sit and I would remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.600" end="00:35:50.840" style="s2">like playing that game but right right</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.430" end="00:35:53.250" style="s2">right right right right oh that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.840" end="00:35:56.940" style="s2">and I think that there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.250" end="00:36:01.950" style="s2">think that I bet you I think at a pre</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.940" end="00:36:05.880" style="s2">reflective level we I think for sexually</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.950" end="00:36:17.070" style="s2">I think that&#39;s how we respond to our</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.880" end="00:36:18.270" style="s2">life like a who like yes oh yes yeah wow</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.070" end="00:36:19.530" style="s2">that was really good out there and all</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.270" end="00:36:23.250" style="s2">kinds of cool things and what you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.530" end="00:36:30.840" style="s2">said um oh so when you were describing</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.250" end="00:36:33.540" style="s2">this this this the the the the who ness</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.840" end="00:36:35.730" style="s2">of the world in the way that it first</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.540" end="00:36:38.370" style="s2">presents I can&#39;t help but think of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.730" end="00:36:40.620" style="s2">first miss right what what what Charles</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.100" end="00:36:48.540" style="s2">think what he meant by it is like a kind</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.590" end="00:37:12.180" style="s2">is just indistinct sense of presence and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.090" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">the world often to me in that state the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.180" end="00:37:17.550" style="s2">world often seems impressive as a whoo</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:19.230" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s not because it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.550" end="00:37:21.150" style="s2">we&#39;re not in a subject object state of</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.650" end="00:37:45.180" style="s2">and so we&#39;re simply impressed by the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.600" end="00:37:48.150" style="s2">sort of an indistinct present and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.180" end="00:37:50.190" style="s2">think that presence alludes itself as a</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.460" end="00:38:23.400" style="s2">first miss as that indistinct whoo yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.330" end="00:38:25.380" style="s2">and that we don&#39;t mean when we say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.400" end="00:38:27.060" style="s2">we don&#39;t mean that it is a being but we</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:31.830" style="s2">mean that it has the character of</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.830" end="00:38:36.210" style="s2">when you talked about cuz god I had this</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.690" end="00:38:38.040" style="s2">experience too and I have it still right</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.210" end="00:38:42.350" style="s2">when you were describing the experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.040" end="00:38:46.410" style="s2">of being a kid and seeing an object</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.350" end="00:38:48.750" style="s2">seeing the object but not seeing it</p>

<p begin="00:38:48.750" end="00:38:53.070" style="s2">right but you know knowing object is</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.580" end="00:38:56.910" style="s2">relational knowing because it takes on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.070" end="00:38:58.890" style="s2">character of reciprocal familiarity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.910" end="00:39:01.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s symbolic coupling to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.890" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">world I still feel that sometimes now</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.020" end="00:39:07.530" style="s2">like and I and it&#39;s funny it brings into</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.930" end="00:39:11.100" style="s2">consciousness a present same dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.530" end="00:39:15.930" style="s2">that is always at play I think yeah even</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.100" end="00:39:17.730" style="s2">toward Undine ammok objects like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.930" end="00:39:19.800" style="s2">it like there&#39;s a way in which the table</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.670" end="00:39:48.590" style="s2">that is and our relationship to any to</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.260" end="00:39:50.070" style="s2">our surroundings is dependent upon its</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.590" end="00:39:51.960" style="s2">characterization because its</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.180" end="00:39:58.500" style="s2">would say its relevance to us so the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.430" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">in which the relevant relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.500" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">the world depends upon its</p>

<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:09.840" style="s2">make a category mistake and call it a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.510" end="00:40:13.170" style="s2">being but it&#39;s it&#39;s its it harkens to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.840" end="00:40:15.360" style="s2">and refer somehow to the firstness of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.170" end="00:40:18.630" style="s2">its indistinct presence that is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.360" end="00:40:21.750" style="s2">presence of being as such right but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.630" end="00:40:25.830" style="s2">presence of being as such has presence</p>

<p begin="00:40:57.960" end="00:41:02.820" style="s2">right the relation that sense I know you</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.780" end="00:41:06.150" style="s2">that&#39;s a really it&#39;s really hard to get</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.150" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">I like I like a lot of times what I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.770" end="00:41:10.830" style="s2">just I&#39;ll just find myself doing this</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:13.740" style="s2">while I&#39;d be just sitting on the couch</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.830" end="00:41:18.330" style="s2">and I&#39;ll just be looking at stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.740" end="00:41:21.780" style="s2">there is quality like where it just it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.330" end="00:41:24.300" style="s2">just says something I don&#39;t know it&#39;s uh</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.100" end="00:41:30.390" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right it&#39;s got a tonality</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.600" end="00:41:33.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s a character disposition to</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.390" end="00:41:35.730" style="s2">it and it&#39;s it&#39;s nothing I&#39;m coming up</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.180" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">with I&#39;m just right it&#39;s before I come</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.730" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">up with in everything it&#39;s the initial I</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:49.350" style="s2">think um unarticulated familiarity right</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:53.220" style="s2">that upon which everything else arises</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.350" end="00:41:54.780" style="s2">from and kind of comes back to and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.220" end="00:41:55.170" style="s2">of the things about it is I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.780" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.170" end="00:41:58.109" style="s2">this kind of this is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:00.900" style="s2">when you think about it because it does</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.109" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2">have a particularity around it right</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.900" end="00:42:06.299" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the particular lampshade</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:08.430" style="s2">at the particular time of day</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.299" end="00:42:09.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a petite just like a character</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.430" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">right there yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.690" end="00:42:13.970" style="s2">makes it a character is it&#39;s like a you</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.630" style="s2">know they say of the face</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.970" end="00:42:19.559" style="s2">phenomenologically that the face is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.630" end="00:42:23.369" style="s2">probably the most like not like</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.559" end="00:42:24.960" style="s2">saturated experience of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.369" end="00:42:28.200" style="s2">anything that you have because it just</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.960" end="00:42:31.829" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing about what what the face</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.200" end="00:42:34.650" style="s2">emanates overflows from anything you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.829" end="00:42:38.040" style="s2">deduce by it right right all right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.650" end="00:42:41.490" style="s2">that we register faces right in desk</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.040" end="00:42:43.319" style="s2">arity that&#39;s that net that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.490" end="00:42:45.780" style="s2">make a whole lot of sense compared to</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.319" end="00:42:47.460" style="s2">the actual structures is that not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.780" end="00:42:49.170" style="s2">whole lot of difference right right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.460" end="00:42:51.960" style="s2">and that level is that like little</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.170" end="00:42:55.410" style="s2">microscopic levels of variation that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.960" end="00:42:57.859" style="s2">can&#39;t consciously appoint - yeah totally</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.410" end="00:43:01.020" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there is a quality of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.859" end="00:43:06.059" style="s2">familial familiarity and recognition</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.020" end="00:43:09.000" style="s2">that&#39;s like so pre reflective right yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.059" end="00:43:10.260" style="s2">it&#39;s our home right it&#39;s like it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.000" end="00:43:12.569" style="s2">of the things that you just look around</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.260" end="00:43:16.369" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a sense of normalcy if</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.569" end="00:43:21.089" style="s2">there&#39;s a feeling of normalcy right</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.369" end="00:43:23.099" style="s2">familiarity because that curtain is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.089" end="00:43:25.470" style="s2">spoken to you a thousand times</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.099" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know and you look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.470" end="00:43:32.339" style="s2">it presents itself yeah in in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:36.799" style="s2">but then if you look at it like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.339" end="00:43:41.549" style="s2">well what is something like what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.799" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">being not taking that into account how</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.549" end="00:43:47.609" style="s2">does that live out like and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:50.819" style="s2">lives out with shopping malls like strip</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.609" end="00:43:55.290" style="s2">housing complexes right these things</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.819" end="00:43:58.260" style="s2">that like basically take the stripped</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.510" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">just even even optimize its variances</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.569" end="00:44:09.120" style="s2">between each other and builds it all at</p>

<p begin="00:44:09.120" end="00:44:17.100" style="s2">that like I I feel at that place of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.560" end="00:44:20.570" style="s2">familiarity I feel a nullity and of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.100" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">inaccuracy in a nausea that is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.570" end="00:44:27.660" style="s2">literally is offensive like it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:30.210" style="s2">an ax feel and what&#39;s so offensive about</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.660" end="00:44:34.070" style="s2">it is that there&#39;s no one just like no</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.210" end="00:44:36.830" style="s2">one to blame it&#39;s like it&#39;s a halt on</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.500" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">feels like why is every but what&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.350" end="00:44:50.970" style="s2">is like is like very it what seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:55.110" style="s2">part of it is it no one who&#39;s walking</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.970" end="00:44:57.450" style="s2">around going this is awful that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.110" end="00:45:00.060" style="s2">of it so I think that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.450" end="00:45:01.830" style="s2">about what I&#39;m calling like well what</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.060" end="00:45:04.260" style="s2">why is it that this thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.830" end="00:45:07.590" style="s2">vulnerability of the world and the bow</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.260" end="00:45:10.290" style="s2">structure of the world like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.590" end="00:45:12.150" style="s2">thing that people have commented on you</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.290" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">have videos and it&#39;s drawing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.150" end="00:45:16.260" style="s2">thinking and it really asks lighting up</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:20.850" style="s2">for us too and I&#39;m just going what the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.260" end="00:45:22.260" style="s2">hell is it pointing to right mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.850" end="00:45:25.950" style="s2">really pointing to something that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.260" end="00:45:30.780" style="s2">think is not totally thought through its</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.950" end="00:45:34.140" style="s2">I was in a I was in uh I was in a text</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.780" end="00:45:39.450" style="s2">exchange with John about this but like</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.140" end="00:45:42.570" style="s2">going okay well you know cuz it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.450" end="00:45:47.390" style="s2">really interesting to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.570" end="00:45:53.460" style="s2">dow without personification right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.390" end="00:45:56.250" style="s2">and then thinking about Corbin and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.460" end="00:45:56.850" style="s2">imaginal right well actually that text</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.250" end="00:46:00.720" style="s2">that I sent you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.850" end="00:46:05.160" style="s2">yeah mm-hmm lines and this notion about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.720" end="00:46:07.740" style="s2">logical flesh that yes that Ponte</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.160" end="00:46:10.200" style="s2">started to flush flush out right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.740" end="00:46:12.680" style="s2">then he died before he kind of completed</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.200" end="00:46:15.330" style="s2">it which is really interesting you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.680" end="00:46:19.950" style="s2">but I&#39;m just wondering about this kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.330" end="00:46:22.790" style="s2">of if what we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.950" end="00:46:22.790" style="s2">touching on</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.799" end="00:46:27.959" style="s2">is touching into the restoration or the</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.309" end="00:46:31.799" style="s2">articulation of what we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.959" end="00:46:39.319" style="s2">at hi yeah I think so</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.799" end="00:46:41.789" style="s2">oh I think it is I think it is I I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.319" end="00:46:45.229" style="s2">it&#39;s such a it&#39;s such a stirring and</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.789" end="00:46:48.949" style="s2">provocative phrase the the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.229" end="00:46:52.920" style="s2">flesh it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.949" end="00:46:56.189" style="s2">locative ah it&#39;s so evocative because it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.920" end="00:46:59.130" style="s2">input because it I think it implies it</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.189" end="00:47:01.319" style="s2">connotes everything that we&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.130" end="00:47:04.410" style="s2">talking about right that the kid like</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.319" end="00:47:07.729" style="s2">the characterized flesh the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.410" end="00:47:10.559" style="s2">flesh has has character and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.729" end="00:47:12.689" style="s2">impresses with character and and it can</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.559" end="00:47:14.670" style="s2">be impressed and I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.689" end="00:47:16.259" style="s2">well part of what we mean by this idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.670" end="00:47:20.039" style="s2">of the vulnerability of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.259" end="00:47:25.199" style="s2">that can it be impressed by the relation</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.039" end="00:47:26.910" style="s2">we have with it and and and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.199" end="00:47:29.369" style="s2">answer in some ways has to be yes</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.910" end="00:47:32.609" style="s2">because it seems already to be true we</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.369" end="00:47:35.640" style="s2">seem to presuppose its truth by the way</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.609" end="00:47:37.229" style="s2">that we yeah by the character of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.640" end="00:47:39.269" style="s2">relationships we have with our</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.229" end="00:47:42.329" style="s2">environment like I don&#39;t think something</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.269" end="00:47:47.009" style="s2">like home having a home would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.329" end="00:47:50.459" style="s2">possible yeah if it weren&#39;t already true</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.009" end="00:47:53.489" style="s2">and already possible that the world was</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.459" end="00:47:58.259" style="s2">vulnerable right I think that in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.489" end="00:48:02.549" style="s2">way the interesting the significance of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.259" end="00:48:06.209" style="s2">home yeah the significance of home I</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.549" end="00:48:08.519" style="s2">think proposition Li and not a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.209" end="00:48:11.969" style="s2">percent even sure why or what I mean but</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.519" end="00:48:15.390" style="s2">I had this I had this inkling that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.969" end="00:48:20.189" style="s2">existence of home has everything to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.390" end="00:48:25.219" style="s2">with the cultivation and the and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.189" end="00:48:25.219" style="s2">envy and the perhaps the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:34.500" style="s2">the file eel errata cessation of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.570" end="00:48:37.810" style="s2">ontological flesh right at home is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.500" end="00:48:39.880" style="s2">like home in some ways is the progeny of</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.810" end="00:48:43.180" style="s2">consummating relation with the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">ontological flesh and and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.180" end="00:48:48.030" style="s2">mean having a house right although</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:50.410" style="s2">obviously a house can be a kin</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.030" end="00:48:52.150" style="s2">instrumentalize the idea of home and</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.410" end="00:48:54.610" style="s2">symbolize it but of course I mean home</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.150" end="00:48:56.740" style="s2">more I mean home in the sense that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.610" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">met before when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.740" end="00:48:59.860" style="s2">how when you&#39;re off in Europe somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:03.010" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.860" end="00:49:06.280" style="s2">your sense of identification here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.010" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">continues with you exactly exactly in</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.280" end="00:49:11.020" style="s2">the way that a relationship with someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:14.860" style="s2">continues with you even when you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.020" end="00:49:19.770" style="s2">with them physically so I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.860" end="00:49:23.740" style="s2">idea of home is a kind of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.770" end="00:49:25.480" style="s2">consummation with the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.740" end="00:49:27.940" style="s2">presence that emerges from that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.480" end="00:49:30.370" style="s2">consummation is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.940" end="00:49:36.330" style="s2">presence of belonging to and with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.370" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">world and and I and I like and when now</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.330" end="00:49:42.580" style="s2">the thing I struggle with is I</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:46.570" style="s2">understand the significance of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.580" end="00:49:50.820" style="s2">project of D personalizing or</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.570" end="00:49:56.440" style="s2">D personifying yeah but I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.820" end="00:50:01.960" style="s2">sometimes if it&#39;s phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.440" end="00:50:03.450" style="s2">possible to D personalized yeah I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.960" end="00:50:05.530" style="s2">if it&#39;s if not fun like</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.450" end="00:50:08.760" style="s2">phenomenologically possible within the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.530" end="00:50:11.710" style="s2">constraints of our grammar yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.760" end="00:50:14.610" style="s2">sufficiently D personalized or deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.710" end="00:50:19.060" style="s2">personify that presence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.610" end="00:50:21.220" style="s2">because I wonder if it&#39;s just I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.060" end="00:50:24.430" style="s2">if it&#39;s of necessity I wonder if the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.220" end="00:50:28.330" style="s2">personification of the world is of of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.430" end="00:50:31.600" style="s2">some kind of is of is a necessity of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.330" end="00:50:33.790" style="s2">species I wonder if it&#39;s a necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.600" end="00:50:36.520" style="s2">our ontological and phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.790" end="00:50:38.800" style="s2">grammar and then we have evolved with I</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.520" end="00:50:41.110" style="s2">wonder if we can get outside of it and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.800" end="00:50:44.470" style="s2">so wonder if it&#39;s necessary to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.110" end="00:50:46.870" style="s2">outside of it because I think now you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.470" end="00:50:48.430" style="s2">know creating an idolatrous tyranny from</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.870" end="00:50:50.500" style="s2">the personification is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.430" end="00:50:53.590" style="s2">something as a problem we&#39;re aware of</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.500" end="00:50:55.780" style="s2">and that we don&#39;t want to repurpose a t&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.590" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">or rien semmen 8 and I get that and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.780" end="00:51:01.990" style="s2">know that&#39;s John&#39;s preoccupation as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:04.780" style="s2">is to not succumb the is to not take the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.990" end="00:51:08.020" style="s2">pet the project of vowing the world and</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.780" end="00:51:11.910" style="s2">devolve it into the literalism of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.020" end="00:51:16.090" style="s2">beingness in actuality I get that but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.910" end="00:51:19.990" style="s2">I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;m not convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.090" end="00:51:24.730" style="s2">it&#39;s possible or or necessary yeah -</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.990" end="00:51:27.340" style="s2">completely d personify the world because</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.730" end="00:51:30.910" style="s2">I wonder how much the constraints of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.340" end="00:51:33.660" style="s2">grammar yeah like our primordial grammar</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.910" end="00:51:36.190" style="s2">not like our linguistic our primordial</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.660" end="00:51:37.720" style="s2">archetypal grammar I guess this is where</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.190" end="00:51:39.880" style="s2">the young comes out of me - like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.720" end="00:51:43.630" style="s2">wonder if like if we have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.880" end="00:51:46.840" style="s2">archetypal grammar that depends upon the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.630" end="00:51:49.690" style="s2">personification of perennial cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.840" end="00:51:51.700" style="s2">structures yeah that give edifice to our</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.690" end="00:51:56.560" style="s2">meaning relationship with the world I</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.700" end="00:51:58.720" style="s2">wonder if it&#39;s possible to divest</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.560" end="00:52:01.930" style="s2">ourselves from that archetypal grammar</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.720" end="00:52:03.970" style="s2">of personification Oh find the thou of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.930" end="00:52:05.800" style="s2">the world I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.970" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;ve struggled with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.800" end="00:52:10.150" style="s2">that that the thing I&#39;m wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:13.060" style="s2">it just kind of dawn on me I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.150" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">wondering if the sense of the danger</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.060" end="00:52:21.610" style="s2">that comes it has us resist right</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:25.210" style="s2">putting a person or a being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.610" end="00:52:28.020" style="s2">personified if actually the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.210" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">think about it now is actually not</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.020" end="00:52:31.930" style="s2">because I&#39;m just thinking about like</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:35.410" style="s2">well what how do I know you&#39;re a person</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.930" end="00:52:37.750" style="s2">what does that mean like huh right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.410" end="00:52:39.640" style="s2">like you&#39;re you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.750" end="00:52:42.040" style="s2">I think precisely what makes you a</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.640" end="00:52:44.370" style="s2">person and not someone else is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.040" end="00:52:49.480" style="s2">in the sense that I can&#39;t I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.370" end="00:52:52.600" style="s2">deduce you to something determinate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.480" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">will just be unless I get in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.600" end="00:52:58.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a right there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:53:00.790" style="s2">the person you&#39;re not an entity well I</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.150" end="00:53:03.970" style="s2">guess you&#39;re an entity yeah yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.790" end="00:53:05.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re not a you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.970" end="00:53:07.690" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have a nature like a tree</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.890" end="00:53:09.910" style="s2">as in nature or you don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.690" end="00:53:12.400" style="s2">essence like a tree as this is what</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.910" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">Aristotle I think got it right is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.400" end="00:53:17.050" style="s2">that you called natural being is is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:20.710" style="s2">real as long as nothing gets in its way</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.050" end="00:53:25.540" style="s2">it realizes it&#39;s Talos we&#39;re not at all</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.710" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">like like we do have a nature we did</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.540" end="00:53:33.490" style="s2">there is it there is a nature to us but</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:37.590" style="s2">part of that nature is is is in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.490" end="00:53:40.030" style="s2">impression ability and in honor in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.590" end="00:53:43.330" style="s2">vulnerability that also allows for our</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.030" end="00:53:48.310" style="s2">expanse ability and our power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.330" end="00:53:53.380" style="s2">precisely that we don&#39;t we don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.310" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">unfold right we all commune yeah in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.380" end="00:54:00.370" style="s2">nature of like so being a person isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.230" end="00:54:02.710" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you&#39;re a thing that that</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.370" end="00:54:04.510" style="s2">is somehow final in fact you&#39;re a person</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.710" end="00:54:06.790" style="s2">precisely because you don&#39;t have there</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.510" end="00:54:10.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t something total final to you other</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.790" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">than your death right which kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.150" end="00:54:16.860" style="s2">defines your mortality so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:19.120" style="s2">thing to think about like well if we and</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.860" end="00:54:20.890" style="s2">that&#39;s a property the world seems to</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">share - yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.890" end="00:54:26.050" style="s2">and there&#39;s that kind of sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:29.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not an individual right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.050" end="00:54:32.350" style="s2">the the older notion of to be a person</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.530" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">right I believe is like when I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.350" end="00:54:36.550" style="s2">about an individual the notion of an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:41.050" style="s2">individual versus the notion of a person</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.550" end="00:54:42.730" style="s2">ah eventually be a person yes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.050" end="00:54:44.860" style="s2">individual I get this sense of just I</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.730" end="00:54:46.900" style="s2">get I see a bunch of well in division</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.860" end="00:54:50.550" style="s2">right I see a bunch of little categories</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.900" end="00:54:56.890" style="s2">right that are individual you yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.550" end="00:54:58.840" style="s2">right but a person the uber individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.890" end="00:55:03.730" style="s2">behind that then you get into all those</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.840" end="00:55:06.130" style="s2">dangers however be a person seems to</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.730" end="00:55:11.230" style="s2">have more of a sense of like the person</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.130" end="00:55:15.130" style="s2">is that it seems like the site of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.230" end="00:55:18.369" style="s2">other the site for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.130" end="00:55:21.670" style="s2">possibility of the other man in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.369" end="00:55:22.509" style="s2">possible the possibility of its future</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.670" end="00:55:30.849" style="s2">communion</p>
