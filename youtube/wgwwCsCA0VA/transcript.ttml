<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:32.340" style="s2">so anyway maybe you just want to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:35.340" style="s2">something about yourself a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.340" end="00:01:38.670" style="s2">what&#39;s your what&#39;s your what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.340" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">vision what&#39;s your story I think you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.670" end="00:01:43.229" style="s2">call it a lot of it or some of it at</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">least it is true that I&#39;ve been working</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.229" end="00:01:50.700" style="s2">on money for the last yes into some</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">extent I still am working on money so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.700" end="00:01:59.689" style="s2">I&#39;m not an economist I&#39;m a sociology /</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:02:03.080" style="s2">philosopher so that allows me to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.689" end="00:02:06.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve stepped into this field of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.080" end="00:02:08.509" style="s2">economics through the backdoor which has</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.590" end="00:02:10.910" style="s2">allowed me to sort of open up very basic</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.509" end="00:02:15.050" style="s2">questions which the field itself hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.910" end="00:02:17.989" style="s2">really asked I or at least taught not to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.050" end="00:02:20.450" style="s2">a large degree and and one of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.989" end="00:02:21.560" style="s2">questions is exactly what is money and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.450" end="00:02:23.750" style="s2">more importantly where does money come</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.560" end="00:02:27.650" style="s2">from so that&#39;s something I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.750" end="00:02:30.020" style="s2">engaged with but then in recent years or</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.650" end="00:02:33.709" style="s2">the last one or two years I&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.020" end="00:02:37.700" style="s2">very interested in men&#39;s work which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.709" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">why we&#39;ve met and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.700" end="00:02:42.709" style="s2">that&#39;s that interests me both from a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">personal point of view because I am a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.709" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">man so and I like being a man and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">think that&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:02:58.370" style="s2">potential in being a man I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:03:01.760" style="s2">sometimes we tend to think of you both</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.370" end="00:03:03.590" style="s2">men and women or at least or in I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.760" end="00:03:03.950" style="s2">like to what gender but I&#39;m gonna use it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.590" end="00:03:06.769" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.950" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">but sometimes we think of gender as a as</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.769" end="00:03:10.940" style="s2">a liability something it&#39;s better if we</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:13.070" style="s2">don&#39;t have a gender and it&#39;s better if</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.940" end="00:03:16.040" style="s2">our gender doesn&#39;t really count in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.070" end="00:03:18.350" style="s2">the relations we into and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.040" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">wrong I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think gender</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.350" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">should be a liability I think it should</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:30.680" style="s2">be an asset for me it&#39;s a nice asset and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">it&#39;s something that I don&#39;t think we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.680" end="00:03:35.660" style="s2">utilizing enough in our society in our</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:38.030" style="s2">culture and certainly it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.660" end="00:03:40.609" style="s2">something that I found that the more I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.030" end="00:03:43.609" style="s2">can use utilize that asset in my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.609" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">life the banner in the mirror for me the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.609" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">better for my wife the better for my</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:51.500" style="s2">kids the better for my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:55.220" style="s2">everything so that&#39;s and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.500" end="00:03:59.930" style="s2">what&#39;s meant work is about for me okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.220" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">so so um masculinity as an asset that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.930" end="00:04:03.709" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing you saying um I have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:05.540" style="s2">kind of theory I want to just put</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.709" end="00:04:07.820" style="s2">forward which I think is related okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.540" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a Zen phrase that that says you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.820" end="00:04:09.440" style="s2">know first there are mountains and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">rivers</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.440" end="00:04:13.010" style="s2">and then there are no mountains and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:14.540" style="s2">rivers anymore and then mountains and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.010" end="00:04:15.950" style="s2">rivers or mountains and rivers again</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.540" end="00:04:19.070" style="s2">have you heard that before</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.950" end="00:04:22.220" style="s2">twosome phrase I think I&#39;ve heard it but</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.070" end="00:04:23.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I understood it so one way</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.220" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">to look at this as mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.990" end="00:04:28.250" style="s2">or is masculine and mescaline and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:30.020" style="s2">masculine and the feminine right yes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.250" end="00:04:32.600" style="s2">there is a sense that in our society</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.020" end="00:04:34.580" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of lost that and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.600" end="00:04:36.140" style="s2">hunt our mountains and rivers are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.580" end="00:04:38.450" style="s2">mountains and rivers again right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.140" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">then it seems to be at this point in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.450" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">history or in this point in society</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:45.710" style="s2">there seems to be an interest again in</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">in discovering this this distinction</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.710" end="00:04:49.580" style="s2">between men and women and why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:54.470" style="s2">important and why it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.580" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">something to throw away or yeah that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.470" end="00:05:03.260" style="s2">very true that is very true and I am but</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:04.970" style="s2">I would add that I think um because I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.260" end="00:05:07.610" style="s2">also think about this philosophically I</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.970" end="00:05:08.990" style="s2">think I&#39;ve kind of figured out this one</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.610" end="00:05:12.050" style="s2">of the reasons why I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.990" end="00:05:13.610" style="s2">would gender is because gender starts as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.050" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">soon as you start talking about gender</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.610" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">you&#39;re invited to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:20.419" style="s2">distinctions or the differences between</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.190" style="s2">men and women and I do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.419" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">there are plenty of differences however</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.190" end="00:05:26.510" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that the question of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">is the difference between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.510" end="00:05:34.450" style="s2">is the best question to ask so I like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:38.090" style="s2">ask more what does it mean to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.450" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">man could also be what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.090" end="00:05:41.810" style="s2">be a woman I don&#39;t know too much about</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:44.060" style="s2">that because I am a man so I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">interested in what does it mean to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.060" end="00:05:48.890" style="s2">man mhm and it&#39;s not the same question</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:51.290" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m also this is this is something</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.890" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">that I&#39;ve become very unaware of in my</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.290" end="00:05:56.000" style="s2">work on money the thing is when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:06:00.530" style="s2">approach the question of money we</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.000" end="00:06:02.540" style="s2">sometimes are in economics this attempt</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.530" end="00:06:04.940" style="s2">you to ask the wrong questions about</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.540" end="00:06:07.820" style="s2">money so we we tend to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.940" end="00:06:09.650" style="s2">about what is the price of this or what</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.820" end="00:06:12.200" style="s2">are the relative prices between this and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.650" end="00:06:15.410" style="s2">there and how however why is this more</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">valuable than this and so forth but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.410" end="00:06:19.970" style="s2">basic questions of money such as where</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:22.610" style="s2">does money come from tends to get lost</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.970" end="00:06:23.370" style="s2">in that and it&#39;s the same in the field</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.610" end="00:06:25.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.370" end="00:06:27.090" style="s2">men and women I think when we start</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.920" end="00:06:29.580" style="s2">talking about what are the differences</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.090" end="00:06:32.970" style="s2">between men and women we sort of get</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.580" end="00:06:34.620" style="s2">sidetracked in a way yes I think these</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.970" end="00:06:36.510" style="s2">are the questions like so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.620" end="00:06:40.640" style="s2">what does it mean to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.510" end="00:06:43.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a puts us on another path and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.640" end="00:06:45.210" style="s2">having said that I mean again there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.260" end="00:06:48.120" style="s2">differences between men and women but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.210" end="00:06:50.340" style="s2">think if we approach the question from</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.120" end="00:06:53.220" style="s2">another angle</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.340" end="00:06:55.890" style="s2">we get to a different point yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.220" end="00:06:57.600" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting well obviously we we</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.890" end="00:06:59.820" style="s2">define ourselves through difference in</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.600" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">some kind of a way I mean you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.820" end="00:07:04.770" style="s2">a man we&#39;re even the word woman has the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">word man inside of it so there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.770" end="00:07:10.980" style="s2">know I think there is a difference but</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:13.470" style="s2">maybe what you&#39;re saying is that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.980" end="00:07:15.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a more deeper question is when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.470" end="00:07:20.700" style="s2">look at it in yourself or does that make</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.690" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">sense I&#39;m not you said something about</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.700" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">so you said we identify ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:30.630" style="s2">through differences mm-hmm and I know I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the Sociology that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.630" end="00:07:35.130" style="s2">brought up with that this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:36.750" style="s2">thinking in differences all the time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.130" end="00:07:40.890" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s just I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.750" end="00:07:44.210" style="s2">necessarily true how is it I mean what</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.890" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">what if I just I just identify as a main</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.210" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">periods and then regardless of and some</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:53.700" style="s2">of the things I mean there&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:07:55.680" style="s2">things in me that come out when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.700" end="00:07:57.450" style="s2">identify as man which are probably the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.680" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">same in women and then there&#39;s some that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.450" end="00:08:04.020" style="s2">aren&#39;t but it but still it kind of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:06.210" style="s2">matters to me that I am I mean okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.020" end="00:08:08.580" style="s2">so the way the way I&#39;ve tried to work</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.210" end="00:08:09.930" style="s2">with it I have I can show you this not</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.580" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">that it&#39;s important but it&#39;s just here</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.930" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">on my this is my just one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:14.550" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.620" style="s2">this is Heidegger right I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.550" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">bring Heidegger up because because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.620" end="00:08:26.300" style="s2">know that you&#39;re a big fan of Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:29.670" style="s2">and so this sign on site is in this book</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.300" end="00:08:31.980" style="s2">Heidegger he talks about he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.670" end="00:08:34.170" style="s2">main or not man in the sense of main</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.980" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">woman but in the sense of human being</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.170" end="00:08:41.340" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t want use the word</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:45.470" style="s2">human being uses the web design so which</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.340" end="00:08:48.150" style="s2">is kind of like a it&#39;s a genderless</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.470" end="00:08:50.760" style="s2">being in a sense right but he talks</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.150" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2">about what does it mean to be a human</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.760" end="00:08:55.530" style="s2">being what it was mean to be designed so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:58.410" style="s2">and one of the things that he says is</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.530" end="00:09:04.680" style="s2">that design that the human being is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.410" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">distinguished by through the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.680" end="00:09:11.580" style="s2">our being is an issue for us so for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:14.190" style="s2">as a design my own being is an issue for</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.580" end="00:09:15.420" style="s2">me so it&#39;s my own being is something</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.190" end="00:09:17.820" style="s2">that I kind of have to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.420" end="00:09:19.650" style="s2">with I have to investigate it understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.820" end="00:09:23.700" style="s2">it but I also have to realize it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.650" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">live it so within a time right within</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.700" end="00:09:29.700" style="s2">time and the fact of mortality and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">exactly yeah so what I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.700" end="00:09:34.770" style="s2">do or what I&#39;m trying to do in my work</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.580" end="00:09:37.830" style="s2">at the moment is to say what does that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.770" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">look like if we use these ideas concepts</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.830" end="00:09:42.690" style="s2">to understand what it means to be a main</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:44.070" style="s2">well what would that look like and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.690" end="00:09:46.260" style="s2">what I&#39;ve one of things I&#39;ve come up</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.070" end="00:09:51.090" style="s2">with is that I think what distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.260" end="00:09:55.470" style="s2">a man it is that he has to come to terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.090" end="00:09:57.570" style="s2">with what it means to be a man yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.470" end="00:10:00.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s basically what</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.570" end="00:10:02.310" style="s2">defines or what what distinguishes me as</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.690" end="00:10:04.830" style="s2">a man is that yeah I have to come to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.310" end="00:10:07.080" style="s2">terms with it and of course we can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.830" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">that in many different ways but we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.080" end="00:10:14.730" style="s2">get around this question we just you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:18.450" style="s2">need to figure out what kind of a man do</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.730" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">I want to be that&#39;s like our life task</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.450" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">in a way mm-hmm and then you can try and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:26.280" style="s2">escape this life task you can stay a boy</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:29.550" style="s2">for all of your for your entire life</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.280" end="00:10:31.260" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good strategy or at least I</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.550" end="00:10:34.020" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good strategy you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.260" end="00:10:36.810" style="s2">can also try to say ah no no no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.020" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">want that I don&#39;t even want to identify</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.810" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">as a man I want to I could be any gender</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:47.670" style="s2">whatever can be on dragonis or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:49.649" style="s2">something like this and you say well</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.670" end="00:10:55.499" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s one way then of being</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.649" end="00:10:57.059" style="s2">man is to be whatever something but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.499" end="00:10:59.369" style="s2">think there&#39;s certain sometimes they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.059" end="00:11:02.009" style="s2">also be an element of trying to escape</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.369" end="00:11:04.410" style="s2">yourself in that mm-hmm right because</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.009" end="00:11:06.329" style="s2">because why is that Kinect gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.410" end="00:11:08.189" style="s2">interrupt why is that question so sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.329" end="00:11:11.100" style="s2">of offensive to people right yeah at</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.189" end="00:11:12.269" style="s2">this time it&#39;s like it&#39;s like people</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:15.029" style="s2">want to if when you ask this question</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.269" end="00:11:16.740" style="s2">you know what it means to be a man and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.029" end="00:11:18.449" style="s2">then people are almost offended by that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.740" end="00:11:20.999" style="s2">right yeah you know what I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.449" end="00:11:23.399" style="s2">like it&#39;s it seems to be no I&#39;m a person</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.999" end="00:11:25.319" style="s2">you know yeah why do I have to be you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.399" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">know why do I have to distinguish myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.319" end="00:11:30.689" style="s2">as a man right</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:33.110" style="s2">I think excuse me I&#39;m a little sick ya</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.689" end="00:11:38.540" style="s2">know if we have it we have a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.110" end="00:11:42.209" style="s2">that so this being a person for instance</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.540" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">is not a it doesn&#39;t really come with</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.209" end="00:11:47.850" style="s2">very many commitments or obligations</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">it&#39;s you being a person is something</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.850" end="00:11:52.589" style="s2">wrong the minute you&#39;re born you are a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.559" style="s2">person hmm you don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.589" end="00:11:57.089" style="s2">to be a person it&#39;s free innocence so</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.559" end="00:11:59.459" style="s2">being a man is something we need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.089" end="00:12:02.189" style="s2">become right it&#39;s not something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.459" end="00:12:04.889" style="s2">just happens to us thank you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.189" end="00:12:06.839" style="s2">being a man has this duality yes it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.889" end="00:12:08.910" style="s2">something you&#39;re born with a penis and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.839" end="00:12:10.379" style="s2">and then at some point you become a man</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.910" end="00:12:13.019" style="s2">but at the same time we have this sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.379" end="00:12:15.240" style="s2">that no it&#39;s also an ethical obligation</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.019" end="00:12:17.129" style="s2">so there&#39;s something you need to fulfill</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.240" end="00:12:19.189" style="s2">something you need to do something and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.129" end="00:12:22.339" style="s2">of course that&#39;s that can be like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.189" end="00:12:26.300" style="s2">should kind of do that and what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.339" end="00:12:29.429" style="s2">it&#39;s terrifying in a way it&#39;s an anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.300" end="00:12:31.829" style="s2">provoking because it may come with all</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.429" end="00:12:34.170" style="s2">these obligations and responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.829" end="00:12:37.410" style="s2">and all these kind and also the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.170" end="00:12:40.319" style="s2">possibility of failure you can&#39;t as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.410" end="00:12:42.839" style="s2">person you can&#39;t really fail I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.319" end="00:12:45.360" style="s2">not like yeah oh then I&#39;m not opposed</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.839" end="00:12:49.759" style="s2">but as a man you can fail well you could</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.360" end="00:12:52.259" style="s2">be subhuman you could be less than human</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.759" end="00:12:55.319" style="s2">yeah but would you be less than you mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.259" end="00:12:57.019" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be less than human by</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.319" end="00:12:59.790" style="s2">virtue of something you do yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.019" end="00:13:02.040" style="s2">isn&#39;t it something you become by virtue</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.790" end="00:13:03.450" style="s2">of something that someone else does to</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.040" end="00:13:05.700" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.450" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">and of course I mean it&#39;s also I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.700" end="00:13:08.820" style="s2">course you can be good personal no</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:09.990" style="s2">that&#39;s just some semantic I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.820" end="00:13:12.120" style="s2">following what you&#39;re saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.990" end="00:13:12.690" style="s2">and I agree it has something to do also</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.120" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.690" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">what you were saying before about being</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">becoming right yeah in this high</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:23.460" style="s2">daguerreian sense like yes yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:26.820" style="s2">it is true that people can offend it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.460" end="00:13:30.180" style="s2">I think below this offense bill low this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.820" end="00:13:32.820" style="s2">and anger also I think below that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.180" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">feeling there&#39;s another feeling which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.820" end="00:13:39.060" style="s2">a feeling of anxiety or a feeling of oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:42.030" style="s2">maybe I can&#39;t do this or maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.060" end="00:13:46.620" style="s2">good enough or maybe I can&#39;t live up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.030" end="00:13:48.780" style="s2">this so I think so I think behind all</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.620" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">these feelings that come out that do</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.780" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">come out when when you say some of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:55.380" style="s2">things sometimes come out when you say</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">some of these things there are actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.380" end="00:13:59.610" style="s2">other kinds of feeling and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:02.510" style="s2">should take these I mean I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.610" end="00:14:04.680" style="s2">think that we should take these feelings</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.510" end="00:14:15.270" style="s2">seriously I mean because they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.680" end="00:14:20.190" style="s2">serious so and so maybe I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.270" end="00:14:25.380" style="s2">it of course I mean when I say that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.190" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a being a becoming a man is kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.380" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">of like an ethical obligation that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:35.910" style="s2">particular there&#39;s a specific formula of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">the kind of man that you then have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.910" end="00:14:41.340" style="s2">become I mean there&#39;s plenty of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:45.870" style="s2">be a main force so so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.340" end="00:14:48.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a an openness in it but still it</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.870" end="00:14:50.910" style="s2">is sort of a life challenge or something</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.180" end="00:14:53.280" style="s2">like tasks you have to take upon</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.910" end="00:14:56.700" style="s2">yourself I was thinking as you were</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.280" end="00:14:59.280" style="s2">speaking um you know you know I need she</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.700" end="00:15:02.310" style="s2">he talks about how philosophers ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.280" end="00:15:04.200" style="s2">are really there their biography in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.310" end="00:15:07.050" style="s2">some kind of a way right so then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.200" end="00:15:08.250" style="s2">wanted to I wanted to ask you about why</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.050" end="00:15:11.430" style="s2">that&#39;s of interest to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.250" end="00:15:13.800" style="s2">right why this becoming a man is of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.430" end="00:15:15.420" style="s2">interest to you and why why why do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.800" end="00:15:18.840" style="s2">feel this need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.420" end="00:15:20.490" style="s2">- let&#39;s say become a man or why do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.840" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">because you know I can relate to that as</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">well yeah I think I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:30.420" style="s2">everyone mmm I think all men and boys</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.290" end="00:15:32.310" style="s2">certainly they also have that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.420" end="00:15:33.900" style="s2">especially when they when boys when they</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.310" end="00:15:36.690" style="s2">start becoming less I have two sons</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.900" end="00:15:40.830" style="s2">they&#39;re 12 and 16 so they&#39;re right at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.690" end="00:15:44.100" style="s2">that age where they they feel that urge</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.830" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">or that calling to become min so they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.100" end="00:15:50.550" style="s2">compare yeah working on that so we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:55.560" style="s2">that but it&#39;s also true as you sit or I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.550" end="00:15:57.780" style="s2">think there&#39;s also reasons why someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.560" end="00:15:59.430" style="s2">like myself call you or I mean we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.780" end="00:16:03.240" style="s2">have reasons for why we then become</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.430" end="00:16:07.290" style="s2">perhaps extra interested in this and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.240" end="00:16:10.110" style="s2">for me I think mmm I mean at least one</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.290" end="00:16:15.540" style="s2">of things I mean I&#39;ve some years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.110" end="00:16:17.700" style="s2">was divorced and my oldest son he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.540" end="00:16:21.780" style="s2">like I had a conflict with his mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.700" end="00:16:27.660" style="s2">and and so what happened there was that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.780" end="00:16:33.750" style="s2">my role as a father sort of became was</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.660" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">challenged so I was I mean I was yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.750" end="00:16:39.630" style="s2">there was challenges there and and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:41.670" style="s2">also some kind of a crisis there so and</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.630" end="00:16:47.400" style="s2">and I think so that&#39;s been part of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.670" end="00:16:49.530" style="s2">that this has made me aware of yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.400" end="00:16:52.770" style="s2">so the crisis that&#39;s interesting I it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.530" end="00:16:55.020" style="s2">also think that Matt you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.770" end="00:16:57.570" style="s2">discovering or growing into manhood is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.020" end="00:17:00.540" style="s2">always related to at least some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.570" end="00:17:02.700" style="s2">a crisis yeah and in the beginning that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.540" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">used to be dealt with through rites of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.700" end="00:17:07.710" style="s2">passage and and that kind of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:09.720" style="s2">today we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.710" end="00:17:13.260" style="s2">kind of formal rites of passage so often</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.720" end="00:17:15.450" style="s2">we we go through a crisis yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.260" end="00:17:18.690" style="s2">that that sort of makes us think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.450" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s important for us to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.690" end="00:17:22.500" style="s2">be men rather than be just like our</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:25.140" style="s2">wives are just like other people or</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.500" end="00:17:28.230" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of distinction and no</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.140" end="00:17:28.740" style="s2">does that make sense yeah it does make</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.230" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.740" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">and I I can notice I mean for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:36.420" style="s2">actually I wanna add I just came just</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:38.520" style="s2">two weeks ago I went on a rite of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.420" end="00:17:41.700" style="s2">passage with my son my oldest son all</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.520" end="00:17:44.610" style="s2">right with her name on a Rubenstein you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.700" end="00:17:47.730" style="s2">also are familiar with I guess and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.610" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">was amazing I mean amazing it for three</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.730" end="00:17:54.150" style="s2">days and for him and for me and for our</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">relation it was just one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.150" end="00:18:00.260" style="s2">things I&#39;ve done in my life really</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:01.830" style="s2">amazing and it&#39;s true as you say that</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.260" end="00:18:05.090" style="s2">mmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.830" end="00:18:07.560" style="s2">I mean we need to what rites of passage</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.090" end="00:18:10.080" style="s2">passages what they do is that they mark</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.560" end="00:18:11.520" style="s2">sort of transitions in our lives and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.080" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">most important transition is the one</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.520" end="00:18:16.950" style="s2">from being a boy to becoming a young man</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">but there&#39;s also other like and I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.950" end="00:18:23.310" style="s2">for me I went from being a man to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.730" end="00:18:25.110" style="s2">becoming a father and in the process it</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.310" end="00:18:27.410" style="s2">was a crisis and all these kind of and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.110" end="00:18:31.080" style="s2">me that became a rite of passage also</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.410" end="00:18:34.580" style="s2">yeah really huge struggle so for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.080" end="00:18:38.010" style="s2">becoming a father was not just something</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.580" end="00:18:40.050" style="s2">it was something that I discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.010" end="00:18:43.680" style="s2">this is something I also have to work on</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.050" end="00:18:46.440" style="s2">or work for and struggle for so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.680" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">done a lot of work on that mmm and as I</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.440" end="00:18:50.310" style="s2">was doing it of course with these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:52.500" style="s2">it was like it&#39;s hard work and it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.310" end="00:18:53.580" style="s2">more hard working if you have even if if</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.500" end="00:18:55.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a conflict with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.580" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">mother it&#39;s hard work still but then if</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.800" end="00:19:02.250" style="s2">you if you also have a conflict with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:04.950" style="s2">mother so I&#39;ve done a lot of very hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.250" end="00:19:06.630" style="s2">work but I&#39;ve also learned a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.950" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">things from that and one things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.630" end="00:19:16.170" style="s2">learned is the value of is how men how</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:18.030" style="s2">we can help each other I mean if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.170" end="00:19:21.180" style="s2">hadn&#39;t been for other men who helped me</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.030" end="00:19:25.170" style="s2">mm-hmm know what I would have been crazy</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.180" end="00:19:31.590" style="s2">I&#39;m sure so I really also discovered the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.170" end="00:19:33.300" style="s2">value of friendship and yeah it seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.590" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">like that male friendship is something</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.300" end="00:19:38.610" style="s2">extremely valuable and I also think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.510" end="00:19:40.440" style="s2">it&#39;s something that is kind of mocked in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.610" end="00:19:42.510" style="s2">popular culture it&#39;s kind of made fun of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.440" end="00:19:45.150" style="s2">its kind of yes it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.510" end="00:19:47.460" style="s2">seen as a serious as a serious and</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.150" end="00:19:50.220" style="s2">beautiful business right now it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.460" end="00:19:52.920" style="s2">seen as a you know caricature does a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.220" end="00:19:55.350" style="s2">bunch of you know dumbass dabs going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.920" end="00:19:57.780" style="s2">the football game or drinking beer and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.350" end="00:20:00.990" style="s2">you know being could have dragged around</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.780" end="00:20:03.780" style="s2">I think and I think the lives or</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.990" end="00:20:06.990" style="s2">something like that so so so so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.780" end="00:20:10.230" style="s2">also I completely agree with you I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.990" end="00:20:14.850" style="s2">that I think that this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.230" end="00:20:19.200" style="s2">discovered late in life is is the value</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.850" end="00:20:20.940" style="s2">and the importance you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.200" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">the difficulty but also the beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.940" end="00:20:26.610" style="s2">male friendships mmm no that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean I&#39;ve had throughout my</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.610" end="00:20:33.150" style="s2">life I&#39;ve had many close friendships and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:36.930" style="s2">most of the time I&#39;ve actually always</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.150" end="00:20:39.840" style="s2">had like one or a few very very close</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.930" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">friends so this is something I&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.840" end="00:20:45.510" style="s2">valued but I think as I grow older I</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:48.620" style="s2">just come to value it even more and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.510" end="00:20:51.720" style="s2">you say that in a culture there&#39;s some I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.620" end="00:20:54.840" style="s2">think there&#39;s a suspicion or there sir I</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.720" end="00:20:57.870" style="s2">think because there&#39;s a deep because</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.840" end="00:20:59.610" style="s2">friendships are so powerful the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.870" end="00:21:02.340" style="s2">that men can do together when they get</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.610" end="00:21:04.890" style="s2">together they can do really really</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.340" end="00:21:08.250" style="s2">powerful things and I think in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.890" end="00:21:10.770" style="s2">joining society they said our society</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.250" end="00:21:12.600" style="s2">knows that so here Anna knows well if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.770" end="00:21:16.110" style="s2">want to control the population or if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.600" end="00:21:19.260" style="s2">want to control Society let&#39;s not have</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.110" end="00:21:21.060" style="s2">too many friendships friendships right</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.260" end="00:21:23.820" style="s2">because that while that power can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.060" end="00:21:26.040" style="s2">positive or negative right it can be yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.820" end="00:21:28.800" style="s2">it can be tear a terrorist group or it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.040" end="00:21:31.560" style="s2">can be a band of brothers working</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.800" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">together to make you know something</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.560" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">something great or it could be all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:39.930" style="s2">of things right and also just you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:44.310" style="s2">say well some of the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.930" end="00:21:46.350" style="s2">energies that men would put into French</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.310" end="00:21:47.430" style="s2">chips I mean if they don&#39;t Francis maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.350" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">they would put it into their work</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.430" end="00:21:52.680" style="s2">instead and maybe that&#39;s better for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:54.660" style="s2">corporation or whatever so they they</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.680" end="00:21:56.220" style="s2">kind of want us to expend that energy</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.660" end="00:22:00.390" style="s2">into that system Rob</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.220" end="00:22:03.500" style="s2">then yeah for other purposes yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.390" end="00:22:06.900" style="s2">the conspiracy theory about friendships</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.500" end="00:22:10.110" style="s2">but I think that just like I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.900" end="00:22:15.440" style="s2">beginning for me being a man it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.110" end="00:22:17.610" style="s2">powerful asset which were not utilizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.440" end="00:22:21.140" style="s2">optimally and that also include</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.610" end="00:22:25.500" style="s2">friendships friendships are also such</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.140" end="00:22:29.490" style="s2">powerful relations assets which we could</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.500" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">also utilize much much better that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.490" end="00:22:33.450" style="s2">of the things I got out of this rite of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:36.780" style="s2">passage that I was doing this rite of</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.450" end="00:22:39.059" style="s2">passage together with so there&#39;s my son</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.780" end="00:22:40.289" style="s2">and seven other boys and seven other</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.059" end="00:22:45.000" style="s2">fathers and then there was some</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.289" end="00:22:46.860" style="s2">assistance for men em and this</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.000" end="00:22:51.059" style="s2">experience of having all these men</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.860" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">helping each other raise these boys was</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.059" end="00:23:00.390" style="s2">just so beautiful and so powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:06.270" style="s2">with and there&#39;s so much potential in</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.390" end="00:23:08.549" style="s2">that then we could utilize yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.270" end="00:23:11.039" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s almost a rediscovery of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.549" end="00:23:13.890" style="s2">of who we are as human beings right</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.039" end="00:23:17.400" style="s2">because that always existed you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.890" end="00:23:19.650" style="s2">yeah and it seems in modernity it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.400" end="00:23:23.159" style="s2">it&#39;s just been sort of destroyed or or</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.650" end="00:23:26.280" style="s2">or turned into pathological forms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.159" end="00:23:27.270" style="s2">itself or you know it&#39;s all many of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.280" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">these things they&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">institutionalized right like so the male</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">friendship has become institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:40.679" style="s2">in the the corporation child care has</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:43.940" style="s2">been institutionalized in the daycare</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.679" end="00:23:46.610" style="s2">facility and and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.940" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">and of course I mean so these</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.610" end="00:23:50.580" style="s2">institutions yes they&#39;re very efficient</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:53.010" style="s2">I mean institutionalized take here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.580" end="00:23:57.960" style="s2">very efficient the corporation very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.010" end="00:24:00.390" style="s2">efficient however mmm something when we</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.960" end="00:24:03.240" style="s2">move our human relations into these</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.390" end="00:24:04.740" style="s2">institutions we also lose something and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.240" end="00:24:07.260" style="s2">I think that&#39;s kind of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.740" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">today we&#39;re kind of in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.260" end="00:24:09.940" style="s2">discovering some of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:12.850" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.940" end="00:24:15.220" style="s2">lost in that transition and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.850" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">and and and and and because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.220" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">institutions are failing us on some</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">massive level I mean not not in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:28.169" style="s2">the society together but in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:35.309" style="s2">providing a meaningful yea existence yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.169" end="00:24:40.360" style="s2">that&#39;s true but I also see a lot of good</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.309" end="00:24:41.710" style="s2">efforts to recreate in new forms some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.360" end="00:24:43.570" style="s2">these things that we&#39;ve kind of lost</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.710" end="00:24:46.770" style="s2">like the thing that where we met at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.570" end="00:24:49.770" style="s2">European men&#39;s gathering is also like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.770" end="00:24:53.049" style="s2">rediscovery and a reinvention of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.770" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">something that used to be there but we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.049" end="00:25:00.130" style="s2">kind of lost and now we&#39;re recreating it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:04.110" style="s2">but in a modern setting right and I see</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.130" end="00:25:04.110" style="s2">a lot of that going on fortunately so</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.010" end="00:25:13.809" style="s2">did you see the film The Joker no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.650" end="00:25:17.950" style="s2">worth seeing because in some on some</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.809" end="00:25:20.190" style="s2">levels for me I was I was watching this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.950" end="00:25:23.740" style="s2">movie and it&#39;s it&#39;s the overgrown man</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.190" end="00:25:25.720" style="s2">whose stays with his mother and doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.740" end="00:25:27.809" style="s2">and that and then the pathology of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.720" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">is there&#39;s a lot of realism to it I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.809" end="00:25:32.530" style="s2">guess I mentioned it just because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:37.419" style="s2">because I was writing about it recently</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.530" end="00:25:40.210" style="s2">and thinking and thinking about how the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.419" end="00:25:42.370" style="s2">postmodern sort of you know this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.210" end="00:25:45.400" style="s2">postmodern leveling of difference the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.370" end="00:25:47.740" style="s2">levelling of the distinctions and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.400" end="00:25:50.830" style="s2">qualities of everything and then and</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.740" end="00:25:56.380" style="s2">then what&#39;s left is a kind of a parody</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.830" end="00:25:57.940" style="s2">of yeah of society and this film was was</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.380" end="00:25:59.530" style="s2">wind it was interesting because it had a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.940" end="00:26:04.990" style="s2">kind of realism to it it kind of killed</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.530" end="00:26:06.789" style="s2">this whole superhero myths of good and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.990" end="00:26:10.120" style="s2">evil you know it kind of was destroying</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.789" end="00:26:13.059" style="s2">this kind of you know pseudo mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.120" end="00:26:14.890" style="s2">of the superhero myths where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.059" end="00:26:16.750" style="s2">always going to be saved by by this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.890" end="00:26:20.070" style="s2">that person and then you saw this person</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.750" end="00:26:22.929" style="s2">who was actually real you know and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.070" end="00:26:23.530" style="s2">how that relates to what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.929" end="00:26:25.450" style="s2">about in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.530" end="00:26:28.090" style="s2">well I think I think there&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.450" end="00:26:32.770" style="s2">caricature of masculinity that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.090" end="00:26:35.380" style="s2">kind of like ya know that caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.770" end="00:26:37.510" style="s2">all the roles in in fact and art you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.380" end="00:26:39.640" style="s2">know and and which you know because of I</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.510" end="00:26:46.480" style="s2">guess because of Hollywood you know and</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.640" end="00:26:48.670" style="s2">and and you know what all of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.480" end="00:26:50.770" style="s2">all in an entertainment industry and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.670" end="00:26:52.390" style="s2">so we have this caricature of view of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.770" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">what does a man what is a woman and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.390" end="00:26:56.140" style="s2">is a person and what is a where is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:57.910" style="s2">actually something Dee all these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.140" end="00:27:02.590" style="s2">that need to we need to find out the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.910" end="00:27:04.600" style="s2">deeper and complex nature yeah so so on</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.590" end="00:27:06.270" style="s2">the so that&#39;s very true I think on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.600" end="00:27:09.280" style="s2">one hand yeah it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.270" end="00:27:11.890" style="s2">there&#39;s some tendencies for an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.280" end="00:27:14.530" style="s2">to level the differences or neglect or</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.890" end="00:27:16.630" style="s2">annihilate the differences between men</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.530" end="00:27:19.390" style="s2">and women but there&#39;s also attempts to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.630" end="00:27:21.190" style="s2">annihilate and that&#39;s maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.390" end="00:27:29.140" style="s2">problematic the differences between boys</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.190" end="00:27:31.420" style="s2">and men yeah and the Joker is that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.140" end="00:27:34.420" style="s2">person who who never grows up who never</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.420" end="00:27:36.970" style="s2">goes through that particular stage so he</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.420" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">remains always in a kind of infantile</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.970" end="00:27:45.070" style="s2">state and I think this is I think this</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.120" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">is kind of a plague especially in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.070" end="00:27:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not the right word plague oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah very very wide widespread</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.560" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">is this is this man boy who never takes</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.570" end="00:28:00.610" style="s2">responsibility he has all the freedoms</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:02.470" style="s2">in the world right as all that he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.610" end="00:28:05.200" style="s2">all the technology in the world he has</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.470" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">all the gizmos and toys in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.200" end="00:28:10.510" style="s2">he never quite grows and grows up and</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">like in the Jordan Peter Sounion said</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.510" end="00:28:15.130" style="s2">takes responsibility right he remains</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.000" end="00:28:17.680" style="s2">this kind of clown of caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.130" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">himself and I think I mean that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.680" end="00:28:25.780" style="s2">a that it&#39;s there&#39;s a tendency for us to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:30.160" style="s2">weigh in a culture to speak badly about</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.780" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">min and being a man was we so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.160" end="00:28:35.620" style="s2">always like him twice not always but</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.980" end="00:28:36.809" style="s2">it&#39;s often sort of us associated with to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.620" end="00:28:39.809" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.809" end="00:28:42.120" style="s2">suspicious or ridiculous or something</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.809" end="00:28:44.730" style="s2">else being a man and and what that does</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.120" end="00:28:47.070" style="s2">is that when we talk about being a man</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.730" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">in those terms what we&#39;re telling boys</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.070" end="00:28:53.549" style="s2">is that don&#39;t aspire to become a main</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">don&#39;t aspire to become a man because</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.549" end="00:28:59.309" style="s2">it&#39;s just ridiculous or it&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:29:02.549" style="s2">or suspicious or whatever it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.309" end="00:29:07.230" style="s2">toxic yeah exactly and we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.549" end="00:29:09.990" style="s2">everyone the boys the women everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.230" end="00:29:12.749" style="s2">we&#39;re doing everyone a disservice by</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.990" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">doing this nothing good comes with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.749" end="00:29:17.070" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new mention John</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.690" end="00:29:19.590" style="s2">Peters and so there&#39;s a there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.070" end="00:29:23.820" style="s2">phrase or one towards the end of his</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.590" end="00:29:27.990" style="s2">book tour rules where he says if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.820" end="00:29:30.119" style="s2">afraid of strong men you haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.990" end="00:29:32.519" style="s2">what weak men can do something along</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.389" end="00:30:40.440" style="s2">the more the men get the less the women</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.519" end="00:30:43.049" style="s2">get so the more we can take from the men</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.440" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">the more the women will get that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.049" end="00:30:48.869" style="s2">absurd way of thinking and and what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:50.309" style="s2">experienced through my men&#39;s work and</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.299" end="00:31:03.979" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s complementarity rather</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.609" end="00:31:07.739" style="s2">than opposition right so so strong men</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.979" end="00:31:11.999" style="s2">good men it just benefits everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.739" end="00:31:14.729" style="s2">including cut the women and the children</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.999" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">of course also so this yeah it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.729" end="00:31:20.729" style="s2">these kinds of good things about men and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.940" end="00:31:28.259" style="s2">strong men so we should yeah do what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.729" end="00:31:30.299" style="s2">can to encourage this okay so you told</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.259" end="00:31:31.919" style="s2">me you&#39;re writing a book about something</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.299" end="00:31:34.979" style="s2">to do with Heidegger and-and-and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.919" end="00:31:38.099" style="s2">Peterson well comparing the two or</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.979" end="00:31:39.989" style="s2">talking about Heidegger and maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.099" end="00:31:41.879" style="s2">not it well what happened was I started</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.989" end="00:31:43.739" style="s2">writing a book about Jordan Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.879" end="00:31:46.589" style="s2">then when I was forty pages into it I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.739" end="00:31:47.909" style="s2">was like why am i what is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.589" end="00:31:49.469" style="s2">potentially about I mean he&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.909" end="00:31:51.509" style="s2">his own book and he&#39;s still alive and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.469" end="00:31:53.249" style="s2">he&#39;s known for himself does he really</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.509" end="00:31:57.659" style="s2">need me to say something about him and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.249" end="00:32:00.149" style="s2">then also I was I kind of came to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.659" end="00:32:01.499" style="s2">realization that what interested me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.149" end="00:32:05.609" style="s2">not really interested in Jordan B</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.499" end="00:32:09.690" style="s2">Peterson himself I&#39;m interested in men</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.609" end="00:32:11.580" style="s2">yeah but particularly men so I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.690" end="00:32:13.559" style="s2">skipped that manuscript and then started</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.580" end="00:32:15.859" style="s2">a new one where I wanted to raise this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.559" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">question what does it mean to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.859" end="00:32:26.999" style="s2">and then yeah and then my plan was to</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.799" end="00:32:30.419" style="s2">sort of include different thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.999" end="00:32:32.789" style="s2">that actually I mean I know I actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.419" end="00:32:35.489" style="s2">came across some of your writings before</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.789" end="00:32:38.789" style="s2">we met and I did because I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.489" end="00:32:40.529" style="s2">that you you had like this you also like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.789" end="00:32:44.279" style="s2">see shake and you also like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.529" end="00:32:45.869" style="s2">Peterson and I&#39;ve also I mean I also</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.279" end="00:32:48.659" style="s2">like she&#39;s she coy</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.869" end="00:32:50.909" style="s2">yeah I still like him but I several of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.659" end="00:32:52.979" style="s2">my books have I&#39;ve used his work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.909" end="00:32:54.809" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very inspired by their so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.979" end="00:32:57.149" style="s2">also tried using some sheet on this but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.809" end="00:32:59.700" style="s2">it didn&#39;t really work and then so I went</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.149" end="00:33:03.589" style="s2">my my default position whenever I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.700" end="00:33:03.589" style="s2">know what to do I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">and then I I started yeah just building</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.560" end="00:33:14.760" style="s2">on on silent side and his ideas and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">I have really moved further than that so</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.760" end="00:33:21.120" style="s2">now it&#39;s become like this book about</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:24.300" style="s2">being a main using Heidegger so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:26.310" style="s2">lot of my man and Heidegger and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.300" end="00:33:30.750" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of it when I&#39;m in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.310" end="00:33:32.550" style="s2">of it now so I&#39;m not really so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.750" end="00:33:34.260" style="s2">probably means you will be attacked at</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.550" end="00:33:37.410" style="s2">some point for being a Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.260" end="00:33:41.910" style="s2">I think that&#39;s happening already it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.410" end="00:33:43.710" style="s2">already happening I was involved in I</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.910" end="00:33:48.350" style="s2">wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t television a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.710" end="00:33:53.360" style="s2">weeks ago on this issue of equality and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.350" end="00:33:57.830" style="s2">I mean I know this I mean some people a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.360" end="00:34:05.940" style="s2">is so hiding he has this phrase he says</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.830" end="00:34:08.909" style="s2">being has the nature of yay - kite - so</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.940" end="00:34:11.970" style="s2">it means that being is always I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.909" end="00:34:14.490" style="s2">it&#39;s always mine or I can&#39;t talk of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.970" end="00:34:18.120" style="s2">being sort of in an abstract way because</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.490" end="00:34:20.429" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mine it&#39;s kind of part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.120" end="00:34:23.820" style="s2">who I am and I think that also applies</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:26.880" style="s2">to being a man or being a woman is</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.820" end="00:34:28.590" style="s2">something very very very intimate right</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.880" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s interesting it seems</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.590" end="00:34:32.250" style="s2">like you&#39;re resisting definitions here</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.250" end="00:34:36.929" style="s2">very important but you&#39;re resisting some</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:39.840" style="s2">kind of ultimate definition of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.929" end="00:34:41.460" style="s2">thing yeah which is I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.840" end="00:34:42.870" style="s2">what hi I mean what kind of I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.460" end="00:34:45.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what I learned from Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.870" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">that is it a you know thinking is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.600" end="00:34:49.980" style="s2">just being stuck in one cut in one</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:51.899" style="s2">conceptual world it&#39;s sort of revealing</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.980" end="00:34:53.310" style="s2">and unraveling the meanings of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.899" end="00:34:58.290" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s kind of an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.310" end="00:34:58.740" style="s2">process with with no end so um does that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.290" end="00:35:02.370" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.740" end="00:35:04.220" style="s2">and now I&#39;m thinking oh no my book maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.370" end="00:35:07.110" style="s2">it&#39;s never gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.220" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">no but that&#39;s the right that&#39;s your book</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.110" end="00:35:10.860" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t it shouldn&#39;t have an ending it</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.900" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be like it shouldn&#39;t be an</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.860" end="00:35:15.550" style="s2">absolute statement it should be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.900" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">provoking of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.550" end="00:35:18.780" style="s2">of more truth right</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.000" end="00:35:26.470" style="s2">and I mean you before you asked me sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.630" end="00:35:29.020" style="s2">of how was why why did this quest of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.470" end="00:35:31.030" style="s2">being a man why has that become relevant</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.020" end="00:35:33.130" style="s2">to me and I told the story about my son</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.030" end="00:35:34.600" style="s2">and divorce and all this but I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.130" end="00:35:39.570" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing is that I&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.600" end="00:35:44.740" style="s2">studied sociology in this in the 90s and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.570" end="00:35:49.120" style="s2">I think they discovered that none of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.740" end="00:35:52.660" style="s2">what I read in sociology about men and</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.120" end="00:35:55.780" style="s2">women was of any use to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.660" end="00:35:57.670" style="s2">in terms of figuring out my own life nor</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.780" end="00:36:01.630" style="s2">the opposite it was just confusing or</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.670" end="00:36:06.820" style="s2">misleading me and I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.630" end="00:36:08.320" style="s2">there&#39;s actually very few resources in</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.820" end="00:36:09.370" style="s2">philosophy terms of thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.320" end="00:36:12.130" style="s2">it means to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.370" end="00:36:16.170" style="s2">have you read read Yvonne Alicia&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.130" end="00:36:19.660" style="s2">do you know Yvonne image Yvonne Ilic</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.170" end="00:36:21.670" style="s2">Yvonne Ilitch yeah he wrote a book he</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.660" end="00:36:23.800" style="s2">actually he actually wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.670" end="00:36:26.590" style="s2">gender and then and then this was</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.800" end="00:36:29.110" style="s2">hijacked this term was hijacked probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.590" end="00:36:30.760" style="s2">it was him who brought it into vogue but</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.110" end="00:36:34.290" style="s2">it&#39;s the most interesting book I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.760" end="00:36:36.700" style="s2">read on you know men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.290" end="00:36:40.450" style="s2">commentary and although maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.700" end="00:36:42.970" style="s2">check that book it&#39;s from I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.450" end="00:36:44.770" style="s2">it was published in 1980 yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.970" end="00:36:46.570" style="s2">think my friend he talks about this</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.770" end="00:36:48.490" style="s2">sometimes but I haven&#39;t done round 2 and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.570" end="00:36:50.260" style="s2">I&#39;m sitting here oh that&#39;s nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.490" end="00:36:51.310" style="s2">philosophy there&#39;s nothing so and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.260" end="00:36:52.630" style="s2">there&#39;s all these books that I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.310" end="00:36:54.580" style="s2">read so maybe I should be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.630" end="00:36:56.770" style="s2">more careful but at least I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.580" end="00:36:58.660" style="s2">didn&#39;t it was it was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.770" end="00:37:01.150" style="s2">curriculum that I was introduced to it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.660" end="00:37:02.980" style="s2">just didn&#39;t helped me I mean and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.150" end="00:37:04.450" style="s2">it&#39;s that&#39;s still to last I think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.980" end="00:37:07.330" style="s2">is one of the reasons why Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.450" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">Pederson has become so popular yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.330" end="00:37:11.770" style="s2">because he&#39;s he&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:14.650" style="s2">beginnings or the sketch or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.770" end="00:37:16.840" style="s2">introduction to a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.650" end="00:37:18.550" style="s2">what it means to be a man which does not</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.840" end="00:37:21.430" style="s2">start from the premise that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.550" end="00:37:23.470" style="s2">oh yeah men are bad and they&#39;re just out</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.430" end="00:37:25.870" style="s2">to exploit women and all this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.470" end="00:37:28.869" style="s2">stuff but it kind of it really starts</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.870" end="00:37:32.079" style="s2">from a positive starting</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.869" end="00:37:38.680" style="s2">saying men generous they want to help</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.079" end="00:37:40.749" style="s2">women and Gianna stuff yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.680" end="00:37:44.680" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an introduction I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.749" end="00:37:47.650" style="s2">you&#39;re right and also I think that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.680" end="00:37:52.359" style="s2">kind of like he&#39;s kind of the only</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.650" end="00:37:54.609" style="s2">person out there who is valorizes that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.359" end="00:37:57.779" style="s2">and in a relentless sort of way and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.609" end="00:38:00.490" style="s2">keeps going by low-rises the you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.779" end="00:38:04.029" style="s2">the value of men and keeps talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.490" end="00:38:06.910" style="s2">it I think even more like like like more</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.029" end="00:38:10.509" style="s2">like intellectual people that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.910" end="00:38:13.900" style="s2">seems quaint or something to them or get</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.509" end="00:38:17.230" style="s2">but and so they miss the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.900" end="00:38:18.460" style="s2">that I uh wonder if it comes from is</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.230" end="00:38:21.249" style="s2">sort of working-class you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.460" end="00:38:24.249" style="s2">background and really understanding you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.249" end="00:38:28.509" style="s2">know the kind of toughness of my more</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.249" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">primal life and and I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.509" end="00:38:35.109" style="s2">makes no that makes it there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:37.900" style="s2">I noticed in so in the in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.109" end="00:38:39.640" style="s2">Kathy Newman interview there was and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.900" end="00:38:44.789" style="s2">was right at the beginning so she asks</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.640" end="00:38:49.029" style="s2">him something along the lines of all</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.789" end="00:38:52.089" style="s2">your most of your audience is male yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.029" end="00:38:54.009" style="s2">most of them are men and then he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.089" end="00:38:56.140" style="s2">you kind of deflects that or he&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.009" end="00:38:59.470" style="s2">ants as well yeah but it&#39;s just because</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.140" end="00:39:02.950" style="s2">it&#39;s YouTube and tumblr is for girls</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.470" end="00:39:04.690" style="s2">something like that and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.950" end="00:39:09.609" style="s2">this sense that he wants to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.690" end="00:39:11.589" style="s2">avoid or mmm he kind of deflects this</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.609" end="00:39:12.670" style="s2">question there but then I&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.589" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">later interviews</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.670" end="00:39:18.849" style="s2">it&#39;s like he&#39;s he kind of discovers okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:22.299" style="s2">why is it that why is it that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.849" end="00:39:25.539" style="s2">even a bad thing there&#39;s so many or boys</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.299" end="00:39:27.519" style="s2">or young men and why should i why should</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.539" end="00:39:29.049" style="s2">he be apologizing for that in any way I</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.519" end="00:39:29.799" style="s2">mean I there&#39;s no reason to apologize</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.049" end="00:39:32.410" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.799" end="00:39:35.739" style="s2">I remember seeing later interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.410" end="00:39:38.890" style="s2">him where he&#39;s where he kind of M just</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.739" end="00:39:42.260" style="s2">chase it more as a like a positive</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.890" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">quantity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.260" end="00:39:46.850" style="s2">to them yeah because in young men are</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:49.010" style="s2">important and they have all this</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.850" end="00:39:52.640" style="s2">virility and they you know they they</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.010" end="00:39:55.490" style="s2">help build the world and we have to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.640" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s plenty of people speaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.490" end="00:40:01.070" style="s2">for I mean if you&#39;re a woman I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">you want to know about Wendy&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.070" end="00:40:05.630" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more stuff on that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:07.070" style="s2">then and it doesn&#39;t start from then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.630" end="00:40:08.150" style="s2">can debate whether that&#39;s good I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.070" end="00:40:10.340" style="s2">know that because I&#39;m not a woman</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.150" end="00:40:11.630" style="s2">perhaps it makes sense for the women</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.340" end="00:40:13.550" style="s2">whatever us out there already who</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.630" end="00:40:15.859" style="s2">feminism what-have-you gender theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.550" end="00:40:18.230" style="s2">maybe it makes sense for them and if it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.859" end="00:40:20.330" style="s2">does that&#39;s all well and good go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.230" end="00:40:22.910" style="s2">yeah but I could just for myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.330" end="00:40:25.130" style="s2">man it doesn&#39;t make sense to me it does</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.910" end="00:40:27.859" style="s2">yeah well I was thinking about this and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.130" end="00:40:31.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be anti-feminist at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.859" end="00:40:33.800" style="s2">I want to be pro feminist but I also</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.250" end="00:40:36.380" style="s2">want to be masculinist like I think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.800" end="00:40:40.310" style="s2">pitcher has to be has to be balanced you</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.380" end="00:40:42.500" style="s2">know III think we can criticize feminism</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.310" end="00:40:44.930" style="s2">in a lot of ways and then there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.500" end="00:40:46.820" style="s2">feminists who are more interesting than</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.930" end="00:40:49.490" style="s2">others and and we don&#39;t want to go there</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.820" end="00:40:52.460" style="s2">particularly particularly but but but</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.490" end="00:40:56.630" style="s2">but but if there&#39;s feminism there has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.460" end="00:41:00.890" style="s2">be masculinism as well I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.630" end="00:41:02.900" style="s2">yeah what if it&#39;s like this and I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.890" end="00:41:06.859" style="s2">throwing that out there what if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.900" end="00:41:09.290" style="s2">like this for women or for some women it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.859" end="00:41:12.380" style="s2">makes sense to make sense of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.290" end="00:41:14.780" style="s2">from the perspective of feminism which</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.380" end="00:41:18.050" style="s2">is like taking one side maybe that makes</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.780" end="00:41:20.060" style="s2">sense to them but what if it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.050" end="00:41:20.440" style="s2">that for men that just doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.060" end="00:41:27.619" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.440" end="00:41:30.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not part of our like part of being</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.619" end="00:41:32.750" style="s2">a man is protecting a part of being a</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.230" end="00:41:35.750" style="s2">man is putting women and children before</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.750" end="00:41:38.990" style="s2">yourself if that&#39;s part of being a man</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.750" end="00:41:42.980" style="s2">then even masculinism wouldn&#39;t even make</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.990" end="00:41:45.170" style="s2">sense I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.980" end="00:41:47.359" style="s2">do know that for me feminine I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.170" end="00:41:48.410" style="s2">it makes sense to some people fine go</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.359" end="00:41:50.690" style="s2">ahead do it</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.410" end="00:41:55.040" style="s2">well I guess what I mean by masculism is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.690" end="00:41:55.970" style="s2">just revalorisé &#39;uncle inity and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.040" end="00:41:59.840" style="s2">maleness and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.970" end="00:42:02.540" style="s2">just as as feminism you know at least an</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.840" end="00:42:05.780" style="s2">intention is trying to value the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.540" end="00:42:08.390" style="s2">you know the woman is a value right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.780" end="00:42:15.050" style="s2">so we&#39;re saying the women is a value and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.390" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">the men is also a value but but I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.050" end="00:42:20.750" style="s2">know what but this there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:25.940" style="s2">something in it in that I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.750" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s for me to and I and I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.940" end="00:42:29.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not what you&#39;re saying but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:33.250" style="s2">one could kind of say oh now we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.420" end="00:42:36.200" style="s2">feminism that has kind of like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.250" end="00:42:39.380" style="s2">overvalued off I don&#39;t think can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.200" end="00:42:42.080" style="s2">overvalued but at least sort of put put</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.380" end="00:42:44.630" style="s2">feminists or the feminine sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.080" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">pedestal or whatever they&#39;ve done so now</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.630" end="00:42:49.610" style="s2">we need something to counterbalance that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:50.030" style="s2">hmm I&#39;m not sure they ever got a balance</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.610" end="00:42:52.160" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.030" end="00:42:57.650" style="s2">I think we need to find another maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.160" end="00:43:01.010" style="s2">that still rival recen in a sense and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.650" end="00:43:03.940" style="s2">again it doesn&#39;t there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.010" end="00:43:09.910" style="s2">reason why this feminism and masculinism</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.940" end="00:43:15.380" style="s2">it is because the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.910" end="00:43:17.750" style="s2">valorising mmm the masculine over the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.380" end="00:43:20.030" style="s2">feminine it&#39;s just not a very masculine</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.750" end="00:43:22.130" style="s2">thing to do it so I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.030" end="00:43:23.840" style="s2">things when out the first European Minsk</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.130" end="00:43:25.940" style="s2">and also the second one but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.840" end="00:43:30.200" style="s2">things that struck me at the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.940" end="00:43:33.970" style="s2">Europeans gathering was we were 140 men</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.200" end="00:43:36.560" style="s2">we were together for a whole weekend not</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.970" end="00:43:41.210" style="s2">one single time</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.560" end="00:43:45.430" style="s2">did I hear anyone say anything negative</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.210" end="00:43:45.430" style="s2">about women not once</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.130" end="00:43:50.420" style="s2">I was just so happy about that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.260" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">interesting yeah yeah I could see that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.420" end="00:43:55.810" style="s2">in my mind my parents actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:55.810" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.080" end="00:44:01.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve never heard my father speak ill of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.780" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">my mother right after their divorce he</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.720" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">just did not in fact he wouldn&#39;t be more</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:12.100" style="s2">likely say sort of positive things about</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:15.130" style="s2">her and and and I never heard - as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.100" end="00:44:16.410" style="s2">young person I I heard negative things</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.130" end="00:44:18.520" style="s2">about my father</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.410" end="00:44:21.190" style="s2">relentlessly right and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.520" end="00:44:23.170" style="s2">boys do your negative things about their</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.170" end="00:44:30.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not saying my father was any kind</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.070" end="00:44:36.540" style="s2">but but but but that seemed to be just</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.250" end="00:44:39.070" style="s2">normal right it seemed to be normal that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.540" end="00:44:41.620" style="s2">the you one should speak very badly</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.070" end="00:44:44.380" style="s2">about about about the the the the guy</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.620" end="00:44:48.370" style="s2">who had had failed and was a loser and</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.370" end="00:44:52.540" style="s2">the same thing for a women and why</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.200" end="00:44:54.940" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t he speak about about maybe out</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.540" end="00:44:57.850" style="s2">of fear I don&#39;t know maybe I know I</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.830" end="00:45:07.210" style="s2">because he&#39;s a man period and also</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.220" end="00:45:09.870" style="s2">another thing is no one wants to listen</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.210" end="00:45:12.370" style="s2">to a man who speaks badly about women</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.870" end="00:45:16.570" style="s2">mm-hmm women certainly don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.370" end="00:45:19.060" style="s2">hear about it but even more other men we</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.570" end="00:45:22.930" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t like to hear it</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.060" end="00:45:24.700" style="s2">oh we just yeah yeah and that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.930" end="00:45:26.650" style="s2">off that is like the worst kind of man</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.700" end="00:45:27.900" style="s2">isn&#39;t the guy who&#39;s just complaining</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.650" end="00:45:30.850" style="s2">about women all the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.900" end="00:45:32.950" style="s2">there&#39;s something very unmasculine about</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.850" end="00:45:38.920" style="s2">it yes or something I think it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.950" end="00:45:43.420" style="s2">another thing is that we also men we</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.920" end="00:45:46.510" style="s2">don&#39;t we also don&#39;t want to identify as</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.420" end="00:45:48.490" style="s2">victims and there&#39;s something like if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.510" end="00:45:49.930" style="s2">when you talk bad about women and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.490" end="00:45:51.880" style="s2">you&#39;re also putting yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.930" end="00:45:54.340" style="s2">position of being a victim and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.880" end="00:45:57.940" style="s2">also not a very masculine thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.340" end="00:46:00.190" style="s2">yeah mmm I think it&#39;s I mean I have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.940" end="00:46:03.070" style="s2">be carefully buddy just looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.190" end="00:46:06.180" style="s2">empirically on what happens under the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.070" end="00:46:08.830" style="s2">headline of feminism there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.180" end="00:46:10.080" style="s2">taking the position of the victim and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.830" end="00:46:12.960" style="s2">there is a lot of talking</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.080" end="00:46:15.870" style="s2">about me I just have to I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.960" end="00:46:18.720" style="s2">what I that&#39;s that&#39;s what even Alice</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.870" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">says in his book it&#39;s like the power of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.720" end="00:46:24.840" style="s2">women&#39;s gossip is actually there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:26.460" style="s2">sacred quality to that and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.840" end="00:46:28.560" style="s2">just talking about other people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.460" end="00:46:30.570" style="s2">that&#39;s how you you know decide who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.560" end="00:46:33.330" style="s2">worthy and not worthy and the community</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.570" end="00:46:35.460" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.330" end="00:46:38.670" style="s2">there&#39;s some sort of and that that has</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.460" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">some sort of a function I&#39;m sure that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.670" end="00:46:43.980" style="s2">there&#39;s a purpose for it I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:45.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a purpose for this and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.980" end="00:46:51.360" style="s2">not you&#39;re not just complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.330" end="00:46:53.580" style="s2">women here that&#39;s not weird I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.360" end="00:46:55.260" style="s2">that function is always being performed</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.580" end="00:46:57.480" style="s2">in the best way but I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.260" end="00:46:59.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a primordial function in that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.480" end="00:47:02.040" style="s2">otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be there I&#39;m much</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.400" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">of a social function with sociology I am</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.040" end="00:47:09.210" style="s2">so so so therefore I also don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:11.190" style="s2">problem with women or women getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.210" end="00:47:13.890" style="s2">together and talking bad about their men</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.190" end="00:47:16.080" style="s2">or I&#39;ve absolutely no problem with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.890" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">they can do that all day long if they</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.080" end="00:47:24.380" style="s2">want to however I don&#39;t want to be I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:27.180" style="s2">mean if I&#39;m around men and they I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.380" end="00:47:30.360" style="s2">mm-hmm if they start talking bad about</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.180" end="00:47:34.170" style="s2">women it just there&#39;s no energy in it it</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.360" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">I just yeah I don&#39;t like it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.170" end="00:47:45.020" style="s2">that&#39;s very dangerous to our culture so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:48.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like then it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.020" end="00:47:52.410" style="s2">Achilles I don&#39;t really it is also the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.930" end="00:47:53.690" style="s2">problem of the I was gonna say the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.410" end="00:47:59.640" style="s2">movement but there isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.690" end="00:48:01.770" style="s2">amendment because I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.640" end="00:48:03.980" style="s2">to have a it&#39;s all it&#39;s easier to have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.770" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">movement it if you can sort of identify</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.980" end="00:48:08.970" style="s2">around some sort of victim boots over</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:11.070" style="s2">all victims this form a movement yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.970" end="00:48:13.350" style="s2">let&#39;s do that blah blah blah and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.070" end="00:48:15.690" style="s2">you can form a movement but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.350" end="00:48:17.910" style="s2">very difficult to mobilize men around it</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.690" end="00:48:23.730" style="s2">because men we don&#39;t like to mow cuts</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.910" end="00:48:25.829" style="s2">around victimhood so mmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.730" end="00:48:30.119" style="s2">but at the same time obviously there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.829" end="00:48:32.190" style="s2">problems in society in relations between</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.119" end="00:48:35.430" style="s2">men and women like for instance like</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.190" end="00:48:37.380" style="s2">divorce legal arrangement around in for</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.430" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">sister where there&#39;s huge problems with</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.380" end="00:48:41.160" style="s2">that have to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.150" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a different it&#39;s so difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.160" end="00:48:47.900" style="s2">mobilize people men around these issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:52.260" style="s2">because yeah what is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.900" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">identifying within yeah so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.260" end="00:48:55.980" style="s2">but so you don&#39;t think that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:57.690" style="s2">think that it could be a credible men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.980" end="00:49:00.150" style="s2">movement in the same way there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.690" end="00:49:02.670" style="s2">a women&#39;s movement you know in the 70</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.150" end="00:49:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not a question of credibility it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.670" end="00:49:09.030" style="s2">not a person it is question of what</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.560" end="00:49:11.930" style="s2">marketing or or no it&#39;d be a big it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.030" end="00:49:15.420" style="s2">question of getting enough men together</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.930" end="00:49:22.320" style="s2">I have a powerful movement I think I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.420" end="00:49:27.000" style="s2">think I think I don&#39;t know I think the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.320" end="00:49:31.079" style="s2">there was only in order to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.000" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">problems around the legal system around</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.079" end="00:49:36.630" style="s2">divorces I mean I&#39;m talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:40.410" style="s2">because for me that&#39;s the main problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.630" end="00:49:43.770" style="s2">for all the main sort of political</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.410" end="00:49:46.410" style="s2">problem for men today has to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.770" end="00:49:48.540" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible and it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.410" end="00:49:50.609" style="s2">everywhere especially terrible it did</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.540" end="00:49:52.470" style="s2">mark and I&#39;ve been involved in it this</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.609" end="00:49:57.300" style="s2">works so I also know something about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.470" end="00:49:59.670" style="s2">um and I&#39;ve seen I mean the work on this</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.300" end="00:50:03.480" style="s2">has been going on for at least 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.670" end="00:50:07.400" style="s2">and I will stay very little if any</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.480" end="00:50:07.400" style="s2">progress has been made in those 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.490" end="00:50:14.390" style="s2">and but I and I think what I think those</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.750" end="00:51:59.100" style="s2">oh sure well you know I&#39;m not an expert</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:03.600" style="s2">of Jeezy I just spread like three of his</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.100" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">books for for fun I never wrote about</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.600" end="00:52:08.550" style="s2">him or thought about him that much as</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:11.480" style="s2">much as Jordan Peterson but he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.550" end="00:52:14.670" style="s2">interesting person to contemplate yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.480" end="00:52:17.550" style="s2">really enjoyed the I found that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.670" end="00:52:19.470" style="s2">interaction between or the the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.550" end="00:52:21.990" style="s2">or whatever the conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.470" end="00:52:26.760" style="s2">jiseok and Jordan Peterson I really find</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.990" end="00:52:29.820" style="s2">that found that interesting yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.760" end="00:52:32.220" style="s2">think I think mmm interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.820" end="00:52:34.290" style="s2">they have such different approaches and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.220" end="00:52:35.780" style="s2">ways of thinking you know Peterson was</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.290" end="00:52:39.840" style="s2">sort of coming in there with his like</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.780" end="00:52:44.860" style="s2">you know all of his like fierce you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.840" end="00:52:47.120" style="s2">and energy and and Zizi Zack was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.860" end="00:52:51.560" style="s2">deflecting all that you know or</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.120" end="00:52:53.420" style="s2">something what for me what the most I</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.560" end="00:52:57.050" style="s2">was really happy about it not so much</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.420" end="00:52:59.810" style="s2">because of whatever insights came out of</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.050" end="00:53:01.150" style="s2">it but more because they actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.810" end="00:53:04.100" style="s2">listened to each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.150" end="00:53:08.600" style="s2">mm-hmm right they actually listened to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.100" end="00:53:12.890" style="s2">each other and so what I found was that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.600" end="00:53:16.370" style="s2">it was really AM it was it was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.890" end="00:53:18.020" style="s2">civilized intellectual conversation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.370" end="00:53:22.190" style="s2">and no hysteria</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.020" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">there was no yeah and I really like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.190" end="00:53:31.700" style="s2">I think a lot of people were especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2">perhaps on the Cystic side because they</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.700" end="00:53:34.490" style="s2">kind of wanted this dogfight or</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:37.070" style="s2">something and they didn&#39;t get it they</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.490" end="00:53:39.640" style="s2">did not yeah that was what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.070" end="00:53:42.410" style="s2">was it was sort of built up to be this</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.640" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">this battle of some kind and then the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.410" end="00:53:48.370" style="s2">battle never happened and it just ended</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:54.530" style="s2">up to people talking and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.370" end="00:53:56.690" style="s2">that for me that&#39;s another one and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.530" end="00:53:58.970" style="s2">perhaps an even greater contribution of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.690" end="00:54:01.070" style="s2">Jordan Pederson is that I see what what</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.970" end="00:54:03.050" style="s2">what he&#39;s brought to the table which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.070" end="00:54:08.060" style="s2">what he&#39;s brought into the elec</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.050" end="00:54:11.390" style="s2">intellectual environment it is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.060" end="00:54:13.610" style="s2">as if he&#39;s kind of rediscovered or</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.390" end="00:54:17.810" style="s2">through him we&#39;re rediscovering the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.610" end="00:54:21.710" style="s2">intellectual conversation when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.810" end="00:54:24.250" style="s2">where I a lot of what I&#39;ve experienced</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.710" end="00:54:25.820" style="s2">not among my colleagues but sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.250" end="00:54:28.730" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.820" end="00:54:31.100" style="s2">I think that&#39;s it at university there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.730" end="00:54:34.400" style="s2">too little we tend to just we talk to</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.100" end="00:54:35.810" style="s2">people that we agree with and then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.400" end="00:54:38.030" style="s2">ones we don&#39;t agree with are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.810" end="00:54:39.830" style="s2">they&#39;re from a paradigm we sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.030" end="00:54:41.510" style="s2">up a straw man of them and then we</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.830" end="00:54:43.630" style="s2">discuss with that among ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.510" end="00:54:46.310" style="s2">they do the same thing yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.630" end="00:54:47.960" style="s2">mmm well I guess I guess that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.310" end="00:54:50.090" style="s2">powerful about policies that can</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.960" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">Peterson as they&#39;ve brought these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.090" end="00:54:57.240" style="s2">down from the ivory tower in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:55:02.079" style="s2">and especially Peterson yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.240" end="00:55:04.930" style="s2">yeah made it sort of made people into</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.079" end="00:55:06.460" style="s2">intellectually curious in ways that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.930" end="00:55:08.140" style="s2">weren&#39;t before and and and people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.460" end="00:55:11.920" style="s2">are not necessarily intellectuals you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.140" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">know by Nature yeah no no that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.920" end="00:55:17.829" style="s2">yes I mean yeah and that&#39;s what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:20.170" style="s2">out and then you can just have I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.829" end="00:55:23.320" style="s2">you just have people talking and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.170" end="00:55:24.849" style="s2">listening to each other then then</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.320" end="00:55:28.540" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s also an audience for</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.849" end="00:55:30.220" style="s2">that because people are just like people</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.540" end="00:55:31.990" style="s2">are hungry for men&#39;s work there was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.220" end="00:55:33.720" style="s2">hunger for this they&#39;re just hungry</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.990" end="00:55:36.820" style="s2">they&#39;re hungry for uncensored</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.720" end="00:55:38.410" style="s2">conversation and in a way that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.820" end="00:55:40.359" style="s2">all so civilized it&#39;s a nice balance</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.410" end="00:55:41.790" style="s2">between you know what where you should</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.359" end="00:55:43.030" style="s2">theoretically be able to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.790" end="00:55:45.190" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.030" end="00:55:48.579" style="s2">in a free society and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.190" end="00:55:52.270" style="s2">anything and you know yeah but but there</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.579" end="00:55:54.250" style="s2">is there is this intense sort of I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.270" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">in the millennial generation especially</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.250" end="00:56:01.569" style="s2">the younger people there&#39;s this intense</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:56:05.579" style="s2">kind of yeah this this political</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.569" end="00:56:07.930" style="s2">correctness or fear of being you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.579" end="00:56:10.300" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like you have to find a</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.930" end="00:56:13.660" style="s2">scapegoat somewhere and and and attack</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.300" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">it and and and not that distracts from</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.660" end="00:56:20.589" style="s2">the entire possibility of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:24.849" style="s2">conversation where you&#39;re learning and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.589" end="00:56:27.579" style="s2">growing together I think I think I like</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.849" end="00:56:34.020" style="s2">my I guess my students are would be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.579" end="00:56:34.020" style="s2">millennial generation and what I</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.770" end="00:56:39.550" style="s2">experienced with my students and I agree</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.930" end="00:56:41.410" style="s2">with yesterday&#39;s what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.550" end="00:56:44.740" style="s2">about this you know our culture in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.410" end="00:56:48.430" style="s2">time here but I also sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.740" end="00:56:54.869" style="s2">a lot of the opposites yeah me too yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.430" end="00:56:57.400" style="s2">yeah I I experienced so many students of</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.869" end="00:56:58.930" style="s2">generation that I&#39;m teaching now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.400" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">so fed up with that and they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.930" end="00:57:04.740" style="s2">hungry for these big questions and these</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">big discussions about these potentially</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.740" end="00:57:10.609" style="s2">controversial issues and they all for</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:12.950" style="s2">freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.609" end="00:57:16.880" style="s2">freedom of thinking and just as recently</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.950" end="00:57:19.369" style="s2">as yesterday I was giving a lecture on</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.880" end="00:57:22.519" style="s2">John Peterson organized by some students</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.369" end="00:57:24.440" style="s2">at the theology department at the code</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.519" end="00:57:27.109" style="s2">making university and they just formed a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.440" end="00:57:30.499" style="s2">student association called fleet angler</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.109" end="00:57:32.029" style="s2">which means free think free thought or</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.499" end="00:57:34.279" style="s2">free thinking or something like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.029" end="00:57:36.079" style="s2">was this controversial in other areas of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.279" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">the university or is that just over this</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.079" end="00:57:42.049" style="s2">like business of Jordan Peterson being</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:45.019" style="s2">controversial and all that or is that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.049" end="00:57:48.170" style="s2">that kind of finished he&#39;s like a year</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.019" end="00:57:53.420" style="s2">ago yeah well a year ago I did a couple</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.170" end="00:57:54.680" style="s2">of lectures and publicly oh there was a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.420" end="00:57:56.809" style="s2">little bit there was a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.680" end="00:58:00.230" style="s2">controversy about that but i but i since</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.809" end="00:58:01.849" style="s2">these things are moving like so for me i</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.230" end="00:58:05.539" style="s2">can sense there&#39;s a difference just from</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.849" end="00:58:07.849" style="s2">a year ago and yeah today so a year ago</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.539" end="00:58:12.019" style="s2">john peter I had like colleagues coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.849" end="00:58:14.269" style="s2">ooh what is this and are you not afraid</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.019" end="00:58:16.789" style="s2">or something like that yeah where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.269" end="00:58:21.319" style="s2">today it&#39;s like what john pease not</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.789" end="00:58:23.150" style="s2">interesting so I think thanks yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.319" end="00:58:25.430" style="s2">ceased he ceased to be I just read a</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.150" end="00:58:27.529" style="s2">book by renny&#39;s yard and he RAZR I</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.430" end="00:58:30.470" style="s2">talked a lot about the scapegoat and he</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.529" end="00:58:32.029" style="s2">ceased to be the scapegoat in such an</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.470" end="00:58:34.249" style="s2">intense way that he was a year and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.029" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">half ago he&#39;s kind of disappeared as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.249" end="00:58:38.509" style="s2">person who who fulfills that role and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:41.569" style="s2">he&#39;s just heard a hoard dairy now he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.509" end="00:58:43.249" style="s2">just like part of the landscape and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.569" end="00:58:46.730" style="s2">also another thing that I&#39;m experienced</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.249" end="00:58:51.980" style="s2">I think has happened is that some of</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.730" end="00:58:57.529" style="s2">these attacks on idea similar to John</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.980" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">Peterson or they were or just making</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.529" end="00:59:01.430" style="s2">these accusations like oh you&#39;re racist</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:04.430" style="s2">or you should be paying or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.430" end="00:59:07.519" style="s2">like that they used to be for free they</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.430" end="00:59:09.890" style="s2">used to be without risk you could just</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.519" end="00:59:11.329" style="s2">make these accusations and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.890" end="00:59:13.960" style="s2">you got away with it or maybe nothing</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.329" end="00:59:17.089" style="s2">happened you can just draw exercises</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.960" end="00:59:20.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not how it is anymore</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.089" end="00:59:23.480" style="s2">there&#39;s risk now in both you can make</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.480" end="00:59:26.120" style="s2">these exercises faster and feedback</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.480" end="00:59:28.340" style="s2">Luke right you can&#39;t just make I think I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.120" end="00:59:30.920" style="s2">think the mirrors there&#39;s a stronger</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.340" end="00:59:34.370" style="s2">mirror for how you behave or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.920" end="00:59:37.130" style="s2">like well I think there&#39;s a stronger I</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.370" end="00:59:43.400" style="s2">think what used to be like the silent</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.130" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">majority who would not who like who</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.400" end="00:59:46.280" style="s2">would agree with some of these ideas yes</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:47.900" style="s2">there&#39;s differences between men and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.280" end="00:59:51.170" style="s2">women or something but they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.900" end="00:59:53.690" style="s2">voice them because yeah well they would</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.170" end="00:59:56.360" style="s2">be in favor of free speech or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.690" end="00:59:58.460" style="s2">like that but they wouldn&#39;t voice it but</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.360" end="01:00:00.470" style="s2">now they&#39;ve seen so many other people</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.460" end="01:00:07.880" style="s2">voicing it so they like yeah I can also</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.470" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">say so um so I think the the yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.880" end="01:00:11.210" style="s2">gonna use the word power balance but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:13.880" style="s2">not sure that&#39;s the right word here cuz</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.210" end="01:00:16.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s this whole</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.880" end="01:00:18.680" style="s2">middle ground area opening up where yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.970" end="01:00:22.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m finding that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.680" end="01:00:25.160" style="s2">mean that&#39;s also what Jordan I mean part</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.280" end="01:00:28.610" style="s2">of what John Peters data is he sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.160" end="01:00:31.700" style="s2">invites it or a lot of non academics</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.610" end="01:00:35.750" style="s2">into the academic debate or into debates</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.700" end="01:00:38.170" style="s2">when you exclusively exclusively for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.750" end="01:00:41.930" style="s2">academics she you have a lot of like</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.170" end="01:00:44.080" style="s2">ordinary people or people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.930" end="01:00:46.310" style="s2">anything at stake in the academic world</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.080" end="01:00:49.130" style="s2">who are now engaging in these debates</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.310" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">which this means you can&#39;t get away with</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.130" end="01:00:52.490" style="s2">some of the absurdities that you could</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:54.530" style="s2">get away with it&#39;s ten years ago or</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.490" end="01:00:59.030" style="s2">something like right now you&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.530" end="01:01:01.750" style="s2">out on them so so it&#39;s is this is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.030" end="01:01:04.550" style="s2">the the the academic world the</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.750" end="01:01:10.130" style="s2">institution&#39;s falling apart or is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.550" end="01:01:11.660" style="s2">exaggerated you know yeah you know Peter</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.130" end="01:01:14.660" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.660" end="01:01:17.770" style="s2">about he talks yeah you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.660" end="01:01:23.030" style="s2">universities are sort of collapsing in</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.770" end="01:01:25.820" style="s2">institutions and I I think it&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.030" end="01:01:29.210" style="s2">both ways I think it depends on how the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.820" end="01:01:30.890" style="s2">institutions how they navigate this I</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.210" end="01:01:34.060" style="s2">think there&#39;s also opportunities here</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.890" end="01:01:36.120" style="s2">for universities if they play it right</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.060" end="01:01:38.430" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think they miss</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.120" end="01:01:40.830" style="s2">we have to collapse but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.430" end="01:01:43.530" style="s2">certainly some systems are there</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.830" end="01:01:46.800" style="s2">certainly some parts of the academic</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.530" end="01:01:52.920" style="s2">system or which which will collapse or</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.800" end="01:01:54.180" style="s2">are collapsing already so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.920" end="01:01:55.370" style="s2">what do you think I want to hear your</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.180" end="01:01:58.860" style="s2">opinion on this</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.370" end="01:02:02.520" style="s2">well I think it&#39;s definitely a collapse</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.860" end="01:02:04.200" style="s2">and restructuring time because I teach</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.520" end="01:02:05.760" style="s2">while I teach you know I teach at French</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.200" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">universities and I&#39;m not a permanent</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.760" end="01:02:10.380" style="s2">staff member I&#39;m very much an outsider</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:13.260" style="s2">so I don&#39;t get the ins and outs of</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.380" end="01:02:16.110" style="s2">things but I again I do get direct</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.260" end="01:02:17.940" style="s2">contact with the students a lot and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.110" end="01:02:19.350" style="s2">definitely have a feeling that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.940" end="01:02:21.360" style="s2">students have changed in the past few</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.350" end="01:02:22.860" style="s2">years that they&#39;re getting smarter and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.360" end="01:02:25.110" style="s2">they&#39;re teaching they&#39;re getting better</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.860" end="01:02:28.590" style="s2">at teaching themselves things and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.110" end="01:02:31.350" style="s2">so an old school teacher who has nothing</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.590" end="01:02:34.170" style="s2">relevant to say is becoming more</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.350" end="01:02:36.420" style="s2">redundant right so you have to you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.170" end="01:02:39.000" style="s2">to you have to you have to pick up the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.420" end="01:02:40.200" style="s2">pace of it and be more relevant and say</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.000" end="01:02:42.930" style="s2">things that you know be more meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.200" end="01:02:45.390" style="s2">be more relevant and be on top of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.930" end="01:02:47.190" style="s2">going on and of course you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.390" end="01:02:51.620" style="s2">like a bit with it with the technology</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.190" end="01:02:54.860" style="s2">are you gonna lose them pretty fast so</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.620" end="01:02:58.380" style="s2">yeah and also there&#39;s this you know beef</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.860" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">five five years ago ten years ago there</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.380" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">was no computers in the classroom it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:03.450" style="s2">just there&#39;s like a third element there</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:06.510" style="s2">there&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.450" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">teacher-student machine now and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.510" end="01:03:09.480" style="s2">whole new dynamic you know when they</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.330" style="s2">want a daydream they can just go into</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.480" end="01:03:14.100" style="s2">their computer and daydreamin which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.330" end="01:03:15.510" style="s2">fine I guess if the teacher is boring</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.100" end="01:03:19.020" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s better I mean maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.510" end="01:03:22.140" style="s2">learning more the class I don&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.020" end="01:03:28.440" style="s2">any screens in my class okay yeah money</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.140" end="01:03:32.700" style="s2">anyway and I think so I think mmm I</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.440" end="01:03:34.080" style="s2">think my own mmm I don&#39;t know what yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.700" end="01:03:35.640" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna toot my own horn or at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.080" end="01:03:38.340" style="s2">might say so I I work at a business</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.640" end="01:03:42.060" style="s2">school right ya know right so I think I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.340" end="01:03:43.500" style="s2">think some of the things like mmm</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.060" end="01:03:46.980" style="s2">one of the benefits of a business school</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.500" end="01:03:48.970" style="s2">is that we can&#39;t afford we we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.980" end="01:03:52.420" style="s2">more less</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.970" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">so to speak more into like this element</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.420" end="01:03:57.880" style="s2">of yeah this relates to the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.170" style="s2">outside how does this relate to the jobs</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.880" end="01:04:02.470" style="s2">that people are actually going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.170" end="01:04:04.839" style="s2">perform that&#39;s a more integrated part of</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.470" end="01:04:08.970" style="s2">our discipline or what we&#39;re doing there</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.839" end="01:04:11.770" style="s2">so in that sense I I think we&#39;re better</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.970" end="01:04:14.290" style="s2">tuned we might in some sense I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.770" end="01:04:16.960" style="s2">we&#39;re more flexible we more respond</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.290" end="01:04:18.970" style="s2">quicker just things that are coming on</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.960" end="01:04:21.420" style="s2">outside of the university and I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.970" end="01:04:21.420" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.640" end="01:04:27.069" style="s2">I teach it engineer schools and business</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.670" end="01:04:30.250" style="s2">schools so I see the difference an</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.069" end="01:04:33.640" style="s2">engineer and you know engineer well it</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.250" end="01:04:35.829" style="s2">kind of hits a segue to our discussion</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.640" end="01:04:39.400" style="s2">with guys engineers are 90 percent guys</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.829" end="01:04:42.040" style="s2">obviously and so they have a certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.400" end="01:04:44.770" style="s2">quality they&#39;re usually very they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.040" end="01:04:47.410" style="s2">usually very bright and they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.770" end="01:04:49.960" style="s2">less the businesspeople are more social</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.410" end="01:04:51.849" style="s2">they&#39;re more you know extroverted and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.960" end="01:04:53.530" style="s2">social and more on the ball in that way</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.849" end="01:04:56.500" style="s2">but the engineer guys are introverted</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.530" end="01:05:00.190" style="s2">and weird and creative and they like to</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.500" end="01:05:02.500" style="s2">go into you know different worlds and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.190" end="01:05:04.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.500" end="01:05:06.550" style="s2">I&#39;m glad I&#39;m teaching at those kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.599" end="01:05:10.750" style="s2">schools also even though my background</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.550" end="01:05:12.910" style="s2">is in the humanities literature because</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.750" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">because I again because I think these</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.910" end="01:05:17.200" style="s2">kind of schools are you know the grand</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">echo in Paris they&#39;re more they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.200" end="01:05:30.010" style="s2">pragmatic minded people so so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:32.230" style="s2">less theoretical flakiness yeah ya know</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.010" end="01:05:33.609" style="s2">that&#39;s probably true yeah I was really I</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.230" end="01:05:36.180" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve been at the business school</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.609" end="01:05:41.710" style="s2">now for ten years and I really I I</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.180" end="01:05:43.510" style="s2">really enjoy this mix of oh you must of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.710" end="01:05:45.490" style="s2">the students I mean they come there for</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.510" end="01:05:47.980" style="s2">the hunger for knowledge and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.490" end="01:05:50.710" style="s2">curious and they&#39;ve got all of that but</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.980" end="01:05:51.880" style="s2">they also like okay we want to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.710" end="01:05:54.310" style="s2">something in the world we want to get a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.880" end="01:05:56.500" style="s2">job we want to be relevant and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.310" end="01:05:59.020" style="s2">like that yeah so that&#39;s ensure and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.500" end="01:06:02.350" style="s2">and they also I sensed that at least in</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.020" end="01:06:04.720" style="s2">in my in our proactive dinner</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.350" end="01:06:06.010" style="s2">in a program where we combine philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.720" end="01:06:10.420" style="s2">and business administration or</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.010" end="01:06:12.070" style="s2">philosophy economics so and I sense that</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.420" end="01:06:15.610" style="s2">they are quite sort of either logically</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.070" end="01:06:17.820" style="s2">diverse yeah so so you can&#39;t just I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.610" end="01:06:20.170" style="s2">I mean you can&#39;t get away just yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.820" end="01:06:22.540" style="s2">capitalism is bad blah blah you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.170" end="01:06:25.560" style="s2">that way and but you can&#39;t also say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.540" end="01:06:27.820" style="s2">Oh Marcus will fix everything like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.560" end="01:06:30.450" style="s2">regardless what you say you can risk</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.820" end="01:06:34.060" style="s2">being such a challenge from either side</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.450" end="01:06:37.150" style="s2">and I really enjoy this I really love my</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.060" end="01:06:40.870" style="s2">students yeah I really really love them</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.150" end="01:06:44.530" style="s2">so and yeah I&#39;m very I&#39;m so optimistic</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.870" end="01:06:45.490" style="s2">at the moment I&#39;m really yeah even</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.530" end="01:06:48.610" style="s2">though I mean so there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.490" end="01:06:52.120" style="s2">talking about is like this huge problems</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.610" end="01:06:54.610" style="s2">but I instead at this sense that thinks</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.120" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">I&#39;m a lot of things that they&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.610" end="01:06:59.020" style="s2">in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:07:01.180" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s great okay maybe I can ask</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.020" end="01:07:04.090" style="s2">you like one more sort of pertinent</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.180" end="01:07:05.920" style="s2">question and that is when we were</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.090" end="01:07:09.210" style="s2">speaking the last on the last night of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.920" end="01:07:13.990" style="s2">this men&#39;s group yeah in Denmark you</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.210" end="01:07:17.230" style="s2">talked about Troy he wanted to he wanted</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.990" end="01:07:19.120" style="s2">to do something about starting men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.230" end="01:07:20.830" style="s2">groups in companies and we had this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.120" end="01:07:22.270" style="s2">whole discussion on the pragmatics of</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.830" end="01:07:24.760" style="s2">that and whether you know how that would</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.270" end="01:07:27.120" style="s2">work and and that kind of thing so and</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.760" end="01:07:30.730" style="s2">then I wrote this paper which kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.120" end="01:07:36.550" style="s2">nut paper excuse me a blog post which</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.730" end="01:07:38.980" style="s2">kind of was a riff on that idea that</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.550" end="01:07:41.950" style="s2">that that it would be good to have men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.980" end="01:07:45.070" style="s2">groups you know in in institutions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.950" end="01:07:47.380" style="s2">it would be good to you know which got</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.070" end="01:07:49.120" style="s2">some some some mixed reactions people</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.380" end="01:07:51.880" style="s2">thought oh you just you want to go back</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.120" end="01:07:52.930" style="s2">and we&#39;ve made so much progress and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.880" end="01:07:54.940" style="s2">say no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.930" end="01:07:56.620" style="s2">I was thinking no that&#39;s not quite right</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.940" end="01:07:58.810" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying I want to go back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.620" end="01:08:01.360" style="s2">something it&#39;s more like I want to I</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.810" end="01:08:05.890" style="s2">want to rediscover something for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.360" end="01:08:08.670" style="s2">future yeah so anyway I I like that idea</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.890" end="01:08:12.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m interested in and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.670" end="01:08:15.320" style="s2">trying to put it into into practice were</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.580" end="01:08:20.510" style="s2">you out with that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.320" end="01:08:24.890" style="s2">this a small company with two associates</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.510" end="01:08:26.299" style="s2">one is Paul who&#39;s organizing Europeans</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.890" end="01:08:29.150" style="s2">gathering and the other one is Tom who</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.299" end="01:08:31.520" style="s2">is also at the Europeans gathering and</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.150" end="01:08:34.280" style="s2">the idea so as I said also in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:37.790" style="s2">beginning I have this sense that that</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.280" end="01:08:41.569" style="s2">being a man is such an asset there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.790" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">much energy in that that you can yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.569" end="01:08:47.930" style="s2">tap into but I also and and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:49.549" style="s2">of course that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing it the</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.930" end="01:08:51.799" style="s2">European men&#39;s gathering but I also</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.549" end="01:08:53.359" style="s2">sense that for many men going to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.799" end="01:08:56.240" style="s2">Europeans men&#39;s gathering is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.359" end="01:08:57.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a big step for them like most of</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.240" end="01:09:01.100" style="s2">the men who are there they already done</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.770" end="01:09:03.380" style="s2">some kind of other self development work</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.100" end="01:09:05.810" style="s2">or something like that so forth so going</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.380" end="01:09:07.280" style="s2">to an image like that it&#39;s it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.810" end="01:09:09.170" style="s2">everyone of course and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.280" end="01:09:14.030" style="s2">different kinds of mint but they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.170" end="01:09:15.830" style="s2">also men who already sort of yeah used</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.030" end="01:09:18.740" style="s2">to thinking about themselves and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.830" end="01:09:23.420" style="s2">so what we wanted to do was to say how</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.740" end="01:09:25.400" style="s2">can we make it easier for more men you</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.420" end="01:09:30.319" style="s2">get some reap some of the benefits of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.400" end="01:09:33.970" style="s2">this work to get to do men&#39;s work so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.319" end="01:09:38.900" style="s2">and and so what we were what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.970" end="01:09:42.770" style="s2">trying to do is to present this in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.900" end="01:09:45.470" style="s2">form where it&#39;s accessible to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.770" end="01:09:48.530" style="s2">corporate world so that&#39;s to your work</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.470" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">you can kind of you can enter into</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.530" end="01:09:53.060" style="s2">mittens work and of course I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.960" end="01:09:57.110" style="s2">you have to do it in a special way and</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.060" end="01:09:59.270" style="s2">but but it is I mean what I think what</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.110" end="01:10:01.930" style="s2">you get out of what you can&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.270" end="01:10:05.300" style="s2">what you do get out of men&#39;s work is</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.930" end="01:10:08.300" style="s2">it&#39;s actually leadership I mean you get</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.300" end="01:10:09.020" style="s2">a this this ability to speak from your</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.300" end="01:10:13.370" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.020" end="01:10:14.870" style="s2">or to mobilize you&#39;re not just your head</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.370" end="01:10:17.960" style="s2">but the rest of your body in</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.870" end="01:10:19.640" style="s2">decision-making and in in your judgments</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.960" end="01:10:22.220" style="s2">and stuff that&#39;s what we train in men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.640" end="01:10:23.870" style="s2">work and I think that&#39;s beneficial in</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.220" end="01:10:25.970" style="s2">all relations it&#39;s beneficial in your</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.870" end="01:10:29.680" style="s2">family life and your kids and your wife</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.970" end="01:10:32.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s also very beneficial in</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.680" end="01:10:34.490" style="s2">your work life I mean if you work with</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.120" end="01:10:36.050" style="s2">other people it&#39;s to be able to speak</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.490" end="01:10:38.270" style="s2">from your heart and say honestly to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.050" end="01:10:40.120" style="s2">someone look when you say that I feel</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.270" end="01:10:42.830" style="s2">like this or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.120" end="01:10:45.500" style="s2">hmm so I think there&#39;s a lot of benefits</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.830" end="01:10:47.090" style="s2">in this which could also be valuable in</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.500" end="01:10:49.940" style="s2">the corporate world so that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.090" end="01:10:54.890" style="s2">trying it&#39;s called FST&#39;s the company&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.940" end="01:10:59.540" style="s2">called FS and we&#39;re still in the process</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.890" end="01:11:01.970" style="s2">of figuring out how our the one had this</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.540" end="01:11:05.480" style="s2">a certain quality to just working with</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.970" end="01:11:07.940" style="s2">men and having men work with men but of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.480" end="01:11:10.610" style="s2">course in the corporate world this this</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.940" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">men and women yeah and and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.610" end="01:11:16.730" style="s2">and with absolutely absolutely no</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:19.580" style="s2">ambition of excluding women from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.730" end="01:11:23.180" style="s2">corporate world not at all</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.580" end="01:11:25.730" style="s2">so so we also I mean I think this should</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.180" end="01:11:27.170" style="s2">also be women&#39;s work in corporation but</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.730" end="01:11:29.720" style="s2">I think now we&#39;re just starting with</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.170" end="01:11:32.570" style="s2">this men&#39;s work and seeing how what we</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.720" end="01:11:33.920" style="s2">can do with it so so basically what we</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.570" end="01:11:36.470" style="s2">want to do is do takes all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.920" end="01:11:38.350" style="s2">techniques and methods that we use in</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.470" end="01:11:41.500" style="s2">the European men&#39;s gathering and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.350" end="01:11:45.350" style="s2">introduce that to corporations or other</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.500" end="01:11:48.890" style="s2">workplaces mm-hmm sounds great</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.350" end="01:11:51.340" style="s2">yeah I was somebody Alexander was</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.890" end="01:11:58.790" style="s2">mentioning this this need for like</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.340" end="01:12:00.980" style="s2">desexualized spaces yeah what do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.790" end="01:12:03.470" style="s2">think of that as a concept it depends on</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.980" end="01:12:07.160" style="s2">what he means with desexualized spaces</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.470" end="01:12:09.290" style="s2">if he means spaces where this no well I</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.160" end="01:12:13.520" style="s2">mean the office is such a place of</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.290" end="01:12:15.890" style="s2">flirtation right and yeah okay I see</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.520" end="01:12:18.110" style="s2">that yeah so yeah okay now I see what</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.890" end="01:12:20.960" style="s2">he&#39;s getting so I think the idea is or</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.110" end="01:12:23.570" style="s2">maybe what he&#39;s as I understand what</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.960" end="01:12:25.900" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that if you take what</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.570" end="01:12:28.880" style="s2">happens if you take a group of men</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.900" end="01:12:31.880" style="s2">together in a room with no women yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.880" end="01:12:34.520" style="s2">you take what you do is you take six out</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.880" end="01:12:39.380" style="s2">of the equation yeah and when you do</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.520" end="01:12:41.210" style="s2">that you other opportunities arise so</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.380" end="01:12:43.190" style="s2">you can that&#39;s also what we experienced</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.210" end="01:12:45.469" style="s2">at the European mins nothing</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.190" end="01:12:47.300" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.469" end="01:12:49.790" style="s2">safe space yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.300" end="01:12:51.739" style="s2">and one of the paradoxes that I find in</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.790" end="01:12:55.699" style="s2">mints were widens not a paradox but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.739" end="01:12:59.000" style="s2">a is that when you bring men together</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.699" end="01:13:03.340" style="s2">only men yeah what comes out is on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.000" end="01:13:08.840" style="s2">one hand that masculinity comes out in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.340" end="01:13:10.340" style="s2">but also also their femininity or in</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.840" end="01:13:12.560" style="s2">other words their ability to care for</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.340" end="01:13:14.390" style="s2">each other and I mean I guess if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:16.670" style="s2">have people in the military or if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.390" end="01:13:18.080" style="s2">have people in a monastery they if</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.670" end="01:13:19.850" style="s2">they&#39;re if they&#39;re isolated from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.080" end="01:13:21.020" style="s2">women they have to develop that aspect</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.850" end="01:13:23.719" style="s2">of themselves right</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.020" end="01:13:25.790" style="s2">the Lord said to survive right yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.719" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">think another thing is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.790" end="01:13:30.800" style="s2">just because that&#39;s how men are I mean</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.630" style="s2">if there&#39;s a woman if you have a group</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.800" end="01:13:34.699" style="s2">of nine men and there&#39;s one woman there</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.630" end="01:13:37.010" style="s2">and regardless of what kind of a woman</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.699" end="01:13:38.600" style="s2">she is you will there&#39;s something in you</p>
