<p begin="00:00:03.300" end="00:00:08.370" style="s2">share a story with you several years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.120" end="00:00:10.410" style="s2">I set out to study the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.370" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">behavioral sciences with the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.410" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">trying to understand large-scale human</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">behavior to address the global</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:19.859" style="s2">sustainability crisis something that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">learned along the way was that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.859" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">difficult to get people in key</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:26.519" style="s2">decision-making positions to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">the importance of this problem or to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.519" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">that the solution actually exists so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">here&#39;s my story I was an atmospheric</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:38.190" style="s2">scientist six years ago when I started</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:39.690" style="s2">to really dig into the deep systemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.190" end="00:00:43.010" style="s2">problems that were causing climate</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.690" end="00:00:45.420" style="s2">change and global ecological decline I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.010" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">realized that having another scientist</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">studying this problem wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">going to solve it that the deeper or</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:54.960" style="s2">more fundamental issues reside in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">social norms and values that drive</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.960" end="00:00:58.620" style="s2">large-scale human behavior and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">incentive structures of our institutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.620" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">such as corporations that put the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:06.720" style="s2">set of priorities in play such as near</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">term profits without recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.720" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">long-term systemic risks and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.229" style="s2">actually we have to change human</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">behavior so I started studying cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.229" end="00:01:19.170" style="s2">sciences by this I mean neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:21.390" style="s2">psychology linguistics anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.170" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">a host of related fields to try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.390" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">understand how human behavior works and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:28.700" style="s2">what we need to do to change the stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">that drive our culture around growth</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.700" end="00:01:34.110" style="s2">consumption engagement and a whole host</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:36.350" style="s2">of other things and what I found was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.110" end="00:01:38.970" style="s2">that this knowledge while incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.350" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">important and absolutely essential for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.970" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">solving the deep systemic problems of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:46.399" style="s2">sustainability were really difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">get recognized prioritized and funded by</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">advocacy efforts in the sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">realm now why is that it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">one of the fundamental issues that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:59.729" style="s2">grappling with in dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:02.450" style="s2">sustainability is a question of what it</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.729" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">means to be human there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.450" end="00:02:07.380" style="s2">speculations a lot of assumptions about</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">what it means to be human they go way</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.380" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">back in our philosophic history and many</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:13.630" style="s2">of those assumptions it turns out are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.460" style="s2">not grounded</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.630" end="00:02:17.050" style="s2">in truth the not grounded in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.460" end="00:02:19.870" style="s2">fundamental understanding of how human</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.050" end="00:02:21.670" style="s2">beings work and furthermore they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.870" end="00:02:23.560" style="s2">deeply tied to our sense of identity of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.670" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">who we are and what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.560" end="00:02:30.520" style="s2">good person so for example if you study</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:32.280" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience which is this</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.520" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">field of research that looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.280" end="00:02:37.420" style="s2">processing of information in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:38.890" style="s2">and the exchanges of chemicals through</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.420" end="00:02:41.080" style="s2">hormones in the brain that shape our</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.890" end="00:02:43.450" style="s2">emotional responses and how we think</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.080" end="00:02:46.270" style="s2">about and understand the world you learn</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.450" end="00:02:48.390" style="s2">that most of what we consider to be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.270" end="00:02:50.260" style="s2">underlying drivers of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.390" end="00:02:53.320" style="s2">happen outside of conscious awareness</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.260" end="00:02:55.900" style="s2">and are largely shaped by what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.320" end="00:02:58.990" style="s2">considered to be non-rational driving</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.900" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">forces so what this means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.990" end="00:03:03.850" style="s2">way we make decisions is not a process</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:05.770" style="s2">of logical deduction based on facts that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.850" end="00:03:08.740" style="s2">we see in the world but it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.770" end="00:03:10.570" style="s2">implicit beliefs values judgments that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.740" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">are strongly emotionally driven and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.570" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">deeply culturally contingent in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">words they&#39;re about who we think we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:19.750" style="s2">and what it means to make good decisions</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">so to go into a room where there are a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.750" end="00:03:24.040" style="s2">set of experts who believe that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.450" end="00:03:25.240" style="s2">have an understanding of the facts that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.040" end="00:03:27.610" style="s2">they have an understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.240" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">problems and the solutions and to convey</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.610" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">to them that those understandings are</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:34.270" style="s2">not grounded in rational deductive logic</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:36.750" style="s2">but in fact are shaped by preconceived</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.270" end="00:03:40.840" style="s2">notions implicit value judgments and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.750" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">strong social emotional ties to identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.840" end="00:03:45.250" style="s2">is a deeply threatening proposition so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">one of the major barriers to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.250" end="00:03:50.410" style="s2">understanding and applying insights like</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:53.170" style="s2">these from the cognitive sciences is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.410" end="00:03:57.340" style="s2">that people in decision-making positions</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.170" end="00:03:59.950" style="s2">have to understand that their own ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.340" end="00:04:01.420" style="s2">of thinking could be biased and could be</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.950" end="00:04:04.810" style="s2">inhibiting them for making effective</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:08.680" style="s2">decisions in other words their sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.810" end="00:04:11.110" style="s2">free will and autonomous freedom to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.680" end="00:04:14.770" style="s2">decisions is fundamentally threatened</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.110" end="00:04:17.859" style="s2">and potentially unviable that&#39;s a pretty</p>
