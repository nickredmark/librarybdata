<p begin="00:02:45.990" end="00:02:51.570" style="s2">so Peter mentioned I just published a</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.820" end="00:02:55.180" style="s2">book recently called high weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.570" end="00:02:58.180" style="s2">drugs esoterica and visionary experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.180" end="00:03:00.030" style="s2">in the 1970s and when I started this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.180" end="00:03:02.680" style="s2">project I was really just interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.030" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">you know some psychedelic and visionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.680" end="00:03:07.540" style="s2">figures from the 70s philip k dick</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">terence mckenna and Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.540" end="00:03:11.050" style="s2">and I just sort of noticed some</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:12.580" style="s2">similarities between what they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.050" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">doing and so I really wanted to tell a</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.580" end="00:03:19.450" style="s2">story about the 1970s and about these</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:21.460" style="s2">wild and woolly Psychonauts and writers</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.450" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">who were both visionary in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.460" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">experiences visionary and extreme and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:30.220" style="s2">their experiences and in their writings</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.930" style="s2">but as I was running more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.220" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">kind of like the world was changing</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.930" end="00:03:36.760" style="s2">around me I started to realize more and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:38.710" style="s2">more that I was using these things to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.760" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">kind of try to understand something</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.710" end="00:03:43.810" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening to us today and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:47.320" style="s2">while I didn&#39;t end up spending that much</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.810" end="00:03:50.860" style="s2">time in the book reflecting on how this</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.320" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">weirdness reflected the conditions today</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.860" end="00:03:58.180" style="s2">I did I did some as I spent like a year</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:04:00.160" style="s2">doing podcasts about the book which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.180" end="00:04:02.260" style="s2">you know kind of trailed off now</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.160" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">although I I did an audiobook version</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.260" end="00:04:06.130" style="s2">that came out earlier this year and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">did some more press around that and some</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.130" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">more discussions and I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:10.900" style="s2">way the audio book came out a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:13.600" style="s2">people find it a little easier to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.900" end="00:04:17.080" style="s2">than the somewhat academic density of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.600" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">the of the book but as I was doing these</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.080" end="00:04:19.930" style="s2">talks I realized more and more I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:22.690" style="s2">just talking about what was going on now</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.930" end="00:04:24.760" style="s2">the politics of consciousness now the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:26.380" style="s2">politics of psychedelics now how why are</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.760" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">all these things going on now what do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.380" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">how do we navigate a meltdown and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:34.750" style="s2">consensus reality which has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:37.030" style="s2">psychedelic quality not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.750" end="00:04:38.710" style="s2">particularly pleasant one</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.030" end="00:04:40.630" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s part of what I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.710" end="00:04:43.000" style="s2">writing about as well it&#39;s not some kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.630" end="00:04:47.800" style="s2">of happy fluff</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.000" end="00:04:49.690" style="s2">the psychedelic sort of ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:51.640" style="s2">you&#39;re getting these days but really</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.690" end="00:04:53.490" style="s2">more wrestling with some of the darker</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.640" end="00:04:55.390" style="s2">sides of it the relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.490" end="00:04:57.940" style="s2">psychopathology the relationship to</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.940" end="00:05:05.560" style="s2">integrate and what happens especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.250" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">when those things start to resonate and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.560" end="00:05:11.500" style="s2">reflect on actual political realities</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:14.500" style="s2">that themselves aren&#39;t particularly rosy</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.500" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">I think one thing that I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.500" end="00:05:18.640" style="s2">say just to connect it like why is he</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:22.480" style="s2">talking about the 70s is that in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.640" end="00:05:26.100" style="s2">of ways if we if we can look back at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.480" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">and find a moment in American history</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.100" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">and I think this is you know as true I</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">have to say North American history</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:36.669" style="s2">perhaps but certainly in the United</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:38.530" style="s2">States that the closest era that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.669" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">to what works I think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.530" end="00:05:43.450" style="s2">are experiencing now is the early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:45.669" style="s2">because it was a time of of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.450" end="00:05:50.530" style="s2">disappointment of frustration there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.669" end="00:05:52.510" style="s2">a lot of divergence in identity in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.530" end="00:05:55.840" style="s2">a lot of the sort of multicultural world</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.510" end="00:05:57.790" style="s2">that we&#39;re we&#39;re familiar with now was</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.840" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">in many ways kind of both celebrated and</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.790" end="00:06:02.919" style="s2">engineered at that time in history so</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">there&#39;s more and more lifestyles and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.919" end="00:06:06.910" style="s2">more and more perspectives there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">and more multiculturalism going on in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.910" end="00:06:12.190" style="s2">good and in challenging ways and at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:14.380" style="s2">same time there was an overall vibe of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.190" end="00:06:16.990" style="s2">bummer you know there was a energy</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.380" end="00:06:18.940" style="s2">crisis in the early 70s there was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.990" end="00:06:22.360" style="s2">rise of the modern terrorist you know</p>

<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:50.440" style="s2">and also since the things weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.910" end="00:06:51.820" style="s2">necessarily gonna get better that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.440" end="00:06:54.250" style="s2">revolution that everybody thought was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.820" end="00:06:56.650" style="s2">gonna happen sometime in the 60s whether</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.000" end="00:07:05.110" style="s2">happen and so people were kind of thrown</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.710" end="00:07:07.479" style="s2">back on their own devices and had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.110" end="00:07:10.090" style="s2">make make their own meaning they had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.479" end="00:07:12.039" style="s2">produce you know participate in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.090" end="00:07:13.630" style="s2">of sense making and from our distance</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.039" end="00:07:16.110" style="s2">now we can see a lot of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.630" end="00:07:18.970" style="s2">that went south you know a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.110" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">what we&#39;ve come to call the New Age and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.970" end="00:07:23.560" style="s2">a lot of psychotherapy groups and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:26.110" style="s2">of cults a lot of new religious</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.560" end="00:07:27.729" style="s2">movements a lot of you know gurus from</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.110" end="00:07:30.789" style="s2">the east like that was the time when all</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.729" end="00:07:32.740" style="s2">this stuff really got rolling kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.789" end="00:07:34.150" style="s2">the wake of the disappointments of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.740" end="00:07:35.860" style="s2">counterculture but the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.150" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">something else had to happen we had that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.860" end="00:07:40.210" style="s2">we had to make meaning together</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:42.910" style="s2">individually and so the whole mode of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.210" end="00:07:45.220" style="s2">the seeker as someone who was you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.910" end="00:07:47.650" style="s2">perhaps looking for more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.220" end="00:07:49.150" style="s2">solutions but in many cases and this was</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.650" end="00:07:50.949" style="s2">certainly very true for the people that</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.150" end="00:07:54.310" style="s2">I was writing about is that they all had</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.949" end="00:07:56.889" style="s2">political motivations in a weird way for</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.310" end="00:07:58.900" style="s2">plunging into psychedelic experience in</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.889" end="00:08:01.000" style="s2">their own strange experiments they</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.900" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">weren&#39;t like dropping out exactly it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.000" end="00:08:06.460" style="s2">more a sense that since reality is sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.280" end="00:08:09.880" style="s2">of incomprehensible or spiraling out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.460" end="00:08:13.180" style="s2">control why not see if like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.880" end="00:08:15.310" style="s2">stuff is going to work and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.180" end="00:08:16.750" style="s2">final little motif that comes up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.310" end="00:08:20.380" style="s2">definitely related to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.750" end="00:08:23.020" style="s2">mimetic Tribe stuff not just the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.380" end="00:08:25.810" style="s2">sense of multiple perspectives in</p>

<p begin="00:08:25.810" end="00:08:30.280" style="s2">acknowledge these multiple perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.820" end="00:08:32.110" style="s2">but also some of the inherent you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.280" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">rabbit holing that goes on and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:08:35.950" style="s2">particularly the rise of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:37.810" style="s2">theory and this is the final kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.950" end="00:08:41.320" style="s2">connection that I&#39;d make is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.810" end="00:08:43.719" style="s2">paranoia was like a dominant emotion in</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.320" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">these beers particularly in the early</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.719" end="00:08:47.260" style="s2">seventies there&#39;s there was always</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:49.930" style="s2">paranoia in the counterculture because</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.260" end="00:08:53.950" style="s2">there was so much infiltration by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.930" end="00:08:55.420" style="s2">FBI by police COINTELPRO in fact a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.950" end="00:08:56.920" style="s2">of years people thought you know all you</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.420" end="00:09:00.779" style="s2">guys are just being paranoid and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.920" end="00:09:03.520" style="s2">like when we actually find out how much</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.779" end="00:09:05.589" style="s2">malfeasance was being practiced by these</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.520" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">hidden agencies who were not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.589" end="00:09:10.110" style="s2">observing but acting as agent</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">provocateurs and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.110" end="00:09:14.310" style="s2">you know making political moves now as</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">well as bumping people off I mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.310" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">really a you know nasty scene but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:22.670" style="s2">of paranoia was justified but it became</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:25.470" style="s2">into a sort of more you know psychic</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.670" end="00:09:28.050" style="s2">cosmological frame in the 1970s and if</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.470" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">you go through or especially early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.050" end="00:09:32.910" style="s2">popular culture which is saturated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">sort of psychedelia and melancholy and a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.910" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">kind of technological frustration and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:39.810" style="s2">paranoia you see a lot of the great kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:42.060" style="s2">of conspiracy movies come up in the in</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.810" end="00:09:44.060" style="s2">the early to mid 1970s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.060" end="00:09:46.740" style="s2">another kind of point of resonance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.060" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">finally along these lines just to kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.740" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">of underscore a connection and then we</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">can talk more about now the chapters</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:55.560" style="s2">that I wrote about Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:58.950" style="s2">are particularly important in the zone</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.560" end="00:10:02.459" style="s2">because Robert Anton Wilson wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.950" end="00:10:04.140" style="s2">with a co-author Robert Shaye they wrote</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.459" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">it in the late 60s mostly but it came</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.140" end="00:10:09.180" style="s2">out in 1975 called</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">illuminatus and in Illuminatus they play</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.180" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">in a an archaic romping goofy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:19.410" style="s2">brilliant kind of satirical kind of Pulp</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:21.269" style="s2">Fiction e-way with the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.410" end="00:10:24.930" style="s2">conspiracy basically idea that all</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.269" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">conspiracies are true and in that a game</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.930" end="00:10:29.570" style="s2">they have this all this lower about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:32.459" style="s2">Illuminati which is partly based on</p>

<p begin="00:10:32.459" end="00:10:36.839" style="s2">actual history and then partly stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.130" end="00:10:39.660" style="s2">that they were just inventing and making</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.839" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">up drawing from a cult fiction and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.660" end="00:10:44.820" style="s2">science fiction and weird stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">know making a lot of it up but in many</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.820" end="00:10:49.800" style="s2">ways the environment the vibe of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:51.720" style="s2">book is very resonant now particularly</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.800" end="00:10:54.120" style="s2">when we think about how central</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.720" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">conspiracy theory has come to be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.120" end="00:10:59.459" style="s2">terms of consensus reality how to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:02.790" style="s2">about it how it works and in in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.459" end="00:11:05.250" style="s2">ways how to sort of move through it like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.790" end="00:11:06.870" style="s2">rather than just put it aside and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.250" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s all the crazy stuff that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.870" end="00:11:10.740" style="s2">people who can&#39;t think are indulging</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:12.029" style="s2">themselves in instead going but you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.740" end="00:11:13.970" style="s2">actually we have to look at it because</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.029" end="00:11:16.500" style="s2">there&#39;s some stuff in there that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.970" end="00:11:18.630" style="s2">factually true and there&#39;s some stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.500" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">there even more so that it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.630" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">allegorically true meaning that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">like okay it might not be literally true</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.770" end="00:11:52.770" style="s2">and in some ways I try to read</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.270" end="00:13:25.620" style="s2">there for the intro yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:27.990" style="s2">good Robert Anton Wilson was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.620" end="00:13:29.550" style="s2">influence on me and his sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.990" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">guerrilla ontology you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.550" end="00:13:32.970" style="s2">purposely expose yourself to these</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:35.190" style="s2">bizarre ideas to kind of create that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.970" end="00:13:36.779" style="s2">cognitive distance so you can kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.190" end="00:13:38.890" style="s2">comfortable with them in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.779" end="00:13:41.130" style="s2">and I find that very helpful especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.890" end="00:13:44.050" style="s2">with the conspiracy theory narratives</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.130" end="00:13:45.610" style="s2">because if you just dive into that like</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.050" end="00:13:47.520" style="s2">a performative agnostic and act as if</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.610" end="00:13:50.350" style="s2">it&#39;s true it&#39;s like radical paranoia</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.520" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">overcomes you and then if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.350" end="00:13:53.640" style="s2">a good relationship with that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:57.459" style="s2">gonna run into some of these narratives</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.640" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s I&#39;m at the stall here people</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.459" end="00:14:00.130" style="s2">are know I&#39;m using this like term</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:01.510" style="s2">liminal war instead of the culture world</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.130" end="00:14:03.339" style="s2">this is a liminal state right now and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.510" end="00:14:05.260" style="s2">there&#39;s like a war in order to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.339" end="00:14:07.450" style="s2">Gaslight our minds and to believe a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.260" end="00:14:09.910" style="s2">certain narratives and what is your</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.450" end="00:14:11.529" style="s2">sense of the state especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.910" end="00:14:14.080" style="s2">conspiracy theory stuff coming on like</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.529" end="00:14:16.300" style="s2">you and on and all this energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.080" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">happened in the noosphere right now yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.300" end="00:14:21.130" style="s2">well one of the ways that I deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:23.500" style="s2">is I try to try to act like a like an</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.130" end="00:14:25.209" style="s2">anthropologist or a cultural historian</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.500" end="00:14:28.690" style="s2">or something like that which is that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.209" end="00:14:32.260" style="s2">don&#39;t try to put on my mind the decision</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:35.320" style="s2">about what it means or what truth is in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.260" end="00:14:37.899" style="s2">it or because in some ways if you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.320" end="00:14:40.420" style="s2">look if you go into the zone if you go</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.899" end="00:14:42.850" style="s2">down the rabbit hole looking to figure</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.420" end="00:14:45.070" style="s2">out what you think is true you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.850" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">already hooked in a certain way like</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.070" end="00:14:50.740" style="s2">they&#39;ve already that&#39;s the bait or</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s some of the bait and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.740" end="00:14:53.740" style="s2">mean that that&#39;s not something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">gonna want to know and want to do but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.740" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">try to like get at it from a kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:15:04.570" style="s2">another angle and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:10.180" style="s2">ways to do it is also sort of be looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.570" end="00:15:12.279" style="s2">for the al the allegorical meaning of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.180" end="00:15:14.740" style="s2">so that you&#39;re not either going yes or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.279" end="00:15:17.500" style="s2">no so it&#39;s not like oh I find out okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.740" end="00:15:19.510" style="s2">you say whatever Bill Gates is this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.500" end="00:15:21.790" style="s2">that and okay there&#39;s the vaccine is he</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.510" end="00:15:24.610" style="s2">still implanted chips in it dadada and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.790" end="00:15:29.140" style="s2">that&#39;s actually happening you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.610" end="00:15:32.620" style="s2">have enough investment in let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.140" end="00:15:36.390" style="s2">what what remains of journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.620" end="00:15:38.440" style="s2">integrity and scientific procedures and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.390" end="00:15:41.350" style="s2">conventional forms of authority that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.440" end="00:15:42.700" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that but if I go in there</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.350" end="00:15:44.829" style="s2">and I go okay no that&#39;s bullsh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.700" end="00:15:46.450" style="s2">just crazy then all I can really do if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.829" end="00:15:47.950" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to empathize with you is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.450" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">maybe say well you&#39;re just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.950" end="00:15:50.019" style="s2">paranoid and you didn&#39;t you were you</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:51.329" style="s2">didn&#39;t have her</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.019" end="00:15:53.649" style="s2">education so you&#39;re not really talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.329" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">bah-bah-bah basically just be kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.649" end="00:15:57.309" style="s2">snob to write them off that&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:00.459" style="s2">not what I&#39;m talking about that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.309" end="00:16:02.649" style="s2">this perilous path so it&#39;s to go in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.459" end="00:16:06.329" style="s2">there and actually really reckon with</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.649" end="00:16:09.100" style="s2">the allegory what is the historical</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.329" end="00:16:10.600" style="s2">condition that is being narrative eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.100" end="00:16:12.519" style="s2">door mythologized</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.600" end="00:16:14.350" style="s2">with elements of truth I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.519" end="00:16:17.769" style="s2">it&#39;s all bullshit I&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.350" end="00:16:19.509" style="s2">it gets constellated as a myth because</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.769" end="00:16:22.439" style="s2">the myth has something to say that in</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.509" end="00:16:25.029" style="s2">many ways is more well certainly more</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.439" end="00:16:26.980" style="s2">convincing to me but often more</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.029" end="00:16:29.439" style="s2">pertinent than the specifics of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.980" end="00:16:31.420" style="s2">particular scenario which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.439" end="00:16:33.279" style="s2">right lies right next to all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.420" end="00:16:35.439" style="s2">other scenarios so it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.279" end="00:16:36.850" style="s2">you&#39;re going in there trying to get a</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.439" end="00:16:39.309" style="s2">picture of a bigger well it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.850" end="00:16:41.769" style="s2">like a dream analysis where you go into</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.309" end="00:16:43.449" style="s2">the dream you don&#39;t the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.769" end="00:16:45.399" style="s2">dream the details of the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.449" end="00:16:48.009" style="s2">dream maybe they&#39;re useful maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.399" end="00:16:51.790" style="s2">not but the pattern of the dream and</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.009" end="00:16:53.889" style="s2">most importantly the effect of the dream</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.790" end="00:16:56.619" style="s2">is significant and that&#39;s another part</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.889" end="00:17:00.429" style="s2">of I think being a sense maker today and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.619" end="00:17:02.499" style="s2">you talk about being embodied and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.429" end="00:17:04.689" style="s2">embodiment to me isn&#39;t just that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.499" end="00:17:06.909" style="s2">grounded in your own physical practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.689" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">your own capacity to be you know strong</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.909" end="00:17:11.139" style="s2">and balanced and healthy as you can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:14.049" style="s2">within this just as a way to keep some</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.139" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">ground in the picture but the body is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.049" end="00:17:18.730" style="s2">also the emotions it&#39;s also a fact and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:20.620" style="s2">add it&#39;s important to actually stress</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.730" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">that little technical difference because</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.620" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">when we say emotions we we tend to mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:28.600" style="s2">the emotions that we can name that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:31.240" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling fear right now I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.600" end="00:17:33.490" style="s2">scared or like oh you&#39;re you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.240" end="00:17:34.809" style="s2">you know oh this is joyful I&#39;m really so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.490" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">happy that you said that and those are</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.809" end="00:17:39.639" style="s2">we can identify emotion happiness</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:42.399" style="s2">emotion fear effect is something a</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.639" end="00:17:45.279" style="s2">little bit below that that clear surface</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.399" end="00:17:48.039" style="s2">we may be motivated by ethics that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.279" end="00:17:49.690" style="s2">not aware of um it&#39;s not quite like</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.039" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">instinct that&#39;s a little strong it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.690" end="00:17:53.889" style="s2">little behavioral affect is more like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:56.139" style="s2">feeling but a feeling that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.889" end="00:17:58.659" style="s2">necessarily acknowledged now here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.139" end="00:18:01.299" style="s2">really clear example that plays into</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.659" end="00:18:03.910" style="s2">both the conversation about mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.299" end="00:18:06.060" style="s2">tribes and conspiracy theory but but</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.910" end="00:18:08.770" style="s2">from the past so it&#39;s easier to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.060" end="00:18:11.950" style="s2">which is like if you look at the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.770" end="00:18:14.620" style="s2">right-wing radio you know let&#39;s say in</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.950" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">the 80&#39;s 90&#39;s you know right around that</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.620" end="00:18:18.910" style="s2">but whenever you tapped into it so goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">on all you all you want and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.910" end="00:18:22.570" style="s2">as part of this Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:24.100" style="s2">practice of listening to people that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.570" end="00:18:26.590" style="s2">don&#39;t agree with it really sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.100" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">wrestling with it and trying not to just</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.590" end="00:18:31.420" style="s2">write it off but not trying to believe</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.270" end="00:18:32.830" style="s2">it but kind of resonating with it is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.420" end="00:18:35.860" style="s2">metaphor I use a lot like what does it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.830" end="00:18:37.630" style="s2">mean to resonate with a you know a white</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.860" end="00:18:39.010" style="s2">nationalist and just what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.630" end="00:18:40.000" style="s2">like how are they go where are they</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.010" end="00:18:42.760" style="s2">coming from where are they coming from</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.000" end="00:18:44.230" style="s2">and to me that&#39;s part of just as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.760" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">little side note that&#39;s part of again</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.230" end="00:18:49.500" style="s2">being a kind of practitioner of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">liminal space is to develop the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.500" end="00:18:55.570" style="s2">for real resonance which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:57.610" style="s2">agreement but it it definitely it</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.570" end="00:18:59.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it also doesn&#39;t mean putting a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.610" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">label on someone so you can just put it</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.680" end="00:19:01.210" style="s2">over there on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:03.250" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.210" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">it means like what does this feel like</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.250" end="00:19:08.950" style="s2">what are the cluster of images and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.810" style="s2">emotions and stories and histories that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.950" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">are coming together in this position of</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.810" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">a contemporary white nationalist or a</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:22.120" style="s2">and try and allowing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.100" end="00:19:26.830" style="s2">resonate as a form of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.120" end="00:19:30.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t imply any kind of agreement or</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.830" end="00:19:31.570" style="s2">support of these positions so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.010" end="00:19:33.010" style="s2">just how I do I mean I&#39;m saying everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.570" end="00:19:35.110" style="s2">should do it but that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.010" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">being kind of an anthropologist as a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.110" end="00:19:39.100" style="s2">of moving through these worlds so to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">take the example so I used to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.100" end="00:19:42.670" style="s2">a lot of right-wing radio when I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:45.250" style="s2">driving alone I just go to the am dial</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.670" end="00:19:46.390" style="s2">and and I was you know I listened to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.250" end="00:19:47.560" style="s2">and whatever and here you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.390" end="00:19:50.410" style="s2">great example when I&#39;m talking but you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.560" end="00:19:53.170" style="s2">can listen to the arguments they say</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.410" end="00:19:55.720" style="s2">this they spin this news story this way</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.170" end="00:19:57.430" style="s2">people call up and they&#39;re they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.720" end="00:19:58.810" style="s2">have a lot of good knowledge and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.430" end="00:20:00.430" style="s2">come you know they&#39;re referring to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.810" end="00:20:02.560" style="s2">things that never happened or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.430" end="00:20:05.860" style="s2">the you can stay on that level of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.560" end="00:20:08.190" style="s2">language and argument and information</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.860" end="00:20:11.320" style="s2">and history and whatever okay fine</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.190" end="00:20:13.660" style="s2">but after a while I was like wait that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.320" end="00:20:16.420" style="s2">stuff is all just like a play it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.660" end="00:20:17.500" style="s2">just it&#39;s like a again a lure</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.420" end="00:20:20.890" style="s2">what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.500" end="00:20:24.820" style="s2">going on here is just the generation of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.890" end="00:20:28.480" style="s2">a few basic effects so you develop the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:31.540" style="s2">sense of being out of control and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.480" end="00:20:34.210" style="s2">you develop a sense of being righteous</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.540" end="00:20:37.540" style="s2">you develop a sense of resentment who a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.210" end="00:20:38.920" style="s2">lot a resentment so that the story you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.540" end="00:20:42.190" style="s2">could almost look at like what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.920" end="00:20:44.470" style="s2">managed here are these very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.190" end="00:20:48.040" style="s2">effects that are collectively organized</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.470" end="00:20:50.290" style="s2">and then latched on to various talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.040" end="00:20:52.630" style="s2">points so once you get into the way in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.290" end="00:20:54.400" style="s2">which right-wing radio like you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.630" end="00:20:56.170" style="s2">all the political parties do this I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.400" end="00:20:59.020" style="s2">not that the left does it just as much</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.170" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">where there&#39;s certain effects that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.020" end="00:21:04.750" style="s2">generated and then they&#39;re attached to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:06.220" style="s2">particular talking points or narrative</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.750" end="00:21:08.620" style="s2">events that are going on in the news</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.220" end="00:21:12.610" style="s2">cycle as a way to give them more weight</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.620" end="00:21:15.630" style="s2">on the liberal side let&#39;s say the when</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.610" end="00:21:18.640" style="s2">they were jailing the the children of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.630" end="00:21:21.660" style="s2">undocumented you know people crossing</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.640" end="00:21:24.580" style="s2">the border and it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.660" end="00:21:27.820" style="s2">understandable response and yet the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.580" end="00:21:30.550" style="s2">in which the child and the cage and all</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.820" end="00:21:33.030" style="s2">that was was sort of manipulated if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.550" end="00:21:35.890" style="s2">will through the news cycle among</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.030" end="00:21:37.450" style="s2">liberal progressives and you could even</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.890" end="00:21:39.670" style="s2">see the way people were like that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.450" end="00:21:40.300" style="s2">line in the sand that&#39;s it I can&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.670" end="00:21:43.780" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.300" end="00:21:47.290" style="s2">was like oh that&#39;s more of that stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.780" end="00:21:49.390" style="s2">that effect awareness beginning getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.290" end="00:21:51.070" style="s2">wise and that&#39;s part of resonance part</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.390" end="00:21:53.530" style="s2">of resonating with somebody else is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.070" end="00:21:56.410" style="s2">get their effect which you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.530" end="00:21:58.450" style="s2">appreciate even if you don&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.410" end="00:21:59.710" style="s2">don&#39;t believe it&#39;s justifiable you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.450" end="00:22:00.850" style="s2">you don&#39;t we actually deserve that kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.710" end="00:22:03.250" style="s2">of resentment man you&#39;re doing pretty</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.850" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">good or you really don&#39;t agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.250" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">way that it&#39;s attached itself to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:10.060" style="s2">of narrative but the effect itself is</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:11.770" style="s2">more like in your body it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.060" end="00:22:13.960" style="s2">that&#39;s actually there whether you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.770" end="00:22:17.590" style="s2">it to be or you haven&#39;t a story about it</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.960" end="00:22:19.300" style="s2">or not so that&#39;s kind of a way that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.590" end="00:22:20.650" style="s2">I try to move through this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.300" end="00:22:22.270" style="s2">it&#39;s hard it&#39;s really hard with</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.650" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">conspiracy theory I don&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:25.990" style="s2">like it very much anymore I used to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.090" style="s2">interested in it more when I was younger</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.990" end="00:22:30.310" style="s2">and I was into Robert Anton Wilson and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.090" end="00:22:31.059" style="s2">it was kind of a thrill because it was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.310" end="00:22:34.330" style="s2">way of playing</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.059" end="00:22:35.980" style="s2">with my own paranoia as a kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.330" end="00:22:37.539" style="s2">know like sniffing glue or something</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.980" end="00:22:39.970" style="s2">like whoa I&#39;m getting really paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.539" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">had a weird dream and like Wow</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.970" end="00:22:51.070" style="s2">and now it&#39;s I feel I tend to feel more</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:54.220" style="s2">burdened by the terror of confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.070" end="00:22:56.379" style="s2">exists behind people&#39;s convictions it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.220" end="00:22:58.870" style="s2">like I can&#39;t believe the conviction I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.379" end="00:23:02.860" style="s2">sorry I just you don&#39;t have the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.870" end="00:23:07.409" style="s2">to produce this coherent a model of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.860" end="00:23:09.820" style="s2">entire other nefarious multi-tentacled</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.409" end="00:23:12.549" style="s2">historical event that the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.820" end="00:23:13.929" style="s2">don&#39;t really see that way I just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.549" end="00:23:16.809" style="s2">buy your conviction</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.929" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">so what effectively are you doing with</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.809" end="00:23:21.820" style="s2">your conviction what is behind that and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:23.950" style="s2">then there&#39;s the sense of tremendous out</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.820" end="00:23:26.049" style="s2">of being out of control of not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.950" end="00:23:28.749" style="s2">how do we proceed when we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.049" end="00:23:31.029" style="s2">when we really don&#39;t know you know and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.749" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what this trickier work</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.029" end="00:23:35.559" style="s2">of sense making is is to become more</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:37.869" style="s2">sensible about how we proceed when we</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.559" end="00:23:40.779" style="s2">really can&#39;t know about a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.869" end="00:23:43.990" style="s2">or when we know that we&#39;re being you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.779" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">know liminal II hit or manipulated or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.990" end="00:23:47.860" style="s2">drawn into things so how do we move</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:49.720" style="s2">through that how do we keep talking how</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.860" end="00:23:51.999" style="s2">do we keep building coherent models of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.720" end="00:23:54.220" style="s2">the world and you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.999" end="00:23:56.919" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s not easy work and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.220" end="00:23:59.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of easier ways to handle</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.919" end="00:24:02.110" style="s2">it and so you get around peoples effect</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.860" end="00:24:05.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s a you know so it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.110" end="00:24:08.230" style="s2">tough so I try to I I do not close the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.440" end="00:24:09.730" style="s2">door on conspiracy stuff I stay up on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.230" end="00:24:13.419" style="s2">I have particular opinions opinions</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.730" end="00:24:15.820" style="s2">about Q and on and and could you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.419" end="00:24:18.610" style="s2">talk more about that but I also try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.820" end="00:24:21.159" style="s2">limit my I don&#39;t want to become like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.610" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">conspiracy guy because it&#39;s just too</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.159" end="00:24:25.269" style="s2">unhealthy for me after a while like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:29.289" style="s2">can feel that this is not this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.269" end="00:24:29.980" style="s2">good for you you know growing up yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.289" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.980" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">I&#39;ll pivot to the questions and I was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:35.980" style="s2">lot of good questions in the chat box I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.289" style="s2">think we were talking when I came on</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.980" end="00:24:39.909" style="s2">your podcast last about like method</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.289" end="00:24:42.580" style="s2">acting different reality tunnels in</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.909" end="00:24:45.010" style="s2">order to achieve that and maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.580" end="00:24:47.350" style="s2">something we can talk about offline</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.010" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">at a later date but we have a wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.350" end="00:24:51.340" style="s2">here as a mission of the stoah and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.590" style="s2">whole idea here is develop like a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.340" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">relationship with unknowingness and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.590" end="00:24:56.919" style="s2">how to do that what kind of life</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:24:58.780" style="s2">practices can we do that in an ecology</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.919" end="00:25:00.580" style="s2">that would help with that and so we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.780" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">have that communicative prowess when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.580" end="00:25:04.690" style="s2">can method act someone into reality</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:05.919" style="s2">tunnel but are with ourselves to that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.690" end="00:25:07.150" style="s2">can like stay in the state of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.919" end="00:25:12.160" style="s2">unknowingness without getting seduced</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.150" end="00:25:13.059" style="s2">your gaslighted or whatever so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.160" end="00:25:14.980" style="s2">this is a good question to start off</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.059" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">with from Joshua Joshua would you like</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.980" end="00:25:23.890" style="s2">to unmute yourself and ask your question</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.890" end="00:25:28.049" style="s2">that code is weird I&#39;m asking because</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.840" end="00:25:38.830" style="s2">that&#39;s really great and I didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.250" end="00:25:40.809" style="s2">define what is the term weird so this</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.830" end="00:25:44.830" style="s2">lets me do do it I really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.809" end="00:25:48.040" style="s2">that question in in in high weirdness I</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.830" end="00:25:50.650" style="s2">use the category of the weird to talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.040" end="00:25:53.110" style="s2">about a couple of things one is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.650" end="00:25:55.450" style="s2">sense of liminality that happens when</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.110" end="00:25:57.730" style="s2">consensus your consensus reality or</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.450" end="00:26:01.059" style="s2">ordinary reality begins to melt down</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.730" end="00:26:03.610" style="s2">but particularly I was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.059" end="00:26:05.470" style="s2">those experiences and feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.610" end="00:26:09.150" style="s2">relationships that happen when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.470" end="00:26:13.570" style="s2">not invoking some kind of otherworldly</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.150" end="00:26:15.190" style="s2">mystical or religious power so I like</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.570" end="00:26:19.450" style="s2">take an example and then I&#39;ll bring it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.190" end="00:26:21.400" style="s2">into the co vid you know like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.450" end="00:26:21.820" style="s2">you have what it feels like a prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.400" end="00:26:24.280" style="s2">dream</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.820" end="00:26:26.860" style="s2">you know you like you had the dream you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.280" end="00:26:28.360" style="s2">wrote it down two days later the thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.860" end="00:26:30.669" style="s2">you wrote down exactly happened to</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.360" end="00:26:32.110" style="s2">yellow Chevrolet pulled up and almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.669" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">hit the baby or whatever the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.110" end="00:26:39.309" style="s2">it&#39;s in my book so if you are someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:42.280" style="s2">who who you know accepts multiple</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.309" end="00:26:44.650" style="s2">dimensions fate it&#39;s all written</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.280" end="00:26:47.110" style="s2">beforehand need a large abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.650" end="00:26:48.880" style="s2">about the true metaphysical reality of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.110" end="00:26:51.730" style="s2">the world you might say that oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.880" end="00:26:53.650" style="s2">has proves that there&#39;s that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.730" end="00:26:55.510" style="s2">your mind can see into the future this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.650" end="00:26:58.179" style="s2">proves that the future is already</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.510" end="00:26:59.250" style="s2">written or some large abstraction that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.179" end="00:27:01.570" style="s2">you&#39;re using this to come</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.250" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another approach which</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.570" end="00:27:04.870" style="s2">is the kind of approach that I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:06.940" style="s2">to talk about it and just you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.870" end="00:27:10.840" style="s2">really actually celebrate in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.940" end="00:27:12.850" style="s2">which is you just go yeah it was weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.840" end="00:27:14.350" style="s2">and you&#39;re like what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.850" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">we use the term all the time something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.350" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">oh it&#39;s weird as a weird dream weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:19.630" style="s2">person weird what are we actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:21.309" style="s2">we don&#39;t really pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.630" end="00:27:23.710" style="s2">word we don&#39;t think of it as an actual</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.309" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">category the way that real is a category</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.710" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">or the losery is a category or uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:31.809" style="s2">even as a category it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:34.950" style="s2">uncanny but it&#39;s a little bit darker a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.809" end="00:27:39.010" style="s2">little bit more materialistic in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.950" end="00:27:42.370" style="s2">material way not a not a gravity way and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.010" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">so I&#39;m really just interested in tracing</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.370" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">this among people who are having these</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:49.059" style="s2">experiences that have so many religious</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:51.970" style="s2">and mystical and cosmological elements</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.059" end="00:27:53.260" style="s2">in them that their ability some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.970" end="00:27:55.480" style="s2">time not all the time but their ability</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.260" end="00:27:58.230" style="s2">some of the time to stay grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.480" end="00:28:00.700" style="s2">that leads to what I call weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.230" end="00:28:04.570" style="s2">naturalism and what I mean by that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.700" end="00:28:06.870" style="s2">nuts will get us to Cove it is that just</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.570" end="00:28:09.820" style="s2">this world without invoking any</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.870" end="00:28:14.110" style="s2">metaphysical principles mystical things</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.820" end="00:28:16.919" style="s2">God&#39;s other dimensions just this world</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.110" end="00:28:20.980" style="s2">with you know some physics thrown in is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.919" end="00:28:23.350" style="s2">or can be weird and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:25.690" style="s2">because anomalies keep happening no</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.350" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">matter where we however we try to solve</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.690" end="00:28:29.320" style="s2">them maybe this would thing looked like</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.390" style="s2">an anomaly and then later on we learned</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.320" end="00:28:32.770" style="s2">actually wasn&#39;t you can totally be</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.390" end="00:28:37.330" style="s2">explained oh look there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.770" end="00:28:39.790" style="s2">anomaly on the horizon oh we never we</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.330" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">never transcend this character and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.790" end="00:28:43.360" style="s2">you get involved into actual anomalies</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:45.070" style="s2">that you know depending on where you sit</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.360" end="00:28:47.230" style="s2">and what you look at things that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.070" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">characterized by the paranormal or</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.230" end="00:28:50.980" style="s2">things that are characterized by high</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:53.559" style="s2">dose psychedelic experience we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.980" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">weird shit happens hard to say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.559" end="00:28:58.210" style="s2">going on here and rather than say oh</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.250" style="s2">that means there&#39;s another world or that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.210" end="00:29:02.650" style="s2">means there&#39;s the truth behind this one</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.250" end="00:29:06.340" style="s2">I just want to say no know where we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.650" end="00:29:08.230" style="s2">this place where we already are is weird</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.340" end="00:29:10.570" style="s2">and if you go looking for it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.230" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">really gonna find it and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.570" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">comes looking for you</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:18.550" style="s2">and that sense of breaking down or that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:19.930" style="s2">sense of reality shifting that can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.550" end="00:29:21.820" style="s2">produced through all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.930" end="00:29:24.820" style="s2">including conspiracy theory including</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.820" end="00:29:27.580" style="s2">you know learning and reading including</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.820" end="00:29:30.670" style="s2">having these experiences are all ways of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.580" end="00:29:33.160" style="s2">encountering the weird so today I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.670" end="00:29:37.080" style="s2">though that I mean kovat is weird in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.160" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">lot of ways because it was unexpected it</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.080" end="00:29:46.300" style="s2">is invisible but not the physiological</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">effects of it are very peculiar the as</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.300" end="00:29:49.660" style="s2">far as I can tell you know I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.280" end="00:29:51.850" style="s2">don&#39;t spend all my time trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.660" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">up on on the science but I actually know</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.850" end="00:29:55.030" style="s2">some people who do and I talked to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:56.560" style="s2">about what they&#39;re what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.030" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s extraordinary what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.560" end="00:29:59.920" style="s2">really know is is it affect the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">system maybe it&#39;s maybe it&#39;s affecting</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.920" end="00:30:03.340" style="s2">the nervous system principally and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">actually the lung stuff is only a second</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.340" end="00:30:07.540" style="s2">that you know and then the rates of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.700" style="s2">reactions and how varied they are and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.540" end="00:30:12.370" style="s2">the quality of the turnover and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.700" end="00:30:15.310" style="s2">so it&#39;s just created this I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.370" end="00:30:16.900" style="s2">really pulled the rug out from under us</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.310" end="00:30:20.590" style="s2">and then you get into all the social</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.900" end="00:30:23.920" style="s2">things the fact that we have to then</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.590" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">navigate a social reality where various</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.920" end="00:30:29.530" style="s2">authorities are both you know creating</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:32.260" style="s2">demanding specific situations about gas</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.530" end="00:30:35.680" style="s2">you know masks and closing stores and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.260" end="00:30:38.620" style="s2">all this like actual shift in our social</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.680" end="00:30:41.290" style="s2">reality but beyond that is the sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.620" end="00:30:44.590" style="s2">that we&#39;re almost inevitably in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.290" end="00:30:48.550" style="s2">conspiratorial situation we&#39;re like we</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.590" end="00:30:51.280" style="s2">have no choice but to wrestle with the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.550" end="00:30:54.790" style="s2">distinct possibility that some of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.280" end="00:30:56.200" style="s2">stuff has multiple purposes and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.790" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">that interested in that the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.200" end="00:31:00.400" style="s2">is engineered or this and that above a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.230" style="s2">blah I find it more likely that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.400" end="00:31:03.310" style="s2">something slipped out of a lab in China</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.230" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to really tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.310" end="00:31:08.800" style="s2">it but in a way that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:12.370" style="s2">you know because the the the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.800" end="00:31:14.680" style="s2">the link to the origins is usually less</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.370" end="00:31:17.170" style="s2">important to what people are how people</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.680" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">are actually weaponizing and exploiting</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.170" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">the situation as it evolves and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:23.800" style="s2">course we can see that so in order to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:26.410" style="s2">really try to understand where we are we</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.800" end="00:31:29.800" style="s2">have no choice but to kind of go into</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.410" end="00:31:32.950" style="s2">a realm of the unknown where inevitably</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.800" end="00:31:36.100" style="s2">certain kinds of patterns that are more</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.950" end="00:31:38.440" style="s2">archetypal or mythical take the stage</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.100" end="00:31:40.540" style="s2">where you start wondering about well</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.440" end="00:31:43.060" style="s2">maybe this is a kind of who would be</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.540" end="00:31:44.980" style="s2">behind it oh it&#39;s the you know the dark</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.060" end="00:31:47.500" style="s2">room with all the people in there hands</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.980" end="00:31:48.760" style="s2">on the levers manipulating things you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.500" end="00:31:50.530" style="s2">like no no it can&#39;t be that far it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.760" end="00:31:53.140" style="s2">be that for but yet there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.530" end="00:31:55.030" style="s2">kind of curious about X&amp;Y or the look</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.140" end="00:31:57.340" style="s2">how quickly we&#39;re thinking about oh I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.030" end="00:31:59.500" style="s2">can&#39;t wait for contract tracing so I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.340" end="00:32:02.350" style="s2">go out and enjoy my life and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.500" end="00:32:04.780" style="s2">well what a year ago I was already</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.350" end="00:32:06.820" style="s2">horrified with the loss of privacy that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.780" end="00:32:10.330" style="s2">we had that and now I&#39;m like looking for</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.820" end="00:32:12.520" style="s2">with it what happened to me so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.330" end="00:32:14.770" style="s2">paying attention you enter into what</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.520" end="00:32:17.080" style="s2">Wilson called a kind of Chapel perilous</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.350" end="00:32:26.290" style="s2">of your experience and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.290" end="00:32:28.780" style="s2">strongly supported sense that there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.290" end="00:32:30.820" style="s2">multiple ways of looking at the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.780" end="00:32:33.100" style="s2">that nobody really knows what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.820" end="00:32:36.160" style="s2">the no one&#39;s really driving the bus and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.100" end="00:32:40.810" style="s2">that the bus is kind of creating down</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.160" end="00:32:44.860" style="s2">the hill and so the weirdness is to not</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.810" end="00:32:47.680" style="s2">deny the peculiarity of the situation by</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.860" end="00:32:50.200" style="s2">holding on to some oh it&#39;s going to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.680" end="00:32:52.990" style="s2">back to the way it was or oh it&#39;s I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.200" end="00:32:55.180" style="s2">just trust all these agencies or what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.990" end="00:32:57.100" style="s2">get from these news feeds is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.180" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">really going on it so I can feel okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.100" end="00:33:01.510" style="s2">and you know stay calm</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:02.950" style="s2">sorry I don&#39;t think you can do that but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.510" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">what do you do then then you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.950" end="00:33:09.850" style="s2">accept that you&#39;re in this situation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:13.840" style="s2">the weird and then use practical tools</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.850" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">and your own self work as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.840" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">staying awake and sane and grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.320" end="00:33:21.190" style="s2">relationship to it but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:22.590" style="s2">weirdness is it&#39;s almost like a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:25.030" style="s2">example of it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.590" end="00:33:27.880" style="s2">metaphysical but yet people think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.030" end="00:33:29.680" style="s2">it that way you know whether they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.880" end="00:33:31.930" style="s2">think like oh it&#39;s a message from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.680" end="00:33:34.420" style="s2">from the earth you know this is the vet</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.930" end="00:33:36.970" style="s2">you know that the virus is the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.420" end="00:33:40.120" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that&#39;s waking us up or no</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.970" end="00:33:43.320" style="s2">it&#39;s this instrument of malfeasant</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.120" end="00:33:46.690" style="s2">you know New World Order you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.320" end="00:33:48.400" style="s2">transhumanist Illuminati okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.690" end="00:33:50.890" style="s2">then we&#39;re in another myth but even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.400" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">you try to stay really close to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.890" end="00:33:55.390" style="s2">facts on the ground and a really secular</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:57.430" style="s2">and grounded way and whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.390" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">also just seeing the like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.430" end="00:34:02.920" style="s2">instability of scientific knowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.900" style="s2">incapacity of all of these authorities</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.920" end="00:34:06.610" style="s2">to really handle things in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.900" end="00:34:08.260" style="s2">you would imagine that their authority</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.610" end="00:34:10.780" style="s2">in there and their training and their</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.260" end="00:34:14.950" style="s2">their public role would would illuminate</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.780" end="00:34:18.310" style="s2">so the sense of being unmoored of being</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.950" end="00:34:20.710" style="s2">a sea of scrambling like all of those</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.310" end="00:34:24.520" style="s2">are actual experiences but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.710" end="00:34:26.890" style="s2">just you like oh it&#39;s my emotions I</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.520" end="00:34:31.000" style="s2">can&#39;t handle it or I&#39;m scared or</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.890" end="00:34:34.660" style="s2">whatever no no the thing itself is going</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.000" end="00:34:40.090" style="s2">Wiggy like the actual historical moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.660" end="00:34:42.340" style="s2">is getting weird and that shifts to my</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.090" end="00:34:44.500" style="s2">mind shifts the way you experience it</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.340" end="00:34:46.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like your fault you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.500" end="00:34:48.280" style="s2">not expected to know the answer you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.930" end="00:34:49.510" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we get into this not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.280" end="00:34:51.430" style="s2">knowing thing and that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.510" end="00:34:54.040" style="s2">problems right now is that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.430" end="00:34:57.130" style="s2">so used to knowing that even people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.040" end="00:35:00.430" style="s2">have no business coming to some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.130" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">unusual conviction about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.430" end="00:35:04.990" style="s2">based on their the information they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.190" style="s2">taking in or their quality of critical</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.990" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">thought or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.190" end="00:35:11.080" style="s2">they&#39;re so convinced because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:12.820" style="s2">everybody does is what they do on the TV</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.080" end="00:35:14.650" style="s2">these you know this these got a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.820" end="00:35:16.150" style="s2">point-counterpoint they each yell at</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.650" end="00:35:19.260" style="s2">each other each trying to get each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.150" end="00:35:25.360" style="s2">on their own terms into their own axioms</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.260" end="00:35:28.180" style="s2">so being able to move through the fog of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.360" end="00:35:30.670" style="s2">war or through the fog of information</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.180" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">war without pretending it&#39;s not going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.670" end="00:35:36.280" style="s2">but also not being overwhelmed by that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:38.740" style="s2">is a very particular art that I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.280" end="00:35:41.160" style="s2">resonates very much with the sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.740" end="00:35:44.410" style="s2">making practices this not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.160" end="00:35:46.180" style="s2">practices and it&#39;s where in a way people</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.410" end="00:35:47.860" style="s2">who are drawn to this kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.180" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like this is the metal</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.860" end="00:35:53.980" style="s2">meets the road kind of thing and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:58.270" style="s2">we&#39;re actually having to do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.980" end="00:36:01.330" style="s2">and stumble through it but to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.270" end="00:36:03.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s ever more clear that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.330" end="00:36:05.050" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s another way</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.040" end="00:36:07.090" style="s2">through this kind of stuff that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.050" end="00:36:10.630" style="s2">important for at least some of us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.090" end="00:36:15.400" style="s2">keep alive because the if only because</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.630" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">the way the conviction you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.400" end="00:36:21.400" style="s2">poisons our vision of the capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:23.890" style="s2">being able to steer through this either</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.400" end="00:36:26.650" style="s2">individually or collectively because</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.890" end="00:36:28.540" style="s2">it&#39;s so concrete eyes that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.650" end="00:36:31.840" style="s2">allow any shift so you get all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.540" end="00:36:33.550" style="s2">polarizations and then restaging of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.840" end="00:36:35.950" style="s2">the fight and so now there&#39;s a fight</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.550" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">about masks and you have it on your this</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.950" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">and that it uh and you&#39;re like wow i i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:46.660" style="s2">rather say this is weird in a way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:50.350" style="s2">almost comforting i hope that makes</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.660" end="00:36:52.510" style="s2">sense we have a question that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.350" end="00:36:58.600" style="s2">can take onto that nicely Travis man you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.510" end="00:37:01.630" style="s2">had a question Eric so what is your</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.600" end="00:37:04.540" style="s2">assessment of Robert Anton Wilson legacy</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.630" end="00:37:07.180" style="s2">in terms of kind of espousing this</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.540" end="00:37:08.710" style="s2">generalized agnosticism you spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.180" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">some of the failed collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.710" end="00:37:14.490" style="s2">sense-making experiences from the 70s do</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:18.369" style="s2">you have any examples of like successes</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.490" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">in Robert Anton Wilson legacy not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.369" end="00:37:25.090" style="s2">on an individual level of coming in to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:28.530" style="s2">terms with the weirdness that we face on</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.090" end="00:37:31.240" style="s2">a daily basis but also like societally</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.530" end="00:37:34.300" style="s2">this generalized agnosticism being</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.240" end="00:37:36.040" style="s2">applied to forming groups and things of</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.300" end="00:37:39.190" style="s2">that nature those are great questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.040" end="00:37:41.470" style="s2">I&#39;ll do my best I wish I could have more</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.190" end="00:37:43.660" style="s2">on the last one that I then I think I do</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.470" end="00:37:46.690" style="s2">I think that you know the legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.660" end="00:37:48.490" style="s2">Wilson is a very interesting one because</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.690" end="00:37:49.990" style="s2">again as I was writing this I was like</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.490" end="00:37:52.660" style="s2">going more and more like whoa this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.990" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">just this is so similar to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.660" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">happening at the time I was writing in</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:38:01.630" style="s2">particular was the lead that I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">finishing around the lead up to 2 2016 2</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.630" end="00:38:07.390" style="s2">the Trump election and there was all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">you know paper the Frog</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.390" end="00:38:13.380" style="s2">stuff and all the sense that a certain</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.700" end="00:38:17.890" style="s2">kind of internet savvy prankster</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.380" end="00:38:20.170" style="s2">nihilist humor mode was being used</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.890" end="00:38:23.890" style="s2">weapon had been weaponized and was being</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.170" end="00:38:26.349" style="s2">used very forcibly in order to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.890" end="00:38:28.750" style="s2">do information warfare at least online</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.349" end="00:38:30.460" style="s2">how influential that was in the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.750" end="00:38:32.859" style="s2">very very hard to say but it clearly was</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.460" end="00:38:34.839" style="s2">got a lot of press and got people aware</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.859" end="00:38:37.180" style="s2">of it and I think it was influential in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.839" end="00:38:39.970" style="s2">in some ways and and continues to be in</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.180" end="00:38:42.339" style="s2">in different ways I think it&#39;s it never</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.970" end="00:38:45.130" style="s2">stays put it kind of changes and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.339" end="00:38:47.730" style="s2">then it breaks down and other things can</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.130" end="00:38:50.200" style="s2">absorb it and you know but it was very</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.730" end="00:38:52.089" style="s2">appointed and without going into</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.200" end="00:38:53.559" style="s2">specifics there&#39;s things about Wilson in</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.089" end="00:38:55.029" style="s2">the in the late sixties and early</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.559" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">seventies where they were doing exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.029" end="00:39:02.170" style="s2">that they were doing pranks that took</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:05.710" style="s2">advantage of other people&#39;s conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.170" end="00:39:09.069" style="s2">paranoia&#39;s in order to just fuck with</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.710" end="00:39:13.420" style="s2">them and to do it in a way not in a mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.069" end="00:39:16.869" style="s2">way in sort of a spirit of anarchic you</p>

<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:25.150" style="s2">create room and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.190" end="00:40:54.730" style="s2">seriously that was also very serious so</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.340" end="00:40:58.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a subtle set of feelings and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.730" end="00:41:00.630" style="s2">and and expressions that in the late 60s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.060" end="00:41:04.330" style="s2">definitely had a role I mean part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.630" end="00:41:07.150" style="s2">political protest in this late 60s had</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.330" end="00:41:09.940" style="s2">this like prankster open-ended kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.150" end="00:41:13.750" style="s2">quality to it but it doesn&#39;t really lead</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.940" end="00:41:15.730" style="s2">itself lend itself very well to let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.730" end="00:41:21.700" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the point and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.840" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">the ways you can demonstrate that with</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.700" end="00:41:25.210" style="s2">with particularly Robert Anton Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:26.680" style="s2">stuff and the kind of pranks they did is</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.210" end="00:41:28.750" style="s2">you&#39;re like you don&#39;t really have a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.680" end="00:41:31.690" style="s2">example of that kind of pranking</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.750" end="00:41:33.730" style="s2">attitude you have some with the Church</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.690" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">of the SubGenius they kind of carried it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:37.780" style="s2">forward it was a little bit less</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.200" style="s2">political in some ways or that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.780" end="00:41:42.070" style="s2">targets were easier making fun of</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.200" end="00:41:44.580" style="s2">Christianity you know making but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.070" end="00:41:47.110" style="s2">know but it it still had that anarchic</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.580" end="00:41:49.960" style="s2">open-ended humorous but but you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.110" end="00:41:52.360" style="s2">politically informed quality to it but</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.960" end="00:41:55.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not really till you get to the flip</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.360" end="00:41:59.170" style="s2">side of you know the meme magic</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.780" end="00:42:01.000" style="s2">all right guys in in 2015-2016</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.170" end="00:42:03.700" style="s2">that you actually see something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.000" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">that political except now it&#39;s from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.700" end="00:42:08.620" style="s2">other side you know they were anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:11.530" style="s2">so there was always some libertarian you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.620" end="00:42:13.300" style="s2">know anti state attitudes inside Robert</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.530" end="00:42:15.880" style="s2">Anton Wilson stuff so it&#39;s not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.300" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">not just figures of the left but still</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.880" end="00:42:20.230" style="s2">there would they would have nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.500" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">do with this kind of monster or in a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.230" end="00:42:25.000" style="s2">sorry should I&#39;m falling into a myth but</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:27.100" style="s2">uh that kind of that kind of activity</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.000" end="00:42:29.260" style="s2">and yet there you are looking at its</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.100" end="00:42:30.520" style="s2">logic so as somebody who&#39;s like a Robert</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.260" end="00:42:32.080" style="s2">Anton Wilson fan and thinks he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.520" end="00:42:34.180" style="s2">important thinks he&#39;s even politically</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.080" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">important I got a deal with that and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.180" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:42.070" style="s2">because I know again it&#39;s that I I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:44.050" style="s2">I hate to say this because it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.070" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">conclusion that I want to either believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.050" end="00:42:49.030" style="s2">or even have to reckon with but I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">think that some of this stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.030" end="00:42:56.080" style="s2">talking about it just doesn&#39;t work on a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:58.110" style="s2">large scale and so you will you get back</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.080" end="00:43:01.120" style="s2">into that thing of they&#39;re sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.110" end="00:43:04.270" style="s2">secret schools but just sort of under</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.120" end="00:43:08.520" style="s2">the radar nodes of ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.270" end="00:43:12.070" style="s2">reality that they have a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.520" end="00:43:15.160" style="s2">tentativeness and an acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.070" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">ambiguity and acceptance of multiplicity</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.160" end="00:43:19.720" style="s2">that isn&#39;t like powerlessness it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.410" end="00:43:21.790" style="s2">like postmodern relativism or like oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.720" end="00:43:23.740" style="s2">everybody&#39;s story is equal nobody knows</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.790" end="00:43:27.010" style="s2">someone I talk about at all but it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.740" end="00:43:30.310" style="s2">acknowledge a kind of a power of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.010" end="00:43:33.070" style="s2">multiple viewpoints that most political</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.310" end="00:43:36.250" style="s2">parties most people shrink away from</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.070" end="00:43:38.530" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to deal with that and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.250" end="00:43:40.120" style="s2">I when I when you ask about what are</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.530" end="00:43:43.360" style="s2">these forms that it could take that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.120" end="00:43:46.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t just individual that are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.360" end="00:43:48.790" style="s2">what like this is which is a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.360" end="00:43:50.680" style="s2">kind of tentative node off to the side</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.790" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">where the individuals involved are</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.680" end="00:43:54.670" style="s2">plugged into some pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:57.250" style="s2">things but they tend to also be further</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.670" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">networks of this kind of interest ease</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.250" end="00:44:02.170" style="s2">place rather than something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.880" style="s2">coalesce is and coheres in a very</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.170" end="00:44:06.730" style="s2">obvious way such that it could become</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.880" end="00:44:09.430" style="s2">another obvious mimetic tribe and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.730" end="00:44:12.300" style="s2">both its strength and its weakness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.430" end="00:44:15.460" style="s2">like you can wake up in the midst of any</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.300" end="00:44:17.650" style="s2">historical situation but the terms that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.460" end="00:44:19.690" style="s2">you&#39;re waking up in may not be</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.650" end="00:44:21.880" style="s2">translatable to the majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.690" end="00:44:23.410" style="s2">who are going on in that situation so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.880" end="00:44:27.850" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in how waking up</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.410" end="00:44:30.130" style="s2">applies and is live through a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.850" end="00:44:34.300" style="s2">historical transition or transformation</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.130" end="00:44:36.460" style="s2">or breakdown or whatever it&#39;s tough you</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.300" end="00:44:41.350" style="s2">know I want to say that that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.460" end="00:44:43.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know what was the what was</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.350" end="00:44:44.680" style="s2">that phrase let me just look over here</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.090" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">oh yeah the whole idea of the invisible</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.680" end="00:44:48.690" style="s2">college so the idea of the invisible</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">college which is sort of a motif and</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.690" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">some you know conspiracy theories to was</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:56.849" style="s2">a way that the Royal Society first</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:59.010" style="s2">started to refer to itself in the 17th</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.849" end="00:45:00.630" style="s2">century in the early 17th century when</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.010" end="00:45:03.060" style="s2">the Rosicrucians were happening and like</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.630" end="00:45:05.130" style="s2">science hadn&#39;t quite crystallized as</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.060" end="00:45:07.290" style="s2">like an alternate form of belief and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.130" end="00:45:09.510" style="s2">was still embedded in kind of esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.290" end="00:45:10.980" style="s2">ideas but people were sensing that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.510" end="00:45:12.420" style="s2">were moving out of the Middle Ages that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.980" end="00:45:14.099" style="s2">there were new forms of government that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.420" end="00:45:15.510" style="s2">were coming something about reason was</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.099" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">letting things happen it was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.510" end="00:45:19.530" style="s2">transition point a liminal point and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:21.089" style="s2">idea of an invisible College is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.530" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">there&#39;s you&#39;re sort of like you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.089" end="00:45:26.430" style="s2">colleagues everywhere it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:28.500" style="s2">visible you are engaged in an active</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.430" end="00:45:31.470" style="s2">political life but it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.500" end="00:45:33.930" style="s2">Massa fight doesn&#39;t it sounds obvious in</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.470" end="00:45:34.619" style="s2">a way and it sets the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.930" end="00:45:36.780" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.619" end="00:45:39.450" style="s2">and you know I think that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.780" end="00:45:41.940" style="s2">really good thing to remember when</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.450" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling lost or when you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:50.550" style="s2">help you know is that you you can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.880" end="00:45:53.599" style="s2">how these very tentative relationships</p>

<p begin="00:46:00.690" end="00:46:05.819" style="s2">think in some fundamental ways 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.540" end="00:46:07.140" style="s2">down the line or whatever I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.819" end="00:46:08.369" style="s2">want to get into all the different</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.140" end="00:46:10.740" style="s2">things that could be happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.369" end="00:46:13.380" style="s2">future but because it&#39;s so oppressive</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.740" end="00:46:16.710" style="s2">and overwhelming but I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.380" end="00:46:19.819" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very good to honor the tiny</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.710" end="00:46:22.230" style="s2">little bit that you&#39;re doing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.819" end="00:46:24.630" style="s2">you know in a way it&#39;s almost like being</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.230" end="00:46:26.460" style="s2">in a you know if there&#39;s like a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.630" end="00:46:28.770" style="s2">teacher around you and this is someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.460" end="00:46:31.770" style="s2">who&#39;s like they&#39;re on it they got the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.770" end="00:46:33.030" style="s2">goods like they&#39;re you know whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.770" end="00:46:34.560" style="s2">think about it religiously or</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.030" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">philosophically but someone who&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.560" end="00:46:40.380" style="s2">like a wise person and he or she is</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.640" style="s2">creating a scene where people go but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.380" end="00:46:43.349" style="s2">know if you go to these things you look</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.640" end="00:46:45.240" style="s2">around like a lot of people therefore</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.349" end="00:46:47.190" style="s2">kind of weird reasons and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.240" end="00:46:49.170" style="s2">aren&#39;t so smart and some of them are are</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.190" end="00:46:50.670" style="s2">kind of gossipy and so you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.170" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">with and then you&#39;re not even sure why</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.670" end="00:46:52.380" style="s2">you&#39;re there like why am I really being</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:53.940" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.380" end="00:46:56.490" style="s2">and you can you can say oh this is all</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.940" end="00:46:58.680" style="s2">just kind of pointless but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.490" end="00:47:01.619" style="s2">like the way like wisdom you know isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.680" end="00:47:02.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t manifest on the front page so it</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.619" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.190" end="00:47:07.590" style="s2">quality of kind of through the cracks</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:10.410" style="s2">and it may not help but it kind of also</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.590" end="00:47:12.060" style="s2">has to be what it is and so I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.410" end="00:47:15.360" style="s2">this kind of thing that you&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.060" end="00:47:17.430" style="s2">to it almost inevitably has that quality</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.360" end="00:47:20.340" style="s2">to it and that the best thing we can do</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.430" end="00:47:23.340" style="s2">is to keep being is robustly collective</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.340" end="00:47:26.130" style="s2">and connected as we can be to not sort</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.340" end="00:47:27.900" style="s2">of just give up and become a monad to</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.130" end="00:47:30.930" style="s2">stay in body but also stay in body</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.900" end="00:47:34.080" style="s2">together even if it&#39;s just 30 people on</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.930" end="00:47:36.450" style="s2">a zoom call or whatever that this is it</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.080" end="00:47:39.270" style="s2">in a way for this right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.450" end="00:47:41.670" style="s2">and to be okay with that degree of des</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.270" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">centeredness even though it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.670" end="00:47:47.820" style="s2">obviously not sufficient to you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">fight back systemic racism or meted you</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.820" end="00:47:52.290" style="s2">know narratives being crammed on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.200" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">throat from the CDC or from Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.290" end="00:47:56.520" style="s2">or from The Kooks on on cue and on or</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.900" end="00:47:58.830" style="s2">whatever it is it&#39;s like it&#39;s this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.520" end="00:48:01.920" style="s2">drop in the bucket but it&#39;s also where</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.830" end="00:48:08.100" style="s2">we are and and so I hope I hope that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.920" end="00:48:10.590" style="s2">sum provide something so we have about</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.100" end="00:48:12.540" style="s2">10 minute or eight minutes I think we</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.590" end="00:48:14.700" style="s2">can sneak in another question Eric yes</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.540" end="00:48:16.680" style="s2">is okay if we go over a little bit or do</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.700" end="00:48:20.340" style="s2">we get this answer this question then</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.680" end="00:48:22.110" style="s2">wrap it up great okay Lisa Norton you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.340" end="00:48:24.840" style="s2">had a question about Mark Fisher which I</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.110" end="00:48:29.250" style="s2">was kind of interested in trying to meet</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.840" end="00:48:31.290" style="s2">yourself and asking yeah Eric thank you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.250" end="00:48:32.970" style="s2">apologies I haven&#39;t read your new book</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.290" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">but I was wondering if you connected</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.970" end="00:48:39.030" style="s2">your how you Square or orient your</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:41.310" style="s2">notion of weirdness to people like Mark</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.030" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">Fischer&#39;s the weird and the eerie or</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.310" end="00:48:48.630" style="s2">some of the people like Levy Bryant or</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:50.940" style="s2">Timothy Martin great thanks for that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.630" end="00:48:54.120" style="s2">question that&#39;s a nice that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.940" end="00:48:56.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a good one because I got Fisher</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.120" end="00:48:58.470" style="s2">stuff relatively late into the writing</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.490" end="00:49:01.020" style="s2">but I did manage to find some very</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.470" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">wonderful overlaps that were really</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.020" end="00:49:06.810" style="s2">really really important to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">the the main one that really helped me</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.810" end="00:49:10.410" style="s2">is the difference which I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:14.610" style="s2">in the introduction between the uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.410" end="00:49:15.390" style="s2">and the weird and the uncanny is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.610" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.390" end="00:49:19.319" style="s2">more like acceptable notions certainly</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:21.150" style="s2">in academia it&#39;s kind of like already</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.319" end="00:49:22.740" style="s2">has it sort of Zone in a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.150" end="00:49:27.589" style="s2">weird doesn&#39;t I think there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.740" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">some really concrete issues of you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.589" end="00:49:33.000" style="s2">demographics and and cultural class</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.940" style="s2">behind that the weird is a lowbrow form</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.000" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">the uncanny is a higher brow form but</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.940" end="00:49:41.579" style="s2">more importantly is that that is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:44.039" style="s2">the uncanny is essentially psychological</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.579" end="00:49:47.700" style="s2">so the way that Fisher talks about it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.039" end="00:49:51.960" style="s2">he says the uncanny all ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.700" end="00:49:54.299" style="s2">refers in its the internal family drama</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.960" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s left its trace that then is</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.299" end="00:50:01.140" style="s2">discovered again in exteriority whereas</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:03.930" style="s2">the weird is the relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.140" end="00:50:06.390" style="s2">outside and that difference for me is</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.930" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">totally key I mean it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.390" end="00:50:14.099" style="s2">is that the weird is not just my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:17.789" style="s2">the weird is of a tenor an ambiance of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.099" end="00:50:21.690" style="s2">relation to an outside or an other that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.789" end="00:50:23.369" style="s2">is ultimately unassimilable and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.690" end="00:50:25.349" style="s2">where it gets into the triple o stuff</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.369" end="00:50:27.630" style="s2">which is also very much a part of it I I</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.349" end="00:50:29.819" style="s2">got to hang out with Morton a buncha at</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.630" end="00:50:32.299" style="s2">Rice and I read it a lot of those guys</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.819" end="00:50:35.099" style="s2">and I loved it it was like the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.299" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">kind of philosophical discovery that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.099" end="00:50:38.609" style="s2">had had in many many years where I felt</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:41.130" style="s2">oh yeah this is this stuff is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.609" end="00:50:42.809" style="s2">really good for what I&#39;m doing even if</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.130" end="00:50:44.640" style="s2">I&#39;m doing it you directing it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.809" end="00:50:47.579" style="s2">somewhat different direct different</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.640" end="00:50:49.559" style="s2">directions and there again what I really</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.579" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">appreciate when they talk my whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.559" end="00:50:53.670" style="s2">about weird naturalism is not that</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:57.269" style="s2">different than weird essentialism that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.670" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">that Morton talks about and not spacing</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.269" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">it&#39;s named the guy who teaches in North</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">Africa why am I forgetting is name</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:08.670" style="s2">anyway and the idea there is just that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:10.829" style="s2">we are in a we are really in a world of</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.670" end="00:51:12.450" style="s2">objects there are real things everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.829" end="00:51:15.299" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an illusion in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.450" end="00:51:17.460" style="s2">it&#39;s not just some you know my</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.299" end="00:51:19.950" style="s2">expression of Maya and those kind of old</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.460" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">mystical psychedelic ideas which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.950" end="00:51:24.089" style="s2">think are very helpful anymore we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:26.519" style="s2">actually embedded in all sorts of you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.089" end="00:51:28.780" style="s2">know real networks with relationality</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.519" end="00:51:31.060" style="s2">with all of these objects on many many</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.780" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">four levels of scale but that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.060" end="00:51:37.720" style="s2">essential opacity to those objects so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:39.580" style="s2">we&#39;re in this weird situation where</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.720" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">we&#39;re in relationship with something we</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.580" end="00:51:43.360" style="s2">can never capture with our</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:46.210" style="s2">representations that can never be</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.360" end="00:51:49.810" style="s2">perfectly translated but it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.210" end="00:51:51.940" style="s2">an isolated reflectivity we&#39;re all I</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.810" end="00:51:53.950" style="s2">have is my own projections that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.940" end="00:51:56.770" style="s2">the difference is is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.950" end="00:51:58.600" style="s2">something like an encounter it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.770" end="00:52:01.120" style="s2">that the encounter can&#39;t be adequately</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.600" end="00:52:02.980" style="s2">represented and it can&#39;t be captured and</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.120" end="00:52:04.270" style="s2">it can&#39;t be entirely directed and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.980" end="00:52:05.770" style="s2">way that&#39;s part of its strength</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.270" end="00:52:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly part of its political</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.770" end="00:52:10.600" style="s2">strength and say it&#39;s ecological</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.110" end="00:52:13.240" style="s2">strength is we have to really open up to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.600" end="00:52:16.210" style="s2">the fact that we are embedded in objects</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.240" end="00:52:18.070" style="s2">and hyper objects that are so far beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.210" end="00:52:20.590" style="s2">our capacity even collectively to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.070" end="00:52:23.020" style="s2">understand and yet we have to act from</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.590" end="00:52:26.560" style="s2">that responsibility and that awareness</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.020" end="00:52:28.300" style="s2">and the way that I take that in my kind</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.560" end="00:52:30.700" style="s2">of more visionary and psychedelic way in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.300" end="00:52:33.300" style="s2">the book is to talk about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.700" end="00:52:37.780" style="s2">happening in extraordinary experience is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.300" end="00:52:40.030" style="s2">something like this encounter where even</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.780" end="00:52:42.070" style="s2">the projections don&#39;t really aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.030" end="00:52:45.580" style="s2">really adequate anymore and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.070" end="00:52:48.160" style="s2">remains unassimilable so it doesn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.580" end="00:52:50.020" style="s2">you a revelation so the minute you go</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.020" end="00:52:54.370" style="s2">psychedelic people oh I talk to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.090" end="00:52:57.010" style="s2">mind of the of the planet and it told me</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.370" end="00:52:59.530" style="s2">that the covet is part of a healing</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.010" end="00:53:02.110" style="s2">process like no you&#39;ve already lost it</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.100" end="00:53:13.540" style="s2">initiates and that that&#39;s our weird</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.170" end="00:53:16.360" style="s2">situation and we have to move within</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.540" end="00:53:20.470" style="s2">that both the limitations and I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.360" end="00:53:22.000" style="s2">the openness of that situation so again</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.470" end="00:53:26.410" style="s2">and again it&#39;s like relationships to</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.410" end="00:53:31.510" style="s2">historical material conditions but also</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.990" end="00:53:34.330" style="s2">to recognizing the fundamental weirdness</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.510" end="00:53:37.270" style="s2">in that relation that also offers room</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.330" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">to maneuver that a strict determinism or</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.270" end="00:53:41.860" style="s2">a strict physicalism doesn&#39;t at all and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">you know I guess we could talk more</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.860" end="00:53:45.460" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:47.140" style="s2">triple o and how different flavors go in</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.140" end="00:53:52.779" style="s2">around determinism around you know human</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.920" end="00:53:55.059" style="s2">psychic activity and it does it have any</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.779" end="00:53:56.740" style="s2">purpose and and things like that but uh</p>

<p begin="00:55:01.329" end="00:55:06.660" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s always the sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:10.420" style="s2">that there&#39;s something indulgent or</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.660" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">narcissistic or deluded about spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.420" end="00:55:14.380" style="s2">work or philosophical spirit what</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.619" end="00:55:21.490" style="s2">with your neuroses and get over with it</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.490" end="00:55:29.020" style="s2">stuff and I you know and sort of a not</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.559" end="00:55:32.289" style="s2">you know not necessarily a happy news</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.020" end="00:55:34.270" style="s2">way but that the value of that work in</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.289" end="00:55:36.789" style="s2">my life and in the people around me who</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.270" end="00:55:38.529" style="s2">seem awake now that I can have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.789" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">conversation with it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.529" end="00:55:43.180" style="s2">conversation almost invariably means</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:46.299" style="s2">there&#39;s something like that going on in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.180" end="00:55:50.920" style="s2">their life too so to me it&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.299" end="00:55:55.059" style="s2">the the concrete payoff value of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.920" end="00:55:56.110" style="s2">kind of work at a time like this and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.059" end="00:55:57.880" style="s2">saying that it came</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.110" end="00:55:59.530" style="s2">you know it can lead you foul to of one</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.880" end="00:56:02.590" style="s2">little side note just because we talked</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.530" end="00:56:05.470" style="s2">about cue and on it&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.590" end="00:56:07.540" style="s2">that I had been very I&#39;ve been paying a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.470" end="00:56:10.080" style="s2">lot of tension to it recently what there</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.540" end="00:56:12.700" style="s2">was that there was a noticeable uptick</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.080" end="00:56:14.830" style="s2">noticed by me and many other people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.700" end="00:56:17.110" style="s2">I know personally and observers and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.830" end="00:56:19.330" style="s2">other people I didn&#39;t know who reflected</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.110" end="00:56:22.270" style="s2">on it a noticeable uptick in the last</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.330" end="00:56:25.630" style="s2">couple of months among alternative</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.270" end="00:56:27.820" style="s2">medicine yoga psychedelic Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.630" end="00:56:32.890" style="s2">those that kind of those kind of zones</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.820" end="00:56:34.270" style="s2">of straight-up cueing on myth many often</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.890" end="00:56:36.850" style="s2">times they didn&#39;t even know what it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.270" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">and I was like whoa something has</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.850" end="00:56:42.820" style="s2">happened so obviously a lot of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:45.310" style="s2">of spiritual stuff can can you know go</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.820" end="00:56:46.900" style="s2">awry and in a variety of ways and in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.310" end="00:56:49.690" style="s2">way the history of the seventies is all</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.900" end="00:56:52.830" style="s2">you need to know to show that but that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.690" end="00:56:55.300" style="s2">this particular quality of adding a</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.830" end="00:56:59.860" style="s2">philosophical self-reflection and a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.300" end="00:57:02.140" style="s2">certain kind of logic of sort of self</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.860" end="00:57:05.370" style="s2">work I don&#39;t want to say self-control</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.140" end="00:57:08.170" style="s2">but some of that kind of willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.370" end="00:57:10.840" style="s2">limit and constrain certain aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.170" end="00:57:13.000" style="s2">the self in light of other demands and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.840" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">in playing with that some of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.000" end="00:57:18.520" style="s2">discipline as part of a way of going</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:21.430" style="s2">deeper into the mystery rather than that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.520" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">it just arranging an individual self</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.430" end="00:57:25.990" style="s2">that these practices are really helpful</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:28.330" style="s2">right now they&#39;re really good and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.990" end="00:57:31.890" style="s2">we need them and that through them we</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.330" end="00:57:34.810" style="s2">can also form kinds of collectivities</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.890" end="00:57:38.610" style="s2">and relationships and conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.810" end="00:57:43.660" style="s2">just have a coherence and an honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.610" end="00:57:45.520" style="s2">you know a kind of what is it as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.660" end="00:57:48.310" style="s2">like you know in a way the the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.520" end="00:57:51.790" style="s2">quality of the the warrior quality of</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.310" end="00:57:54.970" style="s2">being a you know awake and staring your</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.790" end="00:57:58.030" style="s2">fear in its face it&#39;s like we have like</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.970" end="00:58:00.910" style="s2">fear confusion but there&#39;s that same</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.030" end="00:58:02.860" style="s2">like just get up stand up again okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.910" end="00:58:05.860" style="s2">there hope you felt get up it got up</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.860" end="00:58:09.230" style="s2">again that kind of practice or that kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.860" end="00:58:11.390" style="s2">of discipline seems really key right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.230" end="00:58:13.070" style="s2">and so you know I really appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.390" end="00:58:14.840" style="s2">way that you and your communities are</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.070" end="00:58:18.140" style="s2">weaving these things together as well</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.840" end="00:58:20.350" style="s2">yeah yeah and my sense is as stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.140" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">could have a role in helping with this</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.350" end="00:58:23.930" style="s2">so in a moment if you can stay around</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:25.790" style="s2">for just one more minute you can listen</p>
