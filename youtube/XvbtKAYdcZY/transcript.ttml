<p begin="00:04:27.110" end="00:04:35.080" style="s2">question where we were gathered around</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:39.229" style="s2">the theme apprehending the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.080" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">loosely to gather this conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.229" end="00:04:45.200" style="s2">I&#39;d like to begin by asking each of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:49.090" style="s2">what is the transcendent what does it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.200" end="00:04:53.570" style="s2">mean for something to be transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.090" end="00:04:56.020" style="s2">well if you let me start I take a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.570" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">position which I attribute also to Kant</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.020" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">that that we have a very clear negative</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:05.270" style="s2">understanding of it we as it were</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">advanced to the edge of our thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.270" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">so many areas knowing that although</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing further that we can say</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">that somehow the truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:21.160" style="s2">nevertheless not run out and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.630" end="00:05:23.510" style="s2">negative view I think needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.160" end="00:05:26.030" style="s2">combined with a more positive view which</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.510" end="00:05:28.130" style="s2">tells us that there are other ways not</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.030" end="00:05:32.480" style="s2">just maybe not thinking but some other</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.130" end="00:05:33.920" style="s2">way of crossing that boundary and as it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.480" end="00:05:36.410" style="s2">were landing in the realm of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.920" end="00:05:39.830" style="s2">transcendent and knowing it from inside</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.410" end="00:05:42.380" style="s2">I think you know and that this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.830" end="00:05:44.930" style="s2">something that we understand very</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.380" end="00:05:49.340" style="s2">quickly in personal relations you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.930" end="00:05:52.130" style="s2">that when I when I address you I know</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.340" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">that I&#39;m addressing something which</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.130" end="00:05:57.260" style="s2">addresses me too but from a place where</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:06:00.170" style="s2">I could never be I couldn&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.260" end="00:06:02.300" style="s2">myself from those eyes and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.170" end="00:06:04.640" style="s2">capture the thing that is looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.300" end="00:06:07.010" style="s2">from those eyes but nevertheless there</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:08.420" style="s2">are leaps of the imagination which can</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.010" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">put me in your point of view</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.420" end="00:06:15.320" style="s2">and from that point view I can come to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:17.510" style="s2">understand exactly what I am but in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.320" end="00:06:19.220" style="s2">completely different way from simply the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.510" end="00:06:21.650" style="s2">ordinary empirical knowledge that I have</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.220" end="00:06:23.720" style="s2">of myself and I think that that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.650" end="00:06:28.310" style="s2">interpersonal understanding I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">we can adapt to all the other aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.310" end="00:06:35.560" style="s2">our world which are mysterious to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">music for instance that&#39;s a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.560" end="00:06:41.420" style="s2">and I want to return to music a bit a</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:46.510" style="s2">bit later Jordan I think it&#39;s useful as</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.420" end="00:06:50.120" style="s2">an adjunct to that so so Sir Roger</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.510" end="00:06:52.820" style="s2">mentioned that the transcendent is what</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.120" end="00:06:55.100" style="s2">we bump up against when we realize our</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.820" end="00:06:57.290" style="s2">ignorance and so it&#39;s that which</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:07:00.140" style="s2">transcends our ignorance and and that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.290" end="00:07:02.690" style="s2">itself makes it an implacable fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.140" end="00:07:05.180" style="s2">unless you believe that you have no</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.690" end="00:07:09.230" style="s2">ignorance in which case there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.180" end="00:07:11.090" style="s2">in furthering a discussion with you so</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.230" end="00:07:12.950" style="s2">the transcendent is the fact insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:14.570" style="s2">it&#39;s that which transcends our ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.950" end="00:07:17.870" style="s2">but you can also think about it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.570" end="00:07:18.920" style="s2">technically so and and and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.870" end="00:07:21.680" style="s2">know enough about how the brain works</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.920" end="00:07:23.540" style="s2">now so that not that we know much so</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.680" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">that useful things can be said about</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.540" end="00:07:29.950" style="s2">that I you tend to represent</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.590" end="00:07:32.950" style="s2">the world in the simplest manner that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.950" end="00:07:35.050" style="s2">you possibly can that works for what</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.950" end="00:07:38.290" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and so you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.050" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">see the world you see sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.290" end="00:07:44.170" style="s2">useful low represent low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:46.330" style="s2">representations of the world and if they</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.170" end="00:07:48.190" style="s2">work then that&#39;s fine there&#39;s no need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.330" end="00:07:50.350" style="s2">adjust them and they&#39;re relatively easy</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.190" end="00:07:51.940" style="s2">to remember and to manipulate but now</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.350" end="00:07:54.610" style="s2">and then you have a misapprehension</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.940" end="00:07:55.990" style="s2">about someone let&#39;s say and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.610" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">conversation with them and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.990" end="00:08:00.730" style="s2">conversation goes sideways and what that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:02.500" style="s2">means is that the the thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.730" end="00:08:03.790" style="s2">thought you were conversing with is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.500" end="00:08:06.880" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re conversing with</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.790" end="00:08:08.350" style="s2">and that manifests itself in error right</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.880" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">so error is the place where the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.350" end="00:08:13.810" style="s2">transcendent reveals itself and what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:16.150" style="s2">actually revealing itself is the reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.810" end="00:08:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s outside and underneath your</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.150" end="00:08:21.640" style="s2">perceptions and so what you see in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.910" end="00:08:24.340" style="s2">world in some sense is a set of animated</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.640" end="00:08:26.350" style="s2">cartoons and a lot of that is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.340" end="00:08:27.820" style="s2">consequence of you seeing nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.350" end="00:08:30.130" style="s2">your memory because your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.820" end="00:08:31.930" style="s2">organized so that instead of going</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.130" end="00:08:34.930" style="s2">through all of the difficulty of having</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.930" end="00:08:37.060" style="s2">to look at the thing in itself you look</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.930" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">at what you assume to be there and if</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.060" end="00:08:39.070" style="s2">you can get away with that so much the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.670" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.070" end="00:08:45.670" style="s2">but the thing in itself is always much</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.840" end="00:09:05.620" style="s2">some degree because you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:07.780" style="s2">there&#39;s an element to the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.620" end="00:09:09.880" style="s2">that instills people with a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.780" end="00:09:13.150" style="s2">religious significance you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.880" end="00:09:15.190" style="s2">by immediately scientifically by feeding</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.150" end="00:09:17.980" style="s2">people chemicals for example that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.190" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">disrupt the inhibition of perception by</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.980" end="00:09:21.850" style="s2">memory and then that puts them in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">place where the transcendent tends to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.850" end="00:09:26.680" style="s2">reveal itself sometimes an overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:29.710" style="s2">force so this it&#39;s not some fiction that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.680" end="00:09:31.660" style="s2">this exists it&#39;s the what&#39;s transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.710" end="00:09:33.700" style="s2">is more real than the reality that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.660" end="00:09:35.590" style="s2">perceive well let&#39;s pick let&#39;s pick up</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.700" end="00:09:38.500" style="s2">on that because the the the ancients in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.590" end="00:09:39.820" style="s2">the medieval had a clear sense that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.500" end="00:09:42.400" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the world that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.820" end="00:09:46.660" style="s2">it was we ourselves as we make an ascent</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.400" end="00:09:49.120" style="s2">towards deeper truths higher forms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.660" end="00:09:51.280" style="s2">the beautiful as we ourselves become</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.120" end="00:09:54.610" style="s2">more self-conscious so it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.280" end="00:09:57.070" style="s2">world that&#39;s changing but but us I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.610" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">wonder if we could say how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.070" end="00:10:02.050" style="s2">understand the nature of that ascent</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:06.660" style="s2">that that that that that movement and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.050" end="00:10:10.420" style="s2">and what brings it about well I I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.660" end="00:10:14.200" style="s2">be a bit wary of the metaphor of ascent</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.420" end="00:10:16.870" style="s2">you know I I think in Plato it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.200" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">clear what he meant he wanted us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.870" end="00:10:20.650" style="s2">actually to transcend our earthly</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">perceptions and our earthly way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.650" end="00:10:26.860" style="s2">seeing things and look on the world from</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">from a God&#39;s eye perspective and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.860" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">could be done if we enter the world of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:37.300" style="s2">the pure forms and so on leave empirical</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:39.130" style="s2">reality behind I think actually insofar</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.300" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">as the experience of the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.130" end="00:10:44.680" style="s2">that I as I understand it is available</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.560" end="00:10:47.650" style="s2">to us modern people it&#39;s not that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.680" end="00:10:49.330" style="s2">that we get it perhaps about Sir Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.650" end="00:10:52.210" style="s2">might be right that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.330" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">drug-induced experiences where things</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.210" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">open up to us because old barriers are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">suddenly swept away but in my own case</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">it is the concentration on the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:09.150" style="s2">reality which at a certain point flips</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">from mere sensory understanding to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.150" end="00:11:15.160" style="s2">vision in that of its communicating</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:18.760" style="s2">something to me and I think this is what</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.160" end="00:11:21.640" style="s2">the literature and art and music do at</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.760" end="00:11:24.660" style="s2">their best they they read ascribe</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.640" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">reality so that it is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.660" end="00:11:30.280" style="s2">communicating something to you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">just there as an inert object before you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.280" end="00:11:36.660" style="s2">and that sense of the transcendence is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:40.090" style="s2">like discovering yourself in a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.660" end="00:11:41.980" style="s2">seeing in the world as a whole that</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.090" end="00:11:45.310" style="s2">thing in you that you could never</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.980" end="00:11:48.850" style="s2">identify in words you know the subject</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.310" end="00:11:50.470" style="s2">which is looking at it and it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.850" end="00:11:53.110" style="s2">mystic mystery but it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.470" end="00:11:54.700" style="s2">you can&#39;t then explain the different</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.110" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">between a good writer and a bad writer</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.700" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">of course is that a good writer will</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:02.140" style="s2">describe something in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:05.740" style="s2">the thing described has the soul of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.140" end="00:12:07.480" style="s2">reader in it so so that might be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.740" end="00:12:09.670" style="s2">distinction in part between the thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.480" end="00:12:11.339" style="s2">and the meaningful thing right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.670" end="00:12:14.529" style="s2">that&#39;s a miss that&#39;s a very mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.339" end="00:12:16.060" style="s2">phenomenon in fact in some sense the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.529" end="00:12:18.550" style="s2">essence of phenomenon because that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.060" end="00:12:20.829" style="s2">to shine forth no as we&#39;re surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.550" end="00:12:22.630" style="s2">empirical facts they&#39;re everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.829" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">there&#39;s more of them than we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.630" end="00:12:26.920" style="s2">possibly count but some of them do</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:29.500" style="s2">emerge and manifest themselves as that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.920" end="00:12:30.970" style="s2">as that conjunction between the factual</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.500" end="00:12:32.850" style="s2">and the meaningful and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.970" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">what&#39;s gripping and if you&#39;re fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.850" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">I mean to me that&#39;s also partly what</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:40.660" style="s2">what leads us onward and maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:43.000" style="s2">something approximating the ascent that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.660" end="00:12:45.220" style="s2">you described is that the set of facts</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.000" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">manifests itself as implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.220" end="00:12:49.750" style="s2">meaningful and that means in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">that there is a call to you that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.750" end="00:12:54.040" style="s2">from within you I mean I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:56.200" style="s2">else to put it exactly because your walk</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.040" end="00:12:59.860" style="s2">into a bookstore in a book will will</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">will reveal itself to you you know or or</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.860" end="00:13:03.339" style="s2">you have a conversation and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:05.350" style="s2">conversation will trigger something in</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.339" end="00:13:07.240" style="s2">you or you&#39;re reading a scientific paper</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.350" end="00:13:08.589" style="s2">and much of its dull and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.240" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">sudden there&#39;s something that sparks</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.589" end="00:13:12.699" style="s2">outward that&#39;s like a port that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:14.170" style="s2">portal into the transcendent and that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.699" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">a place where the fact and the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.170" end="00:13:18.370" style="s2">converge and that&#39;s a phenomena we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:20.620" style="s2">understand very well it has something to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.370" end="00:13:22.690" style="s2">do with its convergence with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.620" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">narrative that drives us whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.690" end="00:13:26.949" style="s2">happens to be yeah I think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:31.750" style="s2">way of putting it actually it connects</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.949" end="00:13:35.290" style="s2">with the general problem of what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.750" end="00:13:37.420" style="s2">humanities are in the university I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.290" end="00:13:40.600" style="s2">always assumed that in some way or</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.420" end="00:13:42.940" style="s2">another if you&#39;re teaching literature or</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.600" end="00:13:45.940" style="s2">musicology or or history of art or</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.940" end="00:13:49.660" style="s2">anything you are opening young people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.940" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">those moments when the world ceases to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.660" end="00:13:56.610" style="s2">be a mere accumulation of facts and as</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:59.949" style="s2">it were addresses you and that requires</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.610" end="00:14:02.920" style="s2">literary criticism it requires opening</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.949" end="00:14:05.649" style="s2">yourself to experience in a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.920" end="00:14:07.959" style="s2">requires a serious education of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.649" end="00:14:10.180" style="s2">Elkind and i think that if we thought of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.959" end="00:14:13.689" style="s2">the humanities as directed towards that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.180" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">we can see why they might be one way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.689" end="00:14:20.829" style="s2">fill the moral void that grows so easily</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:22.389" style="s2">in people&#39;s lives so young had this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.829" end="00:14:25.869" style="s2">which I really love it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.389" end="00:14:28.389" style="s2">sophisticated idea it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.869" end="00:14:31.480" style="s2">idea of how the self first of all so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.389" end="00:14:33.699" style="s2">self for young this Christ was a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.480" end="00:14:35.589" style="s2">of the self so the logos was a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.699" end="00:14:37.089" style="s2">the self so that&#39;s sort of what would</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.589" end="00:14:39.459" style="s2">you say it&#39;s the divine essence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.089" end="00:14:41.740" style="s2">humanity and the image of that is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.459" end="00:14:45.220" style="s2">symbol of the self and for young the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.740" end="00:14:48.009" style="s2">self was the totality of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">across time and space so it&#39;s whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.009" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">you are as as a transcendent object</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:54.579" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:57.009" style="s2">and then can imagine that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.579" end="00:14:59.889" style="s2">transcendent object also has to interact</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.009" end="00:15:03.100" style="s2">with you and the world moment by moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.889" end="00:15:05.769" style="s2">and his belief was that those times when</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.100" end="00:15:07.660" style="s2">that space of meaning opened up so there</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.769" end="00:15:10.120" style="s2">is that convergence between the fact and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.660" end="00:15:12.699" style="s2">and the gripping of the fact was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.120" end="00:15:15.459" style="s2">manifestation of the self which is this</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.699" end="00:15:18.129" style="s2">transcendent object in the specific</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.459" end="00:15:21.999" style="s2">moment of time and space and therefore a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.129" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">call forward to move towards revealing</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.999" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">that totality as much as it can be</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:28.839" style="s2">revealed and so it would be partly and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.819" style="s2">that would be partly revealed by then</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.839" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">following a meaningful pathway and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.819" end="00:15:35.220" style="s2">would be the case that if you&#39;re engaged</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.009" end="00:19:18.149" style="s2">about the idea of power as the</p>

<p begin="00:19:19.799" end="00:19:24.619" style="s2">think well you can think of the West as</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.529" end="00:19:46.590" style="s2">of massage therapists well because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.470" end="00:19:48.899" style="s2">it&#39;s dead relevant it&#39;s like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.590" end="00:19:50.700" style="s2">you need a plumber and you do need a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.899" end="00:19:52.739" style="s2">plumber everyone agrees that you need a</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.739" end="00:19:57.179" style="s2">otherwise and so and then the question</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.379" end="00:19:59.159" style="s2">is well how is it that you go about</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.179" end="00:20:01.830" style="s2">selecting a plumber and the answer isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.159" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">that there are roving bands of</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.869" end="00:20:20.700" style="s2">happens instead is that you look for the</p>

<p begin="00:22:28.999" end="00:22:34.070" style="s2">in the psychological and practical sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.570" end="00:22:36.499" style="s2">yeah but we do have to try and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.070" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">understand why it is that there is such</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.499" end="00:22:41.779" style="s2">a charm in the Foucauldian position why</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:44.299" style="s2">is it that people want to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.779" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">all the best things what we think of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.299" end="00:22:48.980" style="s2">best things in human relations are</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:51.590" style="s2">simply disguised forms of manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:53.550" style="s2">you know that that the whole feminist</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.590" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">view of the relations in men and women</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.550" end="00:22:59.580" style="s2">for instance which is founded on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:03.330" style="s2">deep myth that men are exercising</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.580" end="00:23:06.000" style="s2">exercise power as agender</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.330" end="00:23:10.620" style="s2">to use the fashionable world the word /</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.000" end="00:23:13.920" style="s2">/ women and that all study of this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.620" end="00:23:16.370" style="s2">just a way of revealing that power and</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.920" end="00:23:20.220" style="s2">and the capillaries through which it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.370" end="00:23:23.610" style="s2">flows you know I think there&#39;s a will to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.220" end="00:23:26.160" style="s2">believe this and why is one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.610" end="00:23:29.640" style="s2">questions that I think we have to try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.160" end="00:23:32.070" style="s2">understand is it that when people lose</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.640" end="00:23:34.560" style="s2">some kind of transcendental religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.070" end="00:23:38.430" style="s2">faith that they are automatically fall</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.560" end="00:23:42.510" style="s2">into this great pit of resentment as of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.430" end="00:23:45.240" style="s2">the Nietzschean kind to try and find the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.510" end="00:23:47.820" style="s2">the oppressor in every relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.240" end="00:23:50.610" style="s2">is there are there truths that they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.820" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">exploring as well is there are there</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.610" end="00:23:55.560" style="s2">forms of power or forms of human</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:57.780" style="s2">relation that look like power from one</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.560" end="00:24:00.210" style="s2">aspect but are perhaps also look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.780" end="00:24:02.190" style="s2">tenderness and dependence from another</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.210" end="00:24:04.440" style="s2">aspect and that they&#39;ve just are</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.190" end="00:24:06.090" style="s2">emphasizing one half of it or something</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.440" end="00:24:08.190" style="s2">like that I think there are they&#39;re real</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.090" end="00:24:11.160" style="s2">questions as to how it is that our</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.190" end="00:24:13.080" style="s2">culture has got into this position yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.160" end="00:24:15.510" style="s2">well that&#39;s the question below the claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.080" end="00:24:17.310" style="s2">of power and so I mean I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.510" end="00:24:20.790" style="s2">about that to some degree and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.310" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">three possibilities I mean one is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.790" end="00:24:25.500" style="s2">accusation that all there is is power is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">the justification for use of power of</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.500" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">course so that&#39;s that&#39;s handy if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:32.730" style="s2">what you want to use so then then</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:35.340" style="s2">there&#39;s another problem and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.730" end="00:24:37.320" style="s2">along with the the failure the willful</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:39.750" style="s2">failure to distinguish competence from</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.320" end="00:24:41.280" style="s2">tyranny and power let&#39;s say because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.750" end="00:24:43.380" style="s2">might think of power as unearned</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.280" end="00:24:45.810" style="s2">Authority something like that because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.380" end="00:24:48.180" style="s2">need a definition of power and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.810" end="00:24:50.550" style="s2">that there&#39;s a resentment at work there</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.180" end="00:24:52.560" style="s2">that&#39;s very very deep I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.550" end="00:24:57.060" style="s2">deep in the biblical sense which is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.560" end="00:24:59.730" style="s2">there is a proclivity for those who do</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.060" end="00:25:03.060" style="s2">not manifest what they could manifest in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.730" end="00:25:05.340" style="s2">the world and thereby fail to watch the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.060" end="00:25:06.390" style="s2">success of those who do manifest what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.340" end="00:25:08.280" style="s2">they could manifest</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.390" end="00:25:10.140" style="s2">the world and succeed and become</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.280" end="00:25:12.060" style="s2">embittered by that tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.140" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">embittered and then to label that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.060" end="00:25:16.620" style="s2">power and then to attempt to destroy it</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:19.620" style="s2">because it&#39;s simpler to do that than to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.620" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">do the radical internal retooling that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.620" end="00:25:24.030" style="s2">would be required to set things straight</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:26.220" style="s2">internally I&#39;m sure that&#39;s right that</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.030" end="00:25:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s one explanation of why people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.220" end="00:25:31.950" style="s2">always tempted by the zero-sum vision of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.800" end="00:25:34.500" style="s2">relations his benefit is my cost sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.950" end="00:25:37.620" style="s2">thing right yeah I wanted to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.500" end="00:25:41.610" style="s2">that that the the the very widespread</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.620" end="00:25:44.580" style="s2">view that things are zero-sum which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:46.230" style="s2">of course the language of power what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.580" end="00:25:49.380" style="s2">the antidote to that what is that how</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.230" end="00:25:52.650" style="s2">does one overturn the the ideology of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.380" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">power how does one transcend that with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.650" end="00:26:01.320" style="s2">nonzero-sum truth or approach to life I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:03.510" style="s2">personally would say that the first</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.320" end="00:26:06.600" style="s2">thing to recognize is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.510" end="00:26:08.850" style="s2">positive some games you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.600" end="00:26:11.340" style="s2">the the real theory of the market tells</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.850" end="00:26:14.420" style="s2">us that there are whole realms of human</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.340" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">transactions where both parties gain</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.420" end="00:26:23.190" style="s2">from from their shared engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">though that doesn&#39;t won&#39;t drive away the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.190" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2">real source of this this difficulty has</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:33.030" style="s2">subdued what Jordan was referring to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.340" style="s2">know that people&#39;s people&#39;s resentment</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.030" end="00:26:37.740" style="s2">at the success of others when they</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.340" end="00:26:39.960" style="s2">cannot match it or cannot easily match</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.740" end="00:26:42.470" style="s2">it will not know or will not mention</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.960" end="00:26:47.250" style="s2">which is evil works yes exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.470" end="00:26:49.560" style="s2">because of the labor of re re conceiving</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.250" end="00:26:51.300" style="s2">your own position in such that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.560" end="00:26:53.280" style="s2">actually have to do something about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.300" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">you know that it&#39;s there are some</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.280" end="00:26:59.250" style="s2">there&#39;s something lazy about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:27:01.230" style="s2">zero-sum vision yeah but it&#39;s not a you</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.250" end="00:27:05.730" style="s2">know it&#39;s not a vision that successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.230" end="00:27:07.980" style="s2">people have you know any level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:09.420" style="s2">reality and you can actually combat that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.980" end="00:27:12.120" style="s2">to some degree by make it high</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.420" end="00:27:14.610" style="s2">resolution again by by making examples</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.120" end="00:27:19.140" style="s2">just like because very few people</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.610" end="00:27:19.950" style="s2">actually believe once they observe that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.140" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.950" end="00:27:24.029" style="s2">Nation ships they&#39;ve had with other</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:26.250" style="s2">people have been zero-sum now you might</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.029" end="00:27:28.830" style="s2">get some very disadvantaged people and</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.250" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2">and these people do exist who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.830" end="00:27:32.940" style="s2">taken advantage by virtually everyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:35.519" style="s2">they&#39;ve ever encountered in their whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.940" end="00:27:37.049" style="s2">life like that does happen but most of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.519" end="00:27:38.519" style="s2">the time all you have to do is remind</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.049" end="00:27:41.309" style="s2">people it&#39;s like well think of someone</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.519" end="00:27:43.289" style="s2">that you loved even briefly think of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.309" end="00:27:46.230" style="s2">friend that you&#39;ve had it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.289" end="00:27:48.179" style="s2">you you successfully negotiated with</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.230" end="00:27:51.210" style="s2">that friend to do things together</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.179" end="00:27:53.940" style="s2">because otherwise it&#39;s not a friendship</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.210" end="00:27:55.740" style="s2">and it has to be successful negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.940" end="00:27:57.330" style="s2">which means your friend has to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.740" end="00:27:59.940" style="s2">with what you were doing and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.330" end="00:28:01.710" style="s2">be happy and so and then wasn&#39;t it the</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.940" end="00:28:03.299" style="s2">case that you were both happy or doing</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.710" end="00:28:05.669" style="s2">that then either of you would have been</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.299" end="00:28:07.980" style="s2">doing something else alone and and isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.669" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">that evidence in your own action and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.980" end="00:28:11.639" style="s2">your life for the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:14.429" style="s2">nonzero-sum games and they&#39;re dependent</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.639" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">on successful negotiation is we can both</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.429" end="00:28:18.179" style="s2">have more than we would otherwise have</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:20.789" style="s2">if we can come to a consensus about what</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.179" end="00:28:23.010" style="s2">we&#39;ll both pursue and it&#39;s very few</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.789" end="00:28:25.230" style="s2">people when you make it personal like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.010" end="00:28:26.760" style="s2">that and high resolution again it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.230" end="00:28:29.880" style="s2">few people who are willing to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.760" end="00:28:32.370" style="s2">their ideology of zero-sum of a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.880" end="00:28:34.380" style="s2">reality so far down that they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.370" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">actually use that to characterize their</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.380" end="00:28:38.600" style="s2">most intimate relationships now I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:41.639" style="s2">say that someone who does that by</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.600" end="00:28:43.769" style="s2">temperament is literally psychopathic</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.639" end="00:28:46.019" style="s2">because the psychopathic view of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.769" end="00:28:49.139" style="s2">world is absolutely that it&#39;s a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.019" end="00:28:51.269" style="s2">game yes I think that&#39;s right but of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.139" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">course we have a whole body of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.269" end="00:28:56.880" style="s2">literature about sexuality which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:28:59.429" style="s2">trying to establish that that that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.880" end="00:29:01.529" style="s2">sexuality is the exercise of power of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.429" end="00:29:03.539" style="s2">one person over another you get it</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.529" end="00:29:08.519" style="s2">already in Sartre was Being and</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for because his freedom</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.950" end="00:29:27.899" style="s2">is his and not to be obtained by you and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:30.419" style="s2">therefore you can only do this by sort</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.899" end="00:29:32.710" style="s2">of tearing at his flesh getting him to</p>

<p begin="00:29:39.309" end="00:29:45.480" style="s2">you get that image used by Simone de</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.480" end="00:29:50.919" style="s2">essentially to D legitimize the idea</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:57.309" style="s2">think it also masks a more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.659" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">problem that&#39;s really a biological</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.309" end="00:30:00.789" style="s2">problem like it&#39;s a misapprehension of a</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.789" end="00:30:06.309" style="s2">but part of what sex does is temporarily</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.850" end="00:30:08.890" style="s2">subordinate the individual to nature and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.309" end="00:30:12.340" style="s2">the species and so there is a domination</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.890" end="00:30:14.679" style="s2">there no and if if if a woman decides to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.340" end="00:30:16.149" style="s2">have a child then she is going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.679" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">undergo a series of extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.149" end="00:30:20.200" style="s2">radical transformations and she&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:22.539" style="s2">going to end up in a situation where in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.200" end="00:30:24.370" style="s2">all likelihood something else becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.539" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">fundamentally more important than her</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.370" end="00:30:28.840" style="s2">and there so there is a there&#39;s a sub it</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:31.539" style="s2">might be voluntary subjugation but</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.840" end="00:30:33.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a subjugation to nature and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.539" end="00:30:35.649" style="s2">that&#39;s built into the fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.100" end="00:30:37.630" style="s2">existence and I think it&#39;s very easy not</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.649" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">to want to grapple with that because</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.630" end="00:30:42.130" style="s2">it&#39;s such a profound problem and then to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">to make that as secondary consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.130" end="00:30:45.730" style="s2">something like unbalanced power</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:48.820" style="s2">relationships between the genders but of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.730" end="00:30:51.549" style="s2">course our traditional religion offers</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.820" end="00:30:54.250" style="s2">you selves for this that the rite of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.549" end="00:30:56.409" style="s2">passage in which which joins man to</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.250" end="00:30:58.510" style="s2">woman the rite of passage which makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.409" end="00:31:03.309" style="s2">birth an experience of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.510" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">community and death likewise and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.309" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">know the sense also that in these great</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:13.539" style="s2">events one is occupying a position in</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:16.539" style="s2">law in a moral space that has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.539" end="00:31:19.539" style="s2">occupied by generations before one and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.539" end="00:31:21.309" style="s2">so on this normalizing of these huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.539" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">transitions I think is something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.309" end="00:31:27.520" style="s2">that we&#39;ve always depended upon religion</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:30.549" style="s2">to provide is sacralized yes and having</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.520" end="00:31:33.549" style="s2">taken that away or or ignored it or try</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.549" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">to live without exactly without the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.549" end="00:31:39.220" style="s2">of a sacrament and we&#39;re actually at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:41.980" style="s2">loss when these great transitions occur</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.220" end="00:31:45.730" style="s2">as well because it is the case in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.980" end="00:31:46.280" style="s2">that to to engage in the integration of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.730" end="00:31:48.830" style="s2">sexual</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.280" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">with your individual life is a series of</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.830" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">sacrifices so for example if you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:55.550" style="s2">married that&#39;s a sacrifice because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:57.560" style="s2">a sacrifice of all other people and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.550" end="00:32:00.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a sacrifice of that possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.560" end="00:32:01.610" style="s2">then to have a child is the sacrifice of</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.260" end="00:32:04.610" style="s2">all the things that you could have done</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.610" end="00:32:08.600" style="s2">otherwise then having that child and -</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.610" end="00:32:10.460" style="s2">but - - as you pointed out to make that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.600" end="00:32:13.100" style="s2">part of a broader tradition to say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.460" end="00:32:15.020" style="s2">well that is a sacrifice and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.100" end="00:32:17.930" style="s2">loss that goes along with that but what</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.020" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">you gain as a consequences of if as of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.930" end="00:32:22.340" style="s2">immeasurable significance in contrast to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:23.930" style="s2">the loss and one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.340" end="00:32:25.670" style="s2">really struck me in this lecture tour</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.930" end="00:32:27.830" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been doing so I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.670" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">about a hundred cities and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.830" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve been talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.870" style="s2">about is its meaning and I suppose its</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:34.970" style="s2">meaning in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.870" end="00:32:37.490" style="s2">transcendent and and the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.970" end="00:32:39.680" style="s2">meaning as an antidote to suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:41.990" style="s2">to malevolence and the hypothesis is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.680" end="00:32:44.570" style="s2">something like well meaning is to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.990" end="00:32:46.610" style="s2">found in responsibility and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.570" end="00:32:48.410" style="s2">a it&#39;s a revelation to people because</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.610" end="00:32:49.040" style="s2">they haven&#39;t conceptualized it that way</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.410" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.040" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like meaning isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:56.930" style="s2">happiness isn&#39;t self-esteem and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:32:59.390" style="s2">momentary pleasure isn&#39;t any of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.930" end="00:33:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s the bearing of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.390" end="00:33:03.470" style="s2">sacrificial burden and that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.280" end="00:33:05.450" style="s2">actually works to enrich and ennoble</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.470" end="00:33:07.370" style="s2">your life in ways that make the tragic</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.450" end="00:33:09.470" style="s2">element of it tolerable and - and to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.370" end="00:33:11.740" style="s2">keep you from bitterness and so these</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.470" end="00:33:14.030" style="s2">things that are put forward as</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.740" end="00:33:16.520" style="s2">subjugation like the subjugation of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.030" end="00:33:18.710" style="s2">woman to the to the catastrophe of birth</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.520" end="00:33:21.470" style="s2">let&#39;s say or even the the indignity of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.710" end="00:33:22.910" style="s2">of patriarchal Union is all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.470" end="00:33:25.160" style="s2">something that you can take on as an</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.910" end="00:33:27.350" style="s2">aspirational goal rather than something</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.160" end="00:33:29.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a mere imposition on your on your</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.350" end="00:33:31.790" style="s2">moment to moment freedom as a relief to</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.630" end="00:33:34.580" style="s2">people to hear that and to know it of</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.790" end="00:33:38.420" style="s2">course now I agree with that but there</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.580" end="00:33:39.260" style="s2">is also the sense that in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.420" end="00:33:41.450" style="s2">which we live</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.260" end="00:33:44.780" style="s2">we&#39;re obviously people have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.450" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">detached to a great extent from the any</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.780" end="00:33:49.720" style="s2">continuous religious tradition there</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:52.370" style="s2">still is a sense of loss as a people</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.720" end="00:33:54.080" style="s2">they don&#39;t they know that they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.370" end="00:33:55.629" style="s2">missing something but don&#39;t know quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.080" end="00:33:57.789" style="s2">how to identify</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.629" end="00:33:59.590" style="s2">and that&#39;s one reason for thinking for</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.789" end="00:34:01.419" style="s2">them thinking that it it&#39;s been taken</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.590" end="00:34:03.159" style="s2">away something&#39;s been stolen from them</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.419" end="00:34:05.470" style="s2">and they look around at the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.159" end="00:34:08.740" style="s2">are at ease in the world and successful</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.470" end="00:34:11.020" style="s2">and seem to be you know on good terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.740" end="00:34:14.020" style="s2">with themselves and think of them as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.020" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">ones who&#39;ve done the stealing and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.020" end="00:34:18.010" style="s2">is a dangerous attitude and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">well it&#39;s surely that is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.010" end="00:34:24.339" style="s2">erupts in all these strange academic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:26.139" style="s2">disciplines like gender studies which</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.339" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">simply have as their goal the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.139" end="00:34:30.549" style="s2">undermining of the existing order</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:33.129" style="s2">without anything positive to put in its</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.549" end="00:34:35.379" style="s2">place and I don&#39;t know what that those</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.129" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">those academic studies recruit people</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.379" end="00:34:41.710" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:45.099" style="s2">from this fund of of isolation this from</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.710" end="00:34:47.139" style="s2">the sense a sense of loss without an</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.099" end="00:34:47.889" style="s2">ability to identify the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.139" end="00:34:49.869" style="s2">been lost</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.889" end="00:34:51.639" style="s2">that&#39;s the cult-like element of them</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.869" end="00:34:53.500" style="s2">because they do I would say to some</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.639" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">degree prey on people whose</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.500" end="00:34:57.609" style="s2">interpersonal relationships have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:00.579" style="s2">irreparably damaged right I have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.609" end="00:35:02.859" style="s2">hypothesis about about the feminist end</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.579" end="00:35:05.410" style="s2">of the postmodern radical leftist</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.859" end="00:35:07.780" style="s2">movement so and this is something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.410" end="00:35:09.819" style="s2">talked about much in public but but well</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.780" end="00:35:13.180" style="s2">but here goes this should give me in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.819" end="00:35:14.319" style="s2">lots of trouble so so and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.180" end="00:35:16.900" style="s2">variety of things that are tangled</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.319" end="00:35:19.559" style="s2">together here so we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.900" end="00:35:22.690" style="s2">female biology would manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.559" end="00:35:24.900" style="s2">politically male biology does female</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.690" end="00:35:27.700" style="s2">biology is going to and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.900" end="00:35:29.710" style="s2">female political activity on the largest</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.700" end="00:35:33.609" style="s2">possible scale is a relatively new</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.710" end="00:35:36.309" style="s2">phenomenon so so and it isn&#39;t obviously</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.609" end="00:35:37.240" style="s2">the case that men and women&#39;s views of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.309" end="00:35:39.700" style="s2">the world are going to dovetail</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.240" end="00:35:43.270" style="s2">precisely so here&#39;s a hypothesis you</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.700" end="00:35:45.730" style="s2">tell me what you think about this so one</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.270" end="00:35:49.750" style="s2">thing that a woman really wants to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.730" end="00:35:51.819" style="s2">about a man or perhaps you might say one</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.750" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">thing that feminine and he wants to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.819" end="00:35:58.329" style="s2">about masculinity is that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:36:01.390" style="s2">predatory tyrant okay so and here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.329" end="00:36:03.640" style="s2">I mean first of all there&#39;s fragility</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.390" end="00:36:05.559" style="s2">and feminine sexuality to a greater</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.640" end="00:36:09.100" style="s2">degree than there is in male sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.559" end="00:36:11.590" style="s2">because women bear a higher price for</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.100" end="00:36:14.110" style="s2">sexual misadventure let&#39;s say and are</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.590" end="00:36:18.100" style="s2">perhaps more prone to exploitation by</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.110" end="00:36:20.170" style="s2">force but more than that part of being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.100" end="00:36:21.370" style="s2">woman is having the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.170" end="00:36:24.610" style="s2">bringing something extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.370" end="00:36:27.360" style="s2">fragile and vulnerable and valuable into</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.610" end="00:36:32.020" style="s2">the world and the first concern might be</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.360" end="00:36:34.300" style="s2">are you a predator fundamentally are you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.020" end="00:36:36.370" style="s2">a predator and so what I see happening</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.300" end="00:36:38.200" style="s2">in the in the feminist disciplines like</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.370" end="00:36:40.840" style="s2">gender studies is the politicization of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.200" end="00:36:43.900" style="s2">that accusation and the accusation is</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.840" end="00:36:46.660" style="s2">prove to me that you&#39;re not a predator</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.900" end="00:36:48.790" style="s2">like in your fund in the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.660" end="00:36:51.340" style="s2">element of your masculinity not only</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.790" end="00:36:54.370" style="s2">historically but now because the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.340" end="00:36:57.100" style="s2">you being a predators is too high now I</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.370" end="00:36:58.570" style="s2">feel that that&#39;s an inappropriate I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.100" end="00:37:00.340" style="s2">think that&#39;s what&#39;s driving the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.570" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">demolition of the idea of presumption of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.340" end="00:37:04.990" style="s2">innocence for example we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">presumption of guilt and prove to you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.990" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">be proved to me that you&#39;re innocent and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">I think the problem with that isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.740" style="s2">there are no predatory men because there</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:17.500" style="s2">are plenty of predatory men the problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.740" end="00:37:20.350" style="s2">is is that the courageous way to deal</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.500" end="00:37:23.050" style="s2">with the problem of the predator is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.350" end="00:37:25.060" style="s2">offer a hand in courageous trust and to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.050" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">invite forward a partner from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.060" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">monster that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:31.510" style="s2">mythological manner in which this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:34.330" style="s2">supposed to be undertaken the courageous</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.510" end="00:37:36.700" style="s2">a parker aegis part of the woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.330" end="00:37:39.670" style="s2">journey let&#39;s say is to face the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.700" end="00:37:42.070" style="s2">monstrosity of a man and to invite out</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.670" end="00:37:44.170" style="s2">of that something more noble to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.070" end="00:37:47.140" style="s2">and there&#39;s courage in that in genuine</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.170" end="00:37:50.170" style="s2">risk and I think that that&#39;s foregone in</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.140" end="00:37:52.390" style="s2">the accusation process and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.170" end="00:37:55.060" style="s2">other element of that seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.390" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">that well if you are a predator and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.060" end="00:38:00.270" style="s2">you&#39;re irredeemable in your predatory</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:03.250" style="s2">nature then the best thing to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.270" end="00:38:05.260" style="s2">render you harmless and if we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.250" end="00:38:07.630" style="s2">to obscure the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.260" end="00:38:09.400" style="s2">competence and power and assume that all</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.630" end="00:38:11.140" style="s2">of your striving upward is merely a</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.400" end="00:38:12.730" style="s2">manifestation of power then what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.140" end="00:38:15.370" style="s2">do is we can you as much as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.730" end="00:38:17.620" style="s2">that harmlessness can replace virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.370" end="00:38:20.230" style="s2">I see all of that driving these</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.620" end="00:38:21.940" style="s2">resentful disciplines in there and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.230" end="00:38:24.310" style="s2">reason am is the amass key</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.940" end="00:38:26.470" style="s2">with the man yeah that&#39;s the evil queen</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.310" end="00:38:28.390" style="s2">yeah yeah because we have the evil king</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.470" end="00:38:30.510" style="s2">right that&#39;s the tyrannical patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.390" end="00:38:36.220" style="s2">well the evil queen is lurking somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.510" end="00:38:39.849" style="s2">yes so the problem is I know it a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.220" end="00:38:42.640" style="s2">this is true but our society does not</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.849" end="00:38:45.579" style="s2">seem to have the capacity to put that to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.640" end="00:38:47.410" style="s2">one side and celebrates the normal the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.579" end="00:38:50.020" style="s2">the the fact that most men and most</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.410" end="00:38:54.280" style="s2">women are not like that and that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.020" end="00:38:56.140" style="s2">is there is a natural desire and need of</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.280" end="00:38:58.540" style="s2">the sexes to love each other to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.140" end="00:39:02.020" style="s2">united and to create children and so on</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.540" end="00:39:05.589" style="s2">and that that the old stability that</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.020" end="00:39:08.770" style="s2">that was built upon this has gone so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.589" end="00:39:10.780" style="s2">mean that and nobody wants nobody in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.770" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">intellectual world wants to celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.780" end="00:39:17.140" style="s2">there so so I just I had this interview</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:21.250" style="s2">a few a month ago or so with a woman</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.140" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">from GQ and she was fully on board the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:26.829" style="s2">the predatory mail train let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">you know when people like that interview</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.829" end="00:39:29.589" style="s2">me they start talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.020" style="s2">patriarchy and I say well I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.589" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">believe in the patriarchy I don&#39;t buy</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:35.260" style="s2">that conceptual structure what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:37.540" style="s2">interesting and this has happened more</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.260" end="00:39:40.420" style="s2">and more over the years as they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.540" end="00:39:42.940" style="s2">developed us first of all the person</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.420" end="00:39:45.369" style="s2">that I would be talking to had some idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.940" end="00:39:47.500" style="s2">that it was hypothetically possible to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.369" end="00:39:49.540" style="s2">reject the idea of the patriarchy but</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.500" end="00:39:52.390" style="s2">now when I say I don&#39;t believe in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.540" end="00:39:54.310" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that ideas meant with stunned</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.390" end="00:39:54.640" style="s2">disbelief it&#39;s like what what do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.310" end="00:39:56.290" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.640" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t believe in the tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.290" end="00:40:02.050" style="s2">Patriot everyone knows that&#39;s true and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:04.359" style="s2">think well so here&#39;s your hypothesis so</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.050" end="00:40:06.790" style="s2">this is the hypothesis that throw</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.359" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">history the fundamental relationship</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.790" end="00:40:11.650" style="s2">between man and woman is one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:13.660" style="s2">parasitism and exploitation that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.650" end="00:40:16.359" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s the case I guess until</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.660" end="00:40:18.040" style="s2">1960 and the publication of The Feminine</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.359" end="00:40:19.450" style="s2">Mystique or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.040" end="00:40:21.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the entire course of human</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.450" end="00:40:23.230" style="s2">history and then when the when it seems</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.460" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">to me that the appropriate story is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.230" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">men and women labored mightily under</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:31.660" style="s2">their terrible constraints for for</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:35.320" style="s2">uncounted centuries cooperating together</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.660" end="00:40:37.420" style="s2">by and large to to build some body</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.320" end="00:40:38.710" style="s2">of security and and freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.420" end="00:40:41.020" style="s2">stability so that they could raise</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.710" end="00:40:43.150" style="s2">children and have a somewhat harmonious</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.020" end="00:40:45.610" style="s2">and productive life and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.150" end="00:40:48.390" style="s2">it&#39;s become not only questionable to put</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.610" end="00:40:51.610" style="s2">forth that as a proposition but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.390" end="00:40:53.770" style="s2">tyrannical in it in in essence just for</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.610" end="00:40:55.710" style="s2">positing it as a reality but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.770" end="00:40:59.890" style="s2">partly because isn&#39;t it because of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.710" end="00:41:02.140" style="s2">peculiar view that the underlying all</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.890" end="00:41:03.940" style="s2">this there&#39;s a kind of social structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.140" end="00:41:05.320" style="s2">that would this is being created the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.940" end="00:41:08.320" style="s2">distinction between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.320" end="00:41:10.810" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have its basis in nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.320" end="00:41:13.060" style="s2">its basis is in the institutions that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.810" end="00:41:15.730" style="s2">have created and since we created them</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:18.730" style="s2">we can change them that there is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.730" end="00:41:21.220" style="s2">been it&#39;s sort of a kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.730" end="00:41:24.340" style="s2">hysterical invasion of everything by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.220" end="00:41:26.980" style="s2">idea of human choice if there is if</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.340" end="00:41:28.630" style="s2">there is a structure to the relation</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.980" end="00:41:31.570" style="s2">between men and women then we ought to</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.630" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">be able to change it and of course chain</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.570" end="00:41:35.890" style="s2">we might mean that I have to change my</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:38.350" style="s2">sex in order to to conform to the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.890" end="00:41:44.220" style="s2">things are but that also has become a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.350" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">choice well and is is is not a very very</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.220" end="00:41:48.580" style="s2">constant focus on division whether</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:51.130" style="s2">between man and woman or between left</p>

<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">sign of a loss of a common human culture</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:18.810" style="s2">all are as human beings and and so if if</p>

<p begin="00:42:21.430" end="00:42:28.930" style="s2">urgent in our time and and I wonder it</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.320" end="00:42:30.670" style="s2">might be difficult to find anyone who at</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.930" end="00:42:32.500" style="s2">least when you go down to a high enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.670" end="00:42:34.960" style="s2">level of resolution as you say Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.500" end="00:42:41.370" style="s2">would not think this is true that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.960" end="00:42:41.370" style="s2">must recover that sense of ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:47.410" style="s2">entities that participate in a universal</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.850" end="00:42:48.730" style="s2">and transcendent plane that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.410" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">common cult</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.730" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">that I see myself in the other as you</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:56.730" style="s2">were saying earlier Roger and I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">to have both of your thoughts on what</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.730" end="00:43:03.670" style="s2">strategies were means for that recovery</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:08.080" style="s2">and perhaps we can focus particularly on</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.670" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">the the the the questions that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.080" end="00:43:13.420" style="s2">started with with art music you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:17.560" style="s2">written too extensively an architecture</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.420" end="00:43:19.360" style="s2">of course Roger and you&#39;ve thought long</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.560" end="00:43:21.430" style="s2">and hard about the humanities Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.360" end="00:43:25.590" style="s2">what is it what is the character of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.430" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">recovery how do we bring that about well</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.590" end="00:43:31.800" style="s2">if I may begin I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">well first of all you have to identify</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.800" end="00:43:38.260" style="s2">those aspects of the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:40.840" style="s2">that move of their own accord towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.260" end="00:43:43.690" style="s2">reconciliation you know a rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.840" end="00:43:46.660" style="s2">conflict and and division of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.690" end="00:43:49.080" style="s2">that you&#39;re referring to and we are very</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.660" end="00:43:51.300" style="s2">familiar with them it&#39;s not just that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.080" end="00:43:54.280" style="s2">just love which of course is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.300" end="00:43:55.990" style="s2">very complex in and can&#39;t be can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.280" end="00:43:58.210" style="s2">just conjured from the skies but there</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.990" end="00:44:02.700" style="s2">are there are other aspects of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.210" end="00:44:04.660" style="s2">condition that we can educate through</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.700" end="00:44:06.940" style="s2">first first of all through studying</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.660" end="00:44:10.210" style="s2">examples and then through imitation and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.940" end="00:44:13.180" style="s2">then through self-discipline obviously</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.210" end="00:44:16.510" style="s2">forgiveness is one of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.180" end="00:44:19.120" style="s2">the habit of putting yourself in another</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.510" end="00:44:22.930" style="s2">person&#39;s perspective looking at yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.120" end="00:44:26.770" style="s2">from outside and wondering whether you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.930" end="00:44:29.350" style="s2">know the you are as so seen acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.770" end="00:44:32.020" style="s2">to yourself all those you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.350" end="00:44:36.130" style="s2">again religion of the Christian religion</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.020" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">at least was built upon that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.130" end="00:44:41.550" style="s2">intellectual discipline the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:44.080" style="s2">of seeing your neighbor as yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.550" end="00:44:50.500" style="s2">seeing yourself therefore as a mere</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.080" end="00:44:55.050" style="s2">neighbor and I I suspect that you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.500" end="00:44:58.870" style="s2">we have to revive those basic moral</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.050" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">disciplines not for the use of people</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.870" end="00:45:04.790" style="s2">who don&#39;t have the overarching faith</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:07.580" style="s2">their belief in transcendental judgment</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.790" end="00:45:10.310" style="s2">into which we will be all calls but whom</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.580" end="00:45:12.620" style="s2">nevertheless have to be shown that we do</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.310" end="00:45:15.820" style="s2">live our lives as an object of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.620" end="00:45:18.680" style="s2">nevertheless and here are some guides</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.820" end="00:45:21.950" style="s2">you know just read Anna Karenina for</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.680" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">example I know it takes a long time for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.950" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">facebook addicted youth to read Anna</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:30.940" style="s2">Karenina but they still hope you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:35.330" style="s2">and and they&#39;re likely to listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.940" end="00:45:40.070" style="s2">so so well because maybe more people can</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.330" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">listen then can read I mean so so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.070" end="00:45:46.580" style="s2">let&#39;s think about literature for a bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:49.540" style="s2">and so now if you read something like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.580" end="00:45:52.850" style="s2">Dostoyevsky novel or Anna Karenina</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.540" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">you&#39;re not really reading the account of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.850" end="00:45:57.950" style="s2">a single person&#39;s life what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.100" end="00:46:01.850" style="s2">reading is it&#39;s like the author has</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.950" end="00:46:03.830" style="s2">taken a variety of lives and amalgamated</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.850" end="00:46:06.200" style="s2">them and unified them into something</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.830" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s like a it&#39;s like a compilation of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:11.030" style="s2">lives so it&#39;s life it&#39;s like life writ</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:14.540" style="s2">large so that&#39;s what fiction is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.030" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">more true than than reality because just</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.540" end="00:46:17.600" style="s2">like a mathematical abstraction can be</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.340" end="00:46:20.750" style="s2">more real than the thing that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.600" end="00:46:23.330" style="s2">represents in some sense the fiction is</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.750" end="00:46:25.430" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a portrait if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.330" end="00:46:26.780" style="s2">sit for a portrait you&#39;ll sit and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.430" end="00:46:28.250" style="s2">artist will paint you and then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.780" end="00:46:29.840" style="s2">sit again and then you&#39;ll sit again and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.250" end="00:46:32.060" style="s2">then you&#39;ll sit again and so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.840" end="00:46:34.070" style="s2">portrait is actually a composite of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.060" end="00:46:35.630" style="s2">and so it&#39;s got a richness sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.070" end="00:46:37.220" style="s2">that a photograph can&#39;t match and a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.630" end="00:46:40.280" style="s2">fictional character is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.220" end="00:46:42.410" style="s2">composite of many people and so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.280" end="00:46:44.630" style="s2">opportunity to read a great work of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.410" end="00:46:47.600" style="s2">fiction is the opportunity to place</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.630" end="00:46:49.730" style="s2">yourself in the perspective not of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.600" end="00:46:51.590" style="s2">merely another person like you do in</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.730" end="00:46:54.410" style="s2">normal discourse in the mundane setting</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.590" end="00:46:57.250" style="s2">but to place yourself in the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.410" end="00:46:58.700" style="s2">of a compiled character so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.250" end="00:47:01.040" style="s2">experienced that extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.700" end="00:47:02.870" style="s2">powerfully with Dostoyevsky&#39;s crime and</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.040" end="00:47:06.200" style="s2">punishment to put myself in the position</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.870" end="00:47:08.630" style="s2">of this student who was nihilistic and</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.200" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">who had every reason to commit murder</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.630" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s an unbelievably intense novel</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:15.350" style="s2">because everybody in the novel is hyper</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.410" style="s2">real and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.350" end="00:47:21.770" style="s2">we think of fiction as falsity or or or</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.410" end="00:47:24.170" style="s2">or as untruth and it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.770" end="00:47:26.870" style="s2">it&#39;s abstraction an abstraction isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.170" end="00:47:30.170" style="s2">untruth it&#39;s it&#39;s more than truth often</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.870" end="00:47:32.870" style="s2">and so the humanities can help us walk</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.170" end="00:47:34.580" style="s2">through the souls of others and because</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.870" end="00:47:37.610" style="s2">we can imitate and it&#39;s one of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.580" end="00:47:40.910" style="s2">primary remarkable miraculous abilities</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.610" end="00:47:42.530" style="s2">we can imitate the the compiled</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.910" end="00:47:44.150" style="s2">characters that we encounter in</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.530" end="00:47:46.610" style="s2">literature and mythology and religion</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.150" end="00:47:51.350" style="s2">and that does help flesh us out and</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.610" end="00:47:53.240" style="s2">ennoble us and we can we can I just</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.350" end="00:47:56.870" style="s2">wrote the foreword to Solzhenitsyn&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.240" end="00:47:58.220" style="s2">fiftieth anniversary version of The</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.220" end="00:48:05.300" style="s2">and I ran across his fervent wish that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.950" end="00:48:07.250" style="s2">people could learn from what he</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.300" end="00:48:09.350" style="s2">communicated all the horror and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.250" end="00:48:11.420" style="s2">suffering to put themselves in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.390" end="00:48:20.270" style="s2">decide that that&#39;s not the road to walk</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.120" end="00:48:21.950" style="s2">down and so the advantage of placing</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.270" end="00:48:23.330" style="s2">yourself in the position of other people</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.950" end="00:48:24.890" style="s2">is that if they&#39;re good people then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.330" end="00:48:26.360" style="s2">can be like them and if they&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.890" end="00:48:28.280" style="s2">people then you can avoid that pathway</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.360" end="00:48:30.890" style="s2">and then you don&#39;t have to learn that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.280" end="00:48:33.170" style="s2">through through the agony of direct</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.890" end="00:48:35.630" style="s2">personal experience in the short span of</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.870" end="00:48:48.950" style="s2">from the catastrophes of the past mmm no</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:53.090" style="s2">I agree with that oh but of course in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.950" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">fiction one&#39;s also concerned to identify</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.090" end="00:48:58.370" style="s2">if you&#39;re writing fiction identify with</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">a character in order to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.370" end="00:49:06.470" style="s2">character because it&#39;s not as though you</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">can you can&#39;t actually grasp a character</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.470" end="00:49:12.110" style="s2">from the outside you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:14.150" style="s2">see through his eyes what it what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.110" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">world is in which he is and that is I</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.150" end="00:49:20.630" style="s2">think an exercise of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:22.430" style="s2">which I value greatly and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.630" end="00:49:24.410" style="s2">necessarily come to the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.430" end="00:49:27.890" style="s2">therefore I don&#39;t want to be like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.410" end="00:49:31.430" style="s2">it might be just enough to say now I see</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.890" end="00:49:33.559" style="s2">that that&#39;s a possible human being and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.430" end="00:49:37.700" style="s2">your knowledge of the possibilities is</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.559" end="00:49:40.369" style="s2">amplified and your sense your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.700" end="00:49:42.829" style="s2">position yourself in those possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.369" end="00:49:45.019" style="s2">also I think right so that&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.829" end="00:49:47.329" style="s2">differentiation as well as direction yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.019" end="00:49:50.329" style="s2">no no I think sometimes in my more dire</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.329" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">moments that this opposition to cultural</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.329" end="00:49:55.250" style="s2">appropriation right so the idea that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:57.470" style="s2">not allowed anymore to imagine myself</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.250" end="00:49:59.329" style="s2">safe fictionally as a woman or us or as</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.470" end="00:50:02.180" style="s2">a character from another ethnicity or</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.329" end="00:50:05.750" style="s2">even to play the role that role as an</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.180" end="00:50:08.269" style="s2">actor I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.750" end="00:50:11.480" style="s2">assault on the idea of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.269" end="00:50:13.970" style="s2">and the nonzero-sum game because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.480" end="00:50:16.039" style="s2">precludes the possibility that I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.970" end="00:50:17.720" style="s2">take on the role of another in an</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.039" end="00:50:19.640" style="s2">understanding manner and actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.720" end="00:50:21.710" style="s2">facilitate a dialogue and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.640" end="00:50:23.510" style="s2">undermines the claim I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.710" end="00:50:25.430" style="s2">everything is only a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.510" end="00:50:27.980" style="s2">consequence of power because if I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.430" end="00:50:30.200" style="s2">actually bridge that gap well then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.980" end="00:50:31.970" style="s2">not isolated in my group or my ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.200" end="00:50:34.069" style="s2">or whatever it is I can I can become</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.970" end="00:50:36.019" style="s2">partly you and we can communicate and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.069" end="00:50:38.210" style="s2">would say because of that literature and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.019" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">art is a great threat to ideology</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.210" end="00:50:41.509" style="s2">especially of the group identity kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:43.519" style="s2">and of course they&#39;re perfectly aware of</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.509" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">that which is why the radicals on that</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.519" end="00:50:48.259" style="s2">side of the equation are doing</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.730" end="00:52:19.070" style="s2">well yeah yeah i but i&#39;ve understood the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.940" end="00:52:21.800" style="s2">world from the inside in another way but</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.070" end="00:52:24.440" style="s2">in I just wrote a book of stories which</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.800" end="00:52:26.900" style="s2">was just reviewed by somebody who says</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.440" end="00:52:30.380" style="s2">you know this these stories make</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.900" end="00:52:33.200" style="s2">cultural appropriation into a virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.380" end="00:52:35.869" style="s2">so I felt good about that they they</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:40.220" style="s2">begin with a an inside view of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.869" end="00:52:42.950" style="s2">psyche of a terrorist of an Arab</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.220" end="00:52:50.359" style="s2">terrorists who&#39;s who has a legacy of</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.950" end="00:52:53.690" style="s2">vengeance and who is a failure and whose</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.359" end="00:52:55.970" style="s2">loss I try to make real in in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.690" end="00:52:59.869" style="s2">feelings of the reader as he reads it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.970" end="00:53:01.910" style="s2">and and then the subsequent stories show</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.869" end="00:53:04.820" style="s2">the same kind of loss in completely</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.910" end="00:53:08.330" style="s2">different people I wanted to bring up</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.820" end="00:53:12.170" style="s2">that book of stories actually souls in</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.330" end="00:53:14.750" style="s2">Twilight by Sir Roger Scruton it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.170" end="00:53:16.280" style="s2">series of five short stories of five I</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.750" end="00:53:18.410" style="s2">think is that five short stories each</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.280" end="00:53:20.600" style="s2">which are portraits of a character at a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.410" end="00:53:22.700" style="s2">certain moment in time I think it&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.600" end="00:53:25.090" style="s2">to say Roger that they&#39;re all tragic</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.700" end="00:53:28.369" style="s2">stories in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.090" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">what I found so moving about those</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.369" end="00:53:34.990" style="s2">stories is that these are individuals in</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:39.160" style="s2">states of dislocation anchor &#39;less</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.990" end="00:53:42.950" style="s2">seeking depth meaning truth stability</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.160" end="00:53:45.350" style="s2">and yet in their confusion in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.950" end="00:53:47.150" style="s2">darkness willing against that very thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.350" end="00:53:50.060" style="s2">that they seek or you might say</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.150" end="00:53:53.930" style="s2">violating or transgressing that sacred</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.060" end="00:53:55.150" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re longing for that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.930" end="00:53:58.540" style="s2">not what&#39;s beautiful about</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.150" end="00:54:02.320" style="s2">book what&#39;s beautiful is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.540" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">reading the reader her or himself comes</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.320" end="00:54:11.620" style="s2">to a sense of what that longing is for</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:16.600" style="s2">positively a sense of the the stability</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.620" end="00:54:20.260" style="s2">of love or of home or of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.600" end="00:54:22.510" style="s2">and and and I suppose what I want to ask</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.260" end="00:54:24.490" style="s2">following up on this is that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.510" end="00:54:27.130" style="s2">to me a profoundly redemptive vision</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.490" end="00:54:29.890" style="s2">that you have in that in those beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.130" end="00:54:33.010" style="s2">stories Roger and that that it&#39;s showing</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.890" end="00:54:36.130" style="s2">the persistence of the beautiful and of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.010" end="00:54:37.780" style="s2">the good even in its absence that I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.130" end="00:54:40.270" style="s2">read that story and have a perception of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.780" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">what positively I am I am looking for</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.270" end="00:54:43.690" style="s2">and just to refer to it something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:46.510" style="s2">you say in in one of your books toward</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.690" end="00:54:50.830" style="s2">and that that even through an experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.510" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">of evil one can develop an apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.830" end="00:54:56.500" style="s2">of what the good is and wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">could each say something about the that</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:01.000" style="s2">you know either</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:02.350" style="s2">either there is a reality to these</p>

<p begin="00:55:04.750" end="00:55:09.630" style="s2">or beauty and truth or they have a</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.630" end="00:55:16.900" style="s2">persistent reality and I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.610" end="00:55:20.140" style="s2">you can each say something about the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:22.950" style="s2">persistence or sovereignty of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.140" end="00:55:28.230" style="s2">things even amidst our darkness and</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.950" end="00:55:31.440" style="s2">suffering well I I would say that in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.230" end="00:55:35.590" style="s2">tragedy when tragedy is really effective</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:38.790" style="s2">there is a Redemption offered in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.590" end="00:55:43.210" style="s2">through suffering that the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.790" end="00:55:46.060" style="s2">we we encounter the possibility in</p>

<p begin="00:55:51.790" end="00:55:57.940" style="s2">on a pot down upon himself destruction</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.310" end="00:55:59.740" style="s2">and destruction is no different from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.940" end="00:56:01.780" style="s2">destruction it&#39;s going to afflict all of</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.740" end="00:56:04.810" style="s2">us in the end anyway but here is</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.780" end="00:56:07.060" style="s2">somebody who who has faced it down in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.810" end="00:56:08.260" style="s2">some way that his nobility his nobility</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.060" end="00:56:10.750" style="s2">of nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.260" end="00:56:13.180" style="s2">and his ability to go out towards others</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.750" end="00:56:15.490" style="s2">in a condition of love and Rickon</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.180" end="00:56:19.930" style="s2">reconciliation has not been taken away</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.490" end="00:56:21.850" style="s2">from him and the spectacle of that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.930" end="00:56:25.210" style="s2">all the more intense because</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.850" end="00:56:27.910" style="s2">nevertheless the you know death</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.210" end="00:56:30.520" style="s2">intervenes and takes him away as it will</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.910" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">take you and me away but without having</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.520" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">had the chance to reveal a nobility or</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:39.100" style="s2">even to acquire it you know I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:43.360" style="s2">for that reason it&#39;s very important that</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.100" end="00:56:46.210" style="s2">in literature the noble characters are</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.360" end="00:56:49.350" style="s2">seen in a condition of loss sometimes</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.350" end="00:56:57.070" style="s2">comes because even though they&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.070" end="00:56:59.110" style="s2">what we all must in the end lose there</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.070" end="00:57:00.910" style="s2">is that in them which is struggling</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.110" end="00:57:03.820" style="s2">towards reconciliation with their own</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.910" end="00:57:07.420" style="s2">condition and with others it&#39;s the sense</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.300" end="00:57:31.300" style="s2">what the book is about the book is about</p>

<p begin="00:58:04.510" end="00:58:10.150" style="s2">movement and so you do see the light</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.900" end="00:58:12.190" style="s2">most clearly when it&#39;s superimposed</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.150" end="00:58:15.310" style="s2">against the darkest possible background</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.190" end="00:58:17.560" style="s2">and so and great literature which pulls</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.310" end="00:58:19.420" style="s2">people way down into the depths and in</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.560" end="00:58:20.890" style="s2">in this in this in this compiled</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.430" end="00:58:34.410" style="s2">opposite of that so I tell it by reading</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.780" end="00:58:36.970" style="s2">of your your your your work both of you</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.410" end="00:58:39.160" style="s2">there&#39;s an implicitly theological</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.970" end="00:58:40.600" style="s2">character here and we can&#39;t speak about</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.160" end="00:58:44.260" style="s2">the transcendent in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.600" end="00:58:46.390" style="s2">without being theological and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.260" end="00:58:48.460" style="s2">why is it that we can&#39;t just the lights</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.390" end="00:58:53.320" style="s2">just can&#39;t be completely shut out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.460" end="00:58:56.500" style="s2">if if if evil and darkness were the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.320" end="00:58:58.480" style="s2">sovereign principles as we say</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.500" end="00:59:00.250" style="s2">metaphysically well they could it could</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.480" end="00:59:02.530" style="s2">just be all the lights could just be</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.250" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">completely blackened and yet that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.530" end="00:59:09.460" style="s2">what we see and I&#39;m wondering if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:12.580" style="s2">would each comment on the what you take</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.460" end="00:59:15.390" style="s2">to be the I think what wouldn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.580" end="00:59:18.280" style="s2">might be a theological articulation of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.390" end="00:59:19.630" style="s2">the facts on the ground if the facts are</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.280" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">that you can&#39;t shut the lights right out</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.630" end="00:59:25.600" style="s2">that they&#39;re still there what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">going on there I totally agree with what</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.600" end="00:59:34.840" style="s2">Jordan said about the Gulag Archipelago</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.740" end="00:59:35.920" style="s2">and that goes back to just ask is from</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.840" end="00:59:38.020" style="s2">the House of the Dead</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.920" end="00:59:40.810" style="s2">you know his account of being in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.020" end="00:59:42.700" style="s2">Tsarist much milder with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.810" end="00:59:44.950" style="s2">imprisonment but nevertheless it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.700" end="00:59:47.140" style="s2">full of almost a vacation compared to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.950" end="00:59:49.630" style="s2">comparison I agree but nevertheless he</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.140" end="00:59:52.660" style="s2">described these characters who for whom</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.630" end="00:59:56.830" style="s2">that everything had been taken away but</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.660" end="01:00:00.130" style="s2">he also notes that in each of them you I</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.830" end="01:00:03.430" style="s2">can find the spark of God something</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.130" end="01:00:05.770" style="s2">which Janacek repeated when he made this</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.430" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">into the into that wonderful libretto</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.770" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">for his opera and anyon I try to show in</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">music how these derelict characters will</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:19.300" style="s2">suddenly shine with that with that light</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:22.030" style="s2">from another source but it doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.300" end="01:00:23.740" style="s2">just from what they are in that those</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.030" end="01:00:27.880" style="s2">circumstances but from something higher</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.740" end="01:00:30.610" style="s2">and I think you know I would say one is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.880" end="01:00:33.840" style="s2">always obliged to use metaphors when we</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.610" end="01:00:37.350" style="s2">get to this point but it is true that</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.840" end="01:00:39.590" style="s2">to that you can find in someone even in</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.350" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">the most deprived and desolate</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.590" end="01:00:46.620" style="s2">circumstances that on which you can blow</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:49.980" style="s2">to cause the spark once again to delight</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.620" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">up inside him and that is as far as we</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.980" end="01:00:56.310" style="s2">get to meeting God but there is no</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:59.940" style="s2">reason to think that we need to get any</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.310" end="01:01:02.970" style="s2">further in my view that&#39;s what people</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.940" end="01:01:07.020" style="s2">everybody saw in Maximilian Kolbe when</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.970" end="01:01:10.860" style="s2">he offered himself in the in Auschwitz</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.020" end="01:01:15.030" style="s2">for you know to as a sacrifice and while</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.860" end="01:01:16.920" style="s2">he was canonized you know suddenly you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.030" end="01:01:21.240" style="s2">see that there is something else in all</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.920" end="01:01:24.510" style="s2">of us in which in in circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.240" end="01:01:26.900" style="s2">however severe and deprived will will</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.510" end="01:01:29.910" style="s2">shine from it with a different light and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.900" end="01:01:31.980" style="s2">make those circumstances worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.910" end="01:01:34.170" style="s2">because they produced that light it</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.980" end="01:01:36.510" style="s2">could be in some sense the mercy of God</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.170" end="01:01:39.720" style="s2">that keeps him hidden from us because if</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.510" end="01:01:42.510" style="s2">you imagine that your sacred duty is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.720" end="01:01:45.420" style="s2">blow on those embers that you described</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.510" end="01:01:48.690" style="s2">even among people who are in desolate</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.420" end="01:01:50.970" style="s2">straits then every time you fail to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.690" end="01:01:53.130" style="s2">that opportunity then you tilt things</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.970" end="01:01:55.470" style="s2">badly towards what they shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.130" end="01:01:57.810" style="s2">tilted towards and it could be that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.470" end="01:02:00.600" style="s2">revelation of your inadequacy in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.810" end="01:02:02.910" style="s2">face of that moral duty which would be</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.600" end="01:02:04.980" style="s2">in some sense equivalent to an encounter</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.910" end="01:02:05.730" style="s2">with God would be enough to tear you</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.980" end="01:02:07.800" style="s2">into pieces</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.730" end="01:02:09.930" style="s2">and so maybe you get glimpses of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.800" end="01:02:12.360" style="s2">now and then because that&#39;s that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.930" end="01:02:14.370" style="s2">you and your current depraved moral</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.360" end="01:02:16.920" style="s2">state could stand of seeing of the face</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.370" end="01:02:20.340" style="s2">of God I think there&#39;s something to that</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.920" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what Seimone very says things to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.340" end="01:02:27.150" style="s2">that effect I think yeah and yes I often</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:28.770" style="s2">heard in the old communist days when I</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.150" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">used to travel around Eastern Europe and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.770" end="01:02:33.690" style="s2">and meet people who are in really dire</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:36.650" style="s2">straits they said similar things you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.690" end="01:02:36.650" style="s2">know that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.770" end="01:02:42.320" style="s2">that God would reveal himself but in</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.280" end="01:02:44.570" style="s2">these circumstances the revelation will</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.320" end="01:02:49.670" style="s2">be something too strong what I could</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.570" end="01:02:53.020" style="s2">bear that&#39;s a beautiful image you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.670" end="01:02:55.460" style="s2">given us Roger of blowing on the embers</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.020" end="01:02:59.090" style="s2">within blowing on the embers of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.460" end="01:03:02.480" style="s2">transcendence I&#39;d ask you both about the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.090" end="01:03:06.050" style="s2">forms of culture and institutional life</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.480" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">that produce that blowing on the embers</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.050" end="01:03:11.240" style="s2">in the individual it seems to me both of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:13.400" style="s2">you have a very deep sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.240" end="01:03:16.580" style="s2">dignity of the human individual of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:23.600" end="01:03:29.060" style="s2">culture that we would say to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.910" end="01:03:34.460" style="s2">necessary or most most inclined to</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.460" end="01:03:41.240" style="s2">the flame well I think the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.250" end="01:03:43.990" style="s2">accessible form for most people is music</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.240" end="01:03:46.580" style="s2">and music to me is the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.990" end="01:03:48.050" style="s2">representational form of art because I</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.580" end="01:03:51.320" style="s2">think that the world is made out of</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.050" end="01:03:52.970" style="s2">patterns and we perceive some patterns</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.320" end="01:03:56.180" style="s2">as objects but fundamentally its</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.970" end="01:03:57.470" style="s2">patterns and what you want is all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.180" end="01:04:00.230" style="s2">patterns of the world to interact</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.470" end="01:04:02.690" style="s2">harmoniously and in something where</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.230" end="01:04:04.550" style="s2">every element is related intelligibly to</p>

<p begin="01:04:04.550" end="01:04:08.780" style="s2">when your life is in harmony that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.590" end="01:04:10.670" style="s2">can feel that and when you&#39;re dancing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.780" end="01:04:13.910" style="s2">beautiful music you&#39;re acting that out</p>

<p begin="01:05:50.990" end="01:05:57.220" style="s2">dancing is an extremely important</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.960" end="01:06:02.150" style="s2">phenomenon partly because traditionally</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.220" end="01:06:04.540" style="s2">dancing was dancing with someone the</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.440" end="01:06:17.060" style="s2">the witness of the dance is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.810" end="01:06:18.530" style="s2">something real we see it in Scottish</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.060" end="01:06:21.020" style="s2">reels and things like that where the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.530" end="01:06:24.050" style="s2">whole community is dancing in an orderly</p>

<p begin="01:06:24.050" end="01:06:29.180" style="s2">and order and taking pleasure in it now</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.020" end="01:06:33.350" style="s2">I find that a very near to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.180" end="01:06:36.020" style="s2">transcendent experience I feel a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.350" end="01:06:39.320" style="s2">narcissism has crept into them the dance</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.020" end="01:06:42.890" style="s2">through recent forms of dance music but</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.320" end="01:06:48.650" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s my old geezer attitude or</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.890" end="01:06:51.890" style="s2">or is or is or is it simply to say that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.650" end="01:06:53.960" style="s2">there that that the principle itself is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.890" end="01:06:57.970" style="s2">sovereign everyone thinks about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.960" end="01:06:57.970" style="s2">logic for example of Dante&#39;s Inferno</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.150" end="01:07:03.089" style="s2">which because evermore degraded forms of</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.640" end="01:07:10.829" style="s2">knowing and loving</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.089" end="01:07:12.239" style="s2">that that the mechanism of the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.829" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">nature you might say the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.239" end="01:07:17.940" style="s2">soul is the same at the top of paradise</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:22.019" style="s2">as it is at the at the bottom of Inferno</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.940" end="01:07:24.420" style="s2">but it has these infinite gradations of</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.019" end="01:07:26.460" style="s2">wholeness and so I don&#39;t think we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.420" end="01:07:30.930" style="s2">to say that that that the the mosh pit</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.460" end="01:07:34.739" style="s2">is is is is is equivalent as a work of</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.930" end="01:07:37.650" style="s2">art to to Beethoven or Palestrina or</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.739" end="01:07:40.619" style="s2">Yana check but rather that perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.650" end="01:07:43.140" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in in in that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.619" end="01:07:45.180" style="s2">nonetheless a longing for the pattern</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.140" end="01:07:48.180" style="s2">and the the recognition of the other</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.180" end="01:07:50.640" style="s2">that you use you say but but yes but</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.180" end="01:07:54.660" style="s2">your original question was how do we how</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:57.239" style="s2">do we coax people back into that into a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.660" end="01:07:58.950" style="s2">life which is based on the recognition</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.239" end="01:08:00.660" style="s2">of the other rather than the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.950" end="01:08:02.009" style="s2">gratification of the self because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.660" end="01:08:05.519" style="s2">essentially what we&#39;re talking about I</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.009" end="01:08:09.779" style="s2">think within today at least</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.519" end="01:08:14.940" style="s2">and I would say teaching people how to</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.779" end="01:08:19.139" style="s2">help others the role of the teacher it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.940" end="01:08:21.630" style="s2">a very dignified one but it it is only</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.139" end="01:08:24.810" style="s2">so if the teacher actually thinks that</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.630" end="01:08:28.139" style="s2">he is helping the pupil to a body of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.810" end="01:08:31.380" style="s2">knowledge that he has access to and that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.139" end="01:08:33.509" style="s2">sense of helping other people is a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.380" end="01:08:36.599" style="s2">rare thing and it&#39;s it&#39;s made more rare</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.509" end="01:08:41.609" style="s2">by the the welfare state and the ready</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.599" end="01:08:44.969" style="s2">availability of subsidies for subsidized</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.609" end="01:08:48.960" style="s2">life without leaning on any particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.969" end="01:08:51.750" style="s2">person you know and I think relations of</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.960" end="01:08:54.119" style="s2">dependence are actually very positive if</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.750" end="01:08:56.369" style="s2">they are accepted on both sides you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.119" end="01:08:58.889" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s something that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.369" end="01:09:01.560" style="s2">teach and the boy scouts movement and</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.889" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">all that they used to teach young people</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.560" end="01:09:07.049" style="s2">these things teach people how to go out</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:09.060" style="s2">and help those who needed them and how</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.049" end="01:09:13.170" style="s2">to make those little Saturday to day</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.060" end="01:09:16.109" style="s2">sacrifices and eventually through the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.170" end="01:09:20.310" style="s2">process of imitation and imagination</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.109" end="01:09:22.380" style="s2">a character grows based on that I feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.310" end="01:09:25.409" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t any obstacle to this</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.380" end="01:09:27.089" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple form of Education all</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.409" end="01:09:30.630" style="s2">of us can do it and all of us who have</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.089" end="01:09:32.850" style="s2">children do do it I&#39;m sure Jordan does</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.630" end="01:09:35.159" style="s2">it with his children the same as I with</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.850" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">mine of course it you know you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.159" end="01:09:39.900" style="s2">disappointed they always go away into</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.900" end="01:09:46.350" style="s2">wretched little iPhones and so on but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.420" end="01:09:48.989" style="s2">nevertheless it some of it rubs off and</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.350" end="01:09:52.469" style="s2">you know that in the long run they will</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.989" end="01:09:55.230" style="s2">be capable not just of finding love but</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.469" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">also of offering forgiveness and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.230" end="01:10:01.980" style="s2">working for reconciliation I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:04.469" style="s2">in the sort of narcissistic culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.980" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">which is propagated by the media and by</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.469" end="01:10:11.040" style="s2">the universities that that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:14.130" style="s2">pointed in that direction that is true</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.040" end="01:10:16.860" style="s2">but then it&#39;s up to us to point them in</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.130" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">another direction I think as an academic</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.860" end="01:10:21.540" style="s2">we talked already about that place where</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:23.880" style="s2">the meaning and the fact are conjoined</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.540" end="01:10:26.750" style="s2">and that&#39;s the proper place to lecture</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.880" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">from because people who lecture</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.750" end="01:10:32.639" style="s2">constantly make the presumption that</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:35.010" style="s2">they&#39;re there to deliver a set of facts</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.639" end="01:10:36.989" style="s2">but there&#39;s an infinite set of facts and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.010" end="01:10:39.119" style="s2">so at the very least you have to select</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.989" end="01:10:41.639" style="s2">the facts and there&#39;s a mechanism that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.119" end="01:10:44.610" style="s2">selects the facts what what you want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.639" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">do as an academic is is tell your</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.610" end="01:10:50.010" style="s2">students through through direct</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.280" end="01:10:51.810" style="s2">discourse and also through action about</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.010" end="01:10:54.480" style="s2">something that you&#39;ve encountered that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.810" end="01:10:56.369" style="s2">that you&#39;ve fallen in love with and to</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.480" end="01:10:57.750" style="s2">and to communicate the love that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.369" end="01:11:00.060" style="s2">have for that the love for literature</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.750" end="01:11:01.980" style="s2">and and not to say well you should read</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.060" end="01:11:04.290" style="s2">this book but to say well here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.980" end="01:11:06.179" style="s2">book and here&#39;s what it can open up for</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.290" end="01:11:08.580" style="s2">you and this is how it does it and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.179" end="01:11:10.290" style="s2">this is what you&#39;ll gain from it it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.580" end="01:11:12.750" style="s2">inestimable gain and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.290" end="01:11:15.389" style="s2">struggle in it but but there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.750" end="01:11:17.310" style="s2">something in it that&#39;s of unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.389" end="01:11:19.260" style="s2">utility and you have to believe that in</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.310" end="01:11:21.210" style="s2">order to communicate it and then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.260" end="01:11:22.590" style="s2">hope that opens one of those doors you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.210" end="01:11:24.150" style="s2">know and maybe some students will step</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.590" end="01:11:25.830" style="s2">through that and think well maybe that</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.150" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">sounds like something I need I&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.830" end="01:11:29.880" style="s2">dire situation and I need something I</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:31.620" style="s2">need a life raft</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.880" end="01:11:33.239" style="s2">need a they need something to boy me</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.620" end="01:11:35.250" style="s2">upward and it&#39;s going to take some</p>

<p begin="01:13:01.080" end="01:13:07.350" style="s2">out and you will love it too whereas the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.199" end="01:13:11.460" style="s2">postmodern a curriculum is a curriculum</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.350" end="01:13:13.500" style="s2">of hatred it&#39;s directed against our</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.460" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">cultural inheritance one after another</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.500" end="01:13:20.670" style="s2">the works are paraded before us stripped</p>

<p begin="01:13:23.429" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">structure is being concealed within them</p>

<p begin="01:13:34.290" end="01:13:39.499" style="s2">best of us could produce and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.300" end="01:13:42.019" style="s2">nothing why should you bother doing it</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.499" end="01:13:44.300" style="s2">and it means that students who go</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.019" end="01:13:46.280" style="s2">through that curriculum come out with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.300" end="01:13:50.119" style="s2">sense of the hopelessness of everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.280" end="01:13:52.219" style="s2">and thus are successfully educated by</p>

<p begin="01:13:52.219" end="01:13:57.139" style="s2">suppose that&#39;s right but you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.010" end="01:14:00.260" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason why one should one</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.139" end="01:14:05.329" style="s2">should accept this one all all good</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.260" end="01:14:08.420" style="s2">things begin in the in small areas</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.329" end="01:14:10.460" style="s2">because because two or three people you</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.420" end="01:14:12.679" style="s2">know well as Christ said two or three</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.460" end="01:14:17.090" style="s2">are gathered in my name you know there</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.679" end="01:14:19.219" style="s2">am i with you but the same is is in all</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.090" end="01:14:23.210" style="s2">cultural activities it&#39;s a perhaps a</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.219" end="01:14:25.789" style="s2">friendship will will be game it will</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.210" end="01:14:27.610" style="s2">start up a reading group and out of that</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.789" end="01:14:30.739" style="s2">reading group there&#39;ll be others come in</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.610" end="01:14:32.749" style="s2">gradually if it&#39;s founded on love of the</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.749" end="01:14:37.489" style="s2">it will always triumph in the long run</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.729" end="01:14:40.219" style="s2">over this negativity the problem is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.489" end="01:14:42.199" style="s2">negativity is subsidized is subsidized</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.219" end="01:14:43.909" style="s2">by universities who are paid for by</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.199" end="01:14:47.749" style="s2">governments who are paid for by</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.909" end="01:14:50.690" style="s2">taxpayers and so on and the the answer</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.749" end="01:14:53.119" style="s2">is to take away those subsidies and and</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.690" end="01:14:55.969" style="s2">deprive education completely of money</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.119" end="01:14:58.849" style="s2">and it will be back with us again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.969" end="01:15:01.820" style="s2">right I super I suggested something like</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.849" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">that in public in Canada not so long ago</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.820" end="01:15:05.690" style="s2">to cut the budgets of the universities</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:08.150" style="s2">across the board by 25 percent and let</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.690" end="01:15:11.150" style="s2">them sort themselves out because but the</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.150" end="01:15:14.360" style="s2">the no subsidy idea at least forces</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.150" end="01:15:16.400" style="s2">those who provide education to do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.360" end="01:15:19.460" style="s2">purely on its merits and the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:21.320" style="s2">these counterproductive disciplines</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.460" end="01:15:23.389" style="s2">let&#39;s say have been subsidized for so</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.320" end="01:15:25.639" style="s2">long has given them a power that&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.389" end="01:15:29.719" style="s2">far outstrips their their credibility</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.639" end="01:15:34.070" style="s2">and their attractiveness alright now I</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.719" end="01:15:36.769" style="s2">wanted to to point out will this this</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.070" end="01:15:39.590" style="s2">this chat may be seen by a few people</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.130" end="01:16:13.380" style="s2">I&#39;d like to ask you both about memory</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.449" end="01:16:16.440" style="s2">and the inheritance of the past and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.380" end="01:16:17.969" style="s2">what it means to have a pedagogy what it</p>

<p begin="01:16:30.780" end="01:16:37.170" style="s2">that you love that you&#39;ve been able to</p>

<p begin="01:16:39.960" end="01:16:44.519" style="s2">remember the Armistice in the First</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.269" end="01:16:47.849" style="s2">World War one of the reasons is is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.519" end="01:16:51.690" style="s2">gratitude and gratitude is in short</p>

<p begin="01:16:51.690" end="01:16:56.610" style="s2">the it&#39;s the the greatest gift that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.239" end="01:16:59.150" style="s2">can offer in fact as sorts of people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.610" end="01:17:01.110" style="s2">are dead because what else can we do</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.150" end="01:17:04.650" style="s2">except to acknowledge what their</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.110" end="01:17:08.610" style="s2">sacrifice so I think that gratitude is a</p>

<p begin="01:19:46.199" end="01:19:53.340" style="s2">that when you listen to a theme in music</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.910" end="01:19:56.730" style="s2">you are not listening to a sequence of</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.340" end="01:20:00.239" style="s2">notes something begins in that first</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.730" end="01:20:02.790" style="s2">note and endures to the final note and</p>

<p begin="01:20:11.040" end="01:20:17.130" style="s2">is already a contribution that we make</p>

<p begin="01:21:07.980" end="01:21:13.590" style="s2">way as we value tragedy because it gives</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.500" end="01:21:16.170" style="s2">completion and closure to things that</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.590" end="01:21:17.640" style="s2">otherwise wouldn&#39;t ever have them and</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.170" end="01:21:19.500" style="s2">things that are transient as well</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.640" end="01:21:21.810" style="s2">because it does have a beginning and an</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.150" end="01:21:29.490" style="s2">right hmm so in the gratitude I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.480" end="01:21:30.840" style="s2">that was that was exactly the theme that</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.490" end="01:21:32.280" style="s2">sprung to mind for me</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.840" end="01:21:34.320" style="s2">as soon as you asked that question I</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.280" end="01:21:37.460" style="s2">mean one of the things that I found find</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.320" end="01:21:41.100" style="s2">profoundly disquieting about the modern</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.460" end="01:21:45.480" style="s2">radical what would you call it ideology</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.100" end="01:21:47.340" style="s2">that is so no so unfortunately dominant</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.480" end="01:21:50.780" style="s2">on campuses among young people is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.340" end="01:21:53.250" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievably ungrateful and when I</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.780" end="01:21:56.730" style="s2">when I walk outside and there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.250" end="01:21:57.480" style="s2">riot and death in the streets I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.730" end="01:22:00.290" style="s2">a good day</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.480" end="01:22:04.350" style="s2">that&#39;s my sense of history it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.290" end="01:22:07.710" style="s2">constantly staggered by the fact that so</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.350" end="01:22:10.920" style="s2">much works all the time it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.710" end="01:22:12.450" style="s2">I met this guy a while back and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.920" end="01:22:14.640" style="s2">been in a motorcycle accident</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.450" end="01:22:16.950" style="s2">he really got hurt man he was he was</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.640" end="01:22:19.110" style="s2">pretty much half destroyed and he worked</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.950" end="01:22:21.390" style="s2">as a telephone lineman he worked with</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.110" end="01:22:23.730" style="s2">this guy who had Parkinson&#39;s disease who</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.390" end="01:22:25.110" style="s2">had was equally destroyed in a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.730" end="01:22:27.120" style="s2">different way and the two of them</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.110" end="01:22:29.280" style="s2">together could climb up a telephone pole</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.120" end="01:22:31.170" style="s2">and continue their job and I thought</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.280" end="01:22:31.640" style="s2">this unbelievable infrastructure we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.170" end="01:22:33.890" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.640" end="01:22:36.920" style="s2">just an absolute bloody unknowing</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.890" end="01:22:38.900" style="s2">ongoing miracle is sustained by people</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.920" end="01:22:41.150" style="s2">exactly like that you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.900" end="01:22:43.310" style="s2">having very difficult lives in a country</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.150" end="01:22:45.260" style="s2">like Canada they go out in the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.310" end="01:22:48.560" style="s2">the bloody winter where you die it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.260" end="01:22:50.420" style="s2">frigid and something breaks and they fix</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.560" end="01:22:53.210" style="s2">it and the lights are on the lights are</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.420" end="01:22:57.160" style="s2">on all the time and I come to somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.210" end="01:22:59.780" style="s2">like Europe and to me it&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.160" end="01:23:01.640" style="s2">overwhelming experience to see Kings</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.780" end="01:23:04.220" style="s2">Chapel today to wander around this city</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.640" end="01:23:08.390" style="s2">I just staggered that people produce</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.220" end="01:23:10.700" style="s2">this and so amazed that we could do it</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.390" end="01:23:12.650" style="s2">and so grateful that it exists it we</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.700" end="01:23:14.540" style="s2">were talking about King&#39;s chapel the</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.650" end="01:23:16.310" style="s2">people who started it didn&#39;t live to see</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.540" end="01:23:19.160" style="s2">its completion they were they were</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.310" end="01:23:21.080" style="s2">driven by this nobility of transcendent</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.160" end="01:23:24.260" style="s2">vision and they produced these enduring</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.080" end="01:23:26.210" style="s2">forms and out of the bloody misery of</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.260" end="01:23:29.660" style="s2">history we&#39;ve erected all this</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.210" end="01:23:32.180" style="s2">spectacular infrastructure that we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.660" end="01:23:34.850" style="s2">fortunate to be part of them the none of</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.180" end="01:23:37.010" style="s2">that gratitude is taught and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.850" end="01:23:40.460" style="s2">not taught because people have no sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.010" end="01:23:43.520" style="s2">of the absolute catastrophe of history I</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.460" end="01:23:46.610" style="s2">mean for me the Hobbs it&#39;s like nasty</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.520" end="01:23:49.780" style="s2">brutish and short that the simplest and</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.610" end="01:23:53.030" style="s2">most likely social circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.780" end="01:23:55.670" style="s2">catastrophe punctuated by hell and to</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.030" end="01:23:57.830" style="s2">see that not happening in a sustained</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.670" end="01:24:00.530" style="s2">manner constantly and to see things</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.830" end="01:24:02.930" style="s2">improving around us and and to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.530" end="01:24:04.640" style="s2">reliable in that manner and then not to</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.930" end="01:24:06.650" style="s2">be grateful for that it&#39;s like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.640" end="01:24:08.780" style="s2">unbelievable combination of ignorance</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.710" end="01:24:20.810" style="s2">this and to be open mouthed in</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.840" end="01:24:24.830" style="s2">non-ironic amazement at what&#39;s here and</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.810" end="01:24:26.570" style="s2">so and to not instill that sense and</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.830" end="01:24:29.260" style="s2">young people to for them to understand</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.570" end="01:24:31.520" style="s2">that they are standing on the bones of</p>

<p begin="01:24:33.440" end="01:24:38.920" style="s2">errors and have brought this forward</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.060" end="01:24:42.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah well Hobbs is a very</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.920" end="01:24:43.880" style="s2">salutary lesson actually because he did</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.350" end="01:24:46.699" style="s2">look into the abyss</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.880" end="01:24:50.989" style="s2">and stepped back from it and reported on</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.699" end="01:24:57.650" style="s2">it and and we and as did Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.989" end="01:24:59.810" style="s2">and we post-war baby boomers haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.650" end="01:25:01.909" style="s2">that experience and I had a little</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.810" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">glimpse of it in the old communist days</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.909" end="01:25:08.540" style="s2">but we only saw the edge of it then you</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:11.150" style="s2">know but still the scent the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.540" end="01:25:15.590" style="s2">it is there always beneath your feet and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.150" end="01:25:17.690" style="s2">that the crust is as thin as it it can</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.590" end="01:25:19.610" style="s2">be in certain places that I think is</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.690" end="01:25:21.560" style="s2">something that young people do need to</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.610" end="01:25:24.560" style="s2">be taught without making them get gloomy</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.560" end="01:25:27.949" style="s2">about it but to recognize that they</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.560" end="01:25:31.639" style="s2">they&#39;re lucky a last question before we</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.949" end="01:25:32.900" style="s2">open up for a few questions here it</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.639" end="01:25:35.000" style="s2">seems to me that the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.900" end="01:25:37.179" style="s2">backward-looking that we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.000" end="01:25:41.239" style="s2">you had a wonderful phrase a wide-eyed</p>

<p begin="01:26:01.730" end="01:26:05.030" style="s2">those who would finish and those who</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.500" end="01:26:07.880" style="s2">finished knew they had inherited to work</p>

<p begin="01:26:07.880" end="01:26:13.370" style="s2">so I suppose I want to ask we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.120" end="01:26:15.500" style="s2">about the the the the necessity to turn</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.370" end="01:26:18.920" style="s2">back with gratitude to the Past to our</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.500" end="01:26:21.020" style="s2">inherited past and I want to talk also</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.920" end="01:26:24.469" style="s2">about the possibility of building in a</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.020" end="01:26:26.330" style="s2">creation these chapels and buildings</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.469" end="01:26:30.020" style="s2">were built at some time you yourself are</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.330" end="01:26:33.590" style="s2">a composer both of you authors of books</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.020" end="01:26:37.270" style="s2">that many many people have found depth</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.590" end="01:26:40.580" style="s2">and truth in so I want to to ask about</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.270" end="01:26:43.880" style="s2">the possibilities for for for</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.580" end="01:26:47.690" style="s2">Renaissance for rebuilding or building a</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.880" end="01:26:50.630" style="s2">new at new buildings new forms of</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.690" end="01:26:52.070" style="s2">community new forms of art perhaps new</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.630" end="01:26:56.420" style="s2">buildings of old forms of architecture</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.070" end="01:26:59.540" style="s2">new colleges and universities new</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.420" end="01:27:03.599" style="s2">more healthy and beautiful forms of</p>

<p begin="01:27:03.599" end="01:27:09.599" style="s2">and music it seems to me so important</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.530" end="01:27:14.400" style="s2">that that we not lose sight of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.599" end="01:27:19.530" style="s2">that precisely the abiding truth of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:22.739" style="s2">transcendent in us gives us hope to to</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.530" end="01:27:26.520" style="s2">answer that call yeah it must be the</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.739" end="01:27:29.130" style="s2">case that when when describing our</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.520" end="01:27:32.550" style="s2">cultural inheritance we are not just</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.130" end="01:27:34.080" style="s2">describing something that&#39;s gone we must</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.550" end="01:27:37.080" style="s2">be describing something of which we are</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.080" end="01:27:39.330" style="s2">still apart and which we which has to</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.080" end="01:27:41.790" style="s2">changed as we are changing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.330" end="01:27:44.280" style="s2">accommodate us all this was said by</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.790" end="01:27:46.909" style="s2">Eliot in tradition and the individual</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.280" end="01:27:50.130" style="s2">talent you know that that the artist</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.909" end="01:27:52.440" style="s2">must be constantly trying to say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.130" end="01:27:55.020" style="s2">new thing that that he came into the</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.440" end="01:27:58.679" style="s2">world to say but he can only say it if</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.020" end="01:28:01.440" style="s2">he adapts his style to the the</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.679" end="01:28:03.030" style="s2">inheritance of the tradition thereby</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.440" end="01:28:06.270" style="s2">transforming the tradition and</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.030" end="01:28:08.040" style="s2">transforming himself and we all there</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.270" end="01:28:10.230" style="s2">and there is no formula for doing this</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.040" end="01:28:14.580" style="s2">because a formula is precisely what what</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.230" end="01:28:17.790" style="s2">destroys the creative act but we have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.580" end="01:28:20.880" style="s2">assume that new things will come and</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.790" end="01:28:23.610" style="s2">they will come through as as they always</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.880" end="01:28:27.750" style="s2">did in the past through fasting and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.610" end="01:28:35.190" style="s2">prayer you know and the occasional glass</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.750" end="01:28:37.739" style="s2">of wine in my case Jordan well we could</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.190" end="01:28:39.989" style="s2">concentrate I suppose on building the</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.739" end="01:28:43.610" style="s2">future instead of criticizing the past</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.989" end="01:28:46.230" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s necessary to decompose to</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.610" end="01:28:48.599" style="s2">reconstruct you know those those acts</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.230" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">can&#39;t be separated but the decomposition</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.599" end="01:28:52.530" style="s2">is the prerequisite for the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.400" end="01:28:54.750" style="s2">reconstruction and you know what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.530" end="01:28:57.060" style="s2">been recommending to people is that they</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.750" end="01:28:58.739" style="s2">they start on whatever scale they can</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.060" end="01:29:00.150" style="s2">start on with whatever&#39;s in front of</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.739" end="01:29:02.760" style="s2">them because they have more in front of</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.150" end="01:29:04.860" style="s2">them than they think these these these</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.760" end="01:29:06.989" style="s2">these circumscribed areas that these</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.860" end="01:29:08.890" style="s2">small places that people can call their</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.989" end="01:29:10.930" style="s2">own even if it&#39;s the only their room</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.890" end="01:29:12.880" style="s2">you can start to do something creative</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.930" end="01:29:14.650" style="s2">and beautiful there I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.880" end="01:29:16.360" style="s2">suggested to people that they start by</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.650" end="01:29:18.580" style="s2">putting the room in order and that</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.360" end="01:29:20.350" style="s2">implies a purpose it&#39;s like well your</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.580" end="01:29:22.120" style="s2">room is somewhere that you exist it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.350" end="01:29:24.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a place that surrounds you</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.120" end="01:29:26.280" style="s2">that tells you how to be is put it in</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.250" end="01:29:28.680" style="s2">order so at least it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.280" end="01:29:31.810" style="s2">screaming chaos at you in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.680" end="01:29:34.990" style="s2">soul-destroying manner make it pristine</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.810" end="01:29:36.940" style="s2">and and and and orderly in in a fashion</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.990" end="01:29:39.580" style="s2">that suits what you&#39;re aiming at so have</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.940" end="01:29:41.560" style="s2">a name and then this is perhaps a</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.580" end="01:29:43.210" style="s2">chapter in my next book well maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.560" end="01:29:45.190" style="s2">start by putting your room in order and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.210" end="01:29:46.480" style="s2">then you make it beautiful and then you</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.190" end="01:29:48.370" style="s2">learn how to make something beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.480" end="01:29:50.710" style="s2">and to make something beautiful is to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.370" end="01:29:52.600" style="s2">make it worthwhile and to participate in</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.710" end="01:29:55.380" style="s2">that transcendent meet and in that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.600" end="01:29:57.850" style="s2">transcendence maybe you need one</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.380" end="01:30:00.550" style="s2">certainly and for your future self which</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.850" end="01:30:03.220" style="s2">is also others you know this idea that</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.550" end="01:30:05.440" style="s2">people are fed even of self</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.220" end="01:30:07.540" style="s2">gratification let&#39;s say as an antidote</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.440" end="01:30:09.430" style="s2">to nihilism well take your pleasure in</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.540" end="01:30:11.320" style="s2">the moment it doesn&#39;t even work for you</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.430" end="01:30:14.380" style="s2">because you&#39;re stuck with you tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.320" end="01:30:16.180" style="s2">and you next week and so even to treat</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.380" end="01:30:18.340" style="s2">yourself properly is to treat yourself</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.180" end="01:30:22.060" style="s2">as part of an ongoing community but I</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.340" end="01:30:25.210" style="s2">would say start by you start in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.060" end="01:30:29.110" style="s2">world if you have some wisdom and some</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.210" end="01:30:31.980" style="s2">humility by taking the potential that</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.110" end="01:30:34.660" style="s2">lies dormant in front of you and</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.980" end="01:30:37.770" style="s2">interacting with it in the logos like</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.660" end="01:30:39.580" style="s2">manner with truth and with love and by</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.770" end="01:30:41.650" style="s2">transforming that potential into</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.580" end="01:30:44.860" style="s2">whatever you can create out of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.650" end="01:30:46.750" style="s2">good and even if it&#39;s it won&#39;t be small</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.860" end="01:30:48.430" style="s2">if you do that you can transform your</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.750" end="01:30:49.930" style="s2">whole household by transforming your</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.430" end="01:30:51.640" style="s2">room you can transform your whole</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.930" end="01:30:53.440" style="s2">neighborhood by transforming your house</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.640" end="01:30:55.930" style="s2">like these things spread very very</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.440" end="01:30:58.390" style="s2">rapidly and that is right there in front</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.930" end="01:31:00.640" style="s2">of you you know and people think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.390" end="01:31:02.560" style="s2">impoverished now that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.640" end="01:31:04.510" style="s2">any opportunity and that and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.560" end="01:31:06.850" style="s2">opportunity is hidden from them by their</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.510" end="01:31:09.460" style="s2">by their by their unwillingness to take</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.850" end="01:31:11.590" style="s2">the steps that are necessary to put what</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.460" end="01:31:14.710" style="s2">they could put in front of them in order</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.590" end="01:31:16.240" style="s2">and and and to and to produce the beauty</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.710" end="01:31:18.010" style="s2">instead of the ugliness where they could</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.240" end="01:31:19.780" style="s2">do that and I don&#39;t think there is</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.010" end="01:31:22.350" style="s2">anything more powerful than that that</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.780" end="01:31:23.430" style="s2">works I&#39;ve had thousands of people</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.350" end="01:31:25.560" style="s2">tell me that it works you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.430" end="01:31:27.750" style="s2">personally and come and talk to me every</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.560" end="01:31:30.000" style="s2">day now on the street and say my life</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.750" end="01:31:31.740" style="s2">was in terrible disorder I had no vision</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.000" end="01:31:33.420" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t abiding by the truth my</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.740" end="01:31:35.730" style="s2">relationships were fragmented I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.420" end="01:31:37.140" style="s2">decided to make something of myself</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.730" end="01:31:38.490" style="s2">whatever that might be</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.140" end="01:31:40.350" style="s2">I&#39;ve decided to adopt more</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.490" end="01:31:43.890" style="s2">responsibility and to tell the truth and</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.350" end="01:31:46.140" style="s2">things are incomparably better and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.890" end="01:31:48.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s there for everyone to take</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.140" end="01:31:50.790" style="s2">and regardless of your circumstances and</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.480" end="01:31:53.220" style="s2">I know that some people have what appear</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.790" end="01:31:54.840" style="s2">to be larger opportunities and more</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.220" end="01:31:56.670" style="s2">privileged in front of them but that</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.840" end="01:31:59.070" style="s2">also makes they&#39;re commensurate and</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.670" end="01:32:01.110" style="s2">moral responsibility larger so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.070" end="01:32:05.010" style="s2">certain balancing that&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.110" end="01:32:07.380" style="s2">consequence of that so now recognizing</p>
