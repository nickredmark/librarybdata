<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.120" style="s2">The next story, one of Cain and Abel, and it plays on that because in a very interesting way because</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.549" end="00:00:10.379" style="s2">It indicates what happens and I would say it it</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.080" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">What supports my general hypothesis about what the first story means because what happens with Cain and Abel?</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:20.340" style="s2">Is that well, they&#39;re brothers, right? And...</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.520" end="00:00:26.729" style="s2">so hypothetically the first two real human beings. And they don&#39;t really like each other.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.220" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">Abel is a good guy by all appearances.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.849" end="00:00:33.479" style="s2">God smiles on him, fate smiles on him.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.480" end="00:00:38.099" style="s2">How about if we put it that way - everything that he does seems to work out. Well, he makes</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.770" end="00:00:46.680" style="s2">sacrifices which the text insists upon and the sacrifices are rewarded by God. That&#39;s a very very very very</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.200" end="00:00:49.000" style="s2">important crucial</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.000" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">document because we already noted that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.620" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">had discovered time in</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:01:00.779" style="s2">Genesis, they discovered the duration of their life and the existence of death and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.940" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">necessity for toil and by the time we get to Cain and Abel human beings have discovered in this dramatic manner that if they make</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.159" end="00:01:11.249" style="s2">sacrifices in the present that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.560" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">hypothetically, the future can be better and that&#39;s that&#39;s like, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s not the major discovery of mankind -</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly among the top one or two,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.820" end="00:01:27.299" style="s2">because it&#39;s very it&#39;s really something for a creature for an animal like us to notice</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.880" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">that if we give up something that we want right now -</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.180" end="00:01:35.879" style="s2">we can sort of bargain with fate, as it were, to get something better in the future.</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.159" end="00:01:38.789" style="s2">And that&#39;s really what you do when you work, right?</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:39.850" style="s2">Because when you work,</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.850" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">by definition, you&#39;re doing things that you&#39;d rather not do right now because otherwise, it wouldn&#39;t be work.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:49.769" style="s2">And the reason that you&#39;re doing that is because you think: &quot;well if I give up what I really want to do,</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.990" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">impulsively right now, then over the medium to long term, things will be better.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">And so you learn, you believe that making the appropriate sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.719" end="00:02:02.519" style="s2">propitiates God, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.189" end="00:02:04.810" style="s2">metaphorically, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.810" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">Abel&#39;s sacrifices work, man.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.909" end="00:02:08.709" style="s2">Everything he touches turns to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.709" end="00:02:15.809" style="s2">sheep and camels, and women, and he has everything he wants. And everyone likes him, and everybody thinks he&#39;s a good guy. And</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:21.449" style="s2">you know, that&#39;s pretty good for Abel, but Cain isn&#39;t doing so well and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.209" end="00:02:24.160" style="s2">nothing he</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.160" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">sacrifices appears to have the proper effect and there is some idea in the story that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.489" end="00:02:34.079" style="s2">sacrifices he makes are a little bit on the half-hearted side. And</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.300" end="00:02:42.089" style="s2">that God isn&#39;t all that thrilled at those sacrifices as a consequence. And that&#39;s really we&#39;re thinking about again for about 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.580" end="00:02:44.140" style="s2">because it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.140" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">possible that if you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:51.400" style="s2">sacrifices and they&#39;re not working out that well that it&#39;s not so much that God hates you -</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:57.980" style="s2">it&#39;s that your sacrifices could be of a somewhat higher quality, right? That you&#39;re playing a game</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.420" end="00:03:03.480" style="s2">with yourself and with the structure of reality and you think you can get away with it. And</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.730" end="00:03:09.509" style="s2">you can&#39;t, and the fact that you&#39;re not getting away with it and that you can&#39;t - makes you bitter and resentful,</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.670" end="00:03:11.670" style="s2">and cruel, and vengeful, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.130" end="00:03:13.180" style="s2">homicidal</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.180" end="00:03:17.250" style="s2">eventually. And worse than that because there are far worse places than you can go,</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">that you can go, than merely homicidal. Anyways, Cain has enough of this one day</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.200" end="00:03:28.679" style="s2">and he says to... he, Cain, decides to have a chat with God and it goes something like this -</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:32.070" style="s2">it&#39;s quite an arrogant chat, really.</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.860" end="00:03:36.539" style="s2">It&#39;s almost as arrogant as Adam&#39;s was stupid.</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.299" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">And Cain basically challenges God. He says look, I don&#39;t know what sort of world you think you put together here, but</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.430" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve got Abel and we&#39;ve got me and like everything&#39;s just working out for him</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.190" end="00:03:57.630" style="s2">He&#39;s perfectly goddamn delightful and everyone likes him and and whatever he touches</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.900" end="00:04:02.540" style="s2">like King Midas turns to gold and it&#39;s all easy for him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.340" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">then there&#39;s me and I&#39;m like breaking myself in half here and I&#39;m offering up my</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.740" end="00:04:13.000" style="s2">sacrifices and like you turn your nose up at them and nothing works out for me. And</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.930" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">implying, by the way, that it&#39;s God&#39;s fault. I would say more than implying -</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.780" end="00:04:21.669" style="s2">stating quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.669" end="00:04:26.848" style="s2">forthrightly that it&#39;s God&#39;s fault which, you know, takes a certain degree of arrogance</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:28.419" style="s2">you might think and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.419" end="00:04:34.829" style="s2">that&#39;s also worth thinking about for a very long period of time because it is possible that if things are going well for</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:38.099" style="s2">someone that you know and not going so well for you...</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.380" end="00:04:42.239" style="s2">That it is a consequence of the quality of your sacrifices.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.139" style="s2">And I don&#39;t want to push that too far because I know that people have bad luck,</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.139" end="00:04:53.459" style="s2">you know, because we are fragile creatures intrinsically and terrible things can happen to us on a somewhat random basis.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:55.460" style="s2">But it&#39;s still very much worth</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.750" end="00:05:00.419" style="s2">considering that&#39;s the rule in Chapter six: &quot;put your house in order before you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.419" end="00:05:03.689" style="s2">criticize the world&quot;. That</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.419" end="00:05:10.589" style="s2">the reason that things aren&#39;t turning out for you as well as they might - is because your sacrifices just</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.169" end="00:05:16.439" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough blood in them. They&#39;re just not what they should be.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.440" end="00:05:20.549" style="s2">You&#39;re not putting your full heart into it and as a consequence - you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.310" end="00:05:22.690" style="s2">reaping</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.690" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">the fee, you&#39;re not reaping the crop that you might otherwise so. And</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:33.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a harsh thing to think but that&#39;s actually what God tells Cain which is quite interesting. I read a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:37.289" style="s2">translations trying to understand this and what God basically says is:</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.020" end="00:05:40.020" style="s2">&quot;Look,</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.180" end="00:05:42.180" style="s2">buddy...</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.199" end="00:05:48.239" style="s2">Before you dare to criticize the creator of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.759" end="00:05:56.218" style="s2">the world or reality itself for that matter, you might give some thought to your own actions and here&#39;s how I look at it,</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.830" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">being God and all,</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.369" style="s2">You&#39;re in a house and there&#39;s a doorway and in the doorway</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:08.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a predatory cat and it&#39;s sexually aroused and it&#39;s after you. And</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:11.520" style="s2">you invite it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.860" end="00:06:15.479" style="s2">voluntarily. And you let it have its way with you. And</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.310" end="00:06:23.429" style="s2">something&#39;s produced as a consequence of that. That&#39;s well, you might say unholy,</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.009" end="00:06:26.819" style="s2">and what&#39;s the idea?.. and the idea is, well...</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.490" end="00:06:32.250" style="s2">It&#39;s sin that crouches out the door... and that means to miss the mark,</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">it means to make an error and it&#39;s something you have to invite into your life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:41.070" style="s2">But it isn&#39;t just that you invite it in and it stands with you...</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.080" end="00:06:46.500" style="s2">It&#39;s that you invited in - this malevolent way of being, and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.080" end="00:06:50.850" style="s2">you enter into a creative union with it?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.850" end="00:06:58.799" style="s2">That&#39;s symbolized in this particular story, using a sexual metaphor, and it&#39;s the combination of your perverse, will and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:04.709" style="s2">capacity for cruelty and malevolence that you meld together into something that&#39;s uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:07.440" style="s2">pathological and yours!&quot; And</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.810" end="00:07:13.739" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what God tells Cain: &quot;that&#39;s what you&#39;ve done and that&#39;s why your life isn&#39;t turning out as</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.990" end="00:07:18.419" style="s2">well as it might or as well as your brother&#39;s, and so why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.139" end="00:07:24.929" style="s2">get the hell out of my sight and think about that for a while?!&quot; And</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.720" end="00:07:29.970" style="s2">Cain leaves and he&#39;s not happy about it at all!</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.310" end="00:07:36.510" style="s2">Which is fully understandable because you know, if you&#39;re having a wretched time of it, then you&#39;re having a wretched time of it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.510" end="00:07:39.479" style="s2">And then if your brother&#39;s doing well, you know, that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.389" end="00:07:42.899" style="s2">salt in your wounds, man. And then...</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.419" end="00:07:50.669" style="s2">then maybe you could rationalize that because the world&#39;s unfair and your brother is lucky and you&#39;re unlucky... And all of that... and you can,</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.310" end="00:07:52.419" style="s2">you know,</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.419" end="00:07:56.609" style="s2">reserve a little bit of self-respect as a consequence of that rationalization,</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.620" end="00:08:00.959" style="s2">even though it&#39;s pretty thin, but then you decide to go and have it out with God and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.539" end="00:08:04.559" style="s2">he just basically says &quot;no, that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.200" end="00:08:08.039" style="s2">lies. And it&#39;s actually a hundred percent,</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.889" end="00:08:12.689" style="s2">not only a hundred percent your fault, but something that you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.330" end="00:08:17.820" style="s2">voluntarily and that you know, you did, and that you made far worse by</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.220" end="00:08:25.109" style="s2">doing it voluntarily and now you&#39;re lying about it and complaining about the structure of reality.&quot; And</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.690" end="00:08:33.239" style="s2">so, of all the bad news you could possibly get about why it is that things aren&#39;t going well for you, that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">the worst!</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:40.979" style="s2">Especially if it&#39;s actually delivered by God because then - it&#39;s hard to argue with.</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.500" end="00:08:51.479" style="s2">So what happens? Well, you&#39;d think that maybe if Cain had any sense (which he doesn&#39;t - he&#39;s too far gone) -</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:55.260" style="s2">he&#39;d go sit in a cave for about a decade, and eat</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:08:56.190" style="s2">locusts and honey,</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.190" end="00:09:00.179" style="s2">if he could find some, and think about all the terrible things he did, and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.460" end="00:09:08.280" style="s2">then come out and like apologize to Abel and to the people he didn&#39;t do well for, and like with a little humility -</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.310" end="00:09:14.429" style="s2">start again... and maybe have a life, but that isn&#39;t what happens...</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.100" end="00:09:20.700" style="s2">What happens is that he decides he&#39;s going to take revenge and he takes revenge in a terrible way.</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.040" end="00:09:24.750" style="s2">He kills Abel and then you think well, what does that mean?</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.810" end="00:09:27.929" style="s2">And this is a terrible story, right?</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:30.030" style="s2">Because it&#39;s really the first story about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.430" end="00:09:34.859" style="s2">that we have at the base of our culture. Because Adam and Eve were made by God,</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:42.300" style="s2">so they don&#39;t count. Cain and Abel - they were born - they count. And so the first story - is this terrible murder of a brother. And</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.550" end="00:09:46.830" style="s2">a murder that was motivated by jealousy and spite for</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.980" end="00:09:49.630" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.630" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">for for</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:53.190" style="s2">living positively in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.890" end="00:09:59.249" style="s2">Right? It&#39;s about the worst story you could imagine. And so Cain goes and kills Abel. And...</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.210" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">God, you know...</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.460" end="00:10:04.500" style="s2">asks him about it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.500" end="00:10:05.400" style="s2">And Cain says: &quot;Well,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.400" end="00:10:10.259" style="s2">am I my brother&#39;s keeper?&quot; And that doesn&#39;t work out so well because God has actually figured it out.</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.260" end="00:10:16.679" style="s2">And Cain says: &quot;my punishment is more than I can bear&quot;. And it might be because God has banished him.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.680" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">He&#39;s put a mark on him and banished him and told people to leave Cain the hell alone.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.530" end="00:10:25.290" style="s2">And I think that was to stop like a cycle of revenge killings,</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.290" end="00:10:28.709" style="s2">let&#39;s say, although it&#39;s complicated to say... but maybe his</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.260" end="00:10:33.989" style="s2">punishment is more than he can bear because there&#39;s a problem when you take your ideal,</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:36.780" style="s2">let&#39;s say, Abel (happens to be your brother).</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.780" end="00:10:42.419" style="s2">But your ideal, the person you really wish you could be, because that&#39;s what Cain wants, and then you kill it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.000" end="00:10:46.950" style="s2">You&#39;ve killed your ideal. You&#39;ve destroyed your ideal. And then what do you have?</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.170" end="00:10:52.110" style="s2">You&#39;ve got nothing because you need an ideal to live for and if you destroy your ideal -</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.610" end="00:10:54.450" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got nothing! And Cain says: &quot;well,</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.450" end="00:11:01.619" style="s2">my punishment is more than I can bear and maybe that&#39;s because life without that ideal is more than can be borne. And...</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:05.850" style="s2">Well...</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.040" end="00:11:08.559" style="s2">It gets worse from there really, because you know,</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:14.500" style="s2">it isn&#39;t only that Abel... that Cain killed Abel to get rid of Abel. That&#39;s bad enough.</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.080" end="00:11:19.629" style="s2">It&#39;s plenty bad. Even at the cost of his own soul, in some sense,</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.630" end="00:11:22.299" style="s2">which was something Cain was apparently willing to sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.610" end="00:11:28.479" style="s2">But the real reason that he did it was to shake his fists in anger at the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.000" end="00:11:32.380" style="s2">itself - the unfairness of being. And then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.690" end="00:11:37.330" style="s2">metaphorically represented as the proclivity to take revenge on God by destroying</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.880" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">God&#39;s ideal and so the story is even darker than mere murder because it goes farther down than just</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.470" end="00:11:49.870" style="s2">homicide. And if you&#39;re wondering why it is that people do the terrible things</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.870" end="00:11:53.859" style="s2">they do, that are truly terrible, the things that are almost incomprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.500" end="00:11:56.500" style="s2">terrible - you have to go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.600" end="00:12:03.339" style="s2">mere motivation for homicide and even torture and homicide and you have to look at the motivations that will turn</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.710" end="00:12:06.369" style="s2">human beings against being itself.</p>
