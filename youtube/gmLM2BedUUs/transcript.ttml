<p begin="00:00:03.850" end="00:00:07.690" style="s2">is they try to transmute it into fear</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.590" end="00:00:11.259" style="s2">because if they can transmute anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.690" end="00:00:15.490" style="s2">into fear then they can do something as</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.259" end="00:00:21.240" style="s2">opposed to just have that of ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.490" end="00:00:23.170" style="s2">and man that is an intense notion mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.240" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">one of the things that people do with</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.170" end="00:00:31.029" style="s2">anxiety is they transmuted into fear Wow</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:32.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s the in-depth and and that could</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.029" end="00:00:35.170" style="s2">that kind of feeds into the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.380" end="00:00:38.079" style="s2">generation because what conspiracies do</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.170" end="00:00:40.719" style="s2">as psychological adaptive mechanisms is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.079" end="00:00:43.180" style="s2">they translate existential anxiety into</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.719" end="00:00:46.149" style="s2">actionable fear because now there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.180" end="00:00:48.789" style="s2">threat whatever as the Cabal which which</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.149" end="00:00:50.949" style="s2">how it works however overwhelming is at</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.789" end="00:00:53.590" style="s2">least concrete enough that in principle</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.949" end="00:00:54.699" style="s2">agency is possible so you know I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.590" end="00:00:56.980" style="s2">sometimes call this the demonization</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.699" end="00:00:59.199" style="s2">strategy one of the ways you know it I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.980" end="00:01:01.750" style="s2">sometimes say to people I mean this sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.199" end="00:01:03.699" style="s2">of half ironically it would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.750" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">wonderful if there was a devil it would</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.699" end="00:01:07.479" style="s2">be wonderful if all of the evil and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:10.360" style="s2">suffering actually had you know an</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.479" end="00:01:13.090" style="s2">orchestrated genius behind it because</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.360" end="00:01:16.210" style="s2">then at last we could know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.090" end="00:01:18.040" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to do yeah very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:19.840" style="s2">we we&#39;ve turned it from an ill-defined</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.040" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">problem into a well-defined problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.840" end="00:01:23.650" style="s2">a hard problem but you know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:28.360" style="s2">not anymore it&#39;s not an ill-defined</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.650" end="00:01:33.130" style="s2">problem right so how do you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.360" end="00:01:37.000" style="s2">not in the Cabal yeah how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.130" end="00:01:38.380" style="s2">we go about as individuals navigate</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.000" end="00:01:41.530" style="s2">these child never getting these choppy</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">waters well I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.530" end="00:01:46.030" style="s2">wondering if that&#39;s one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">mean so a few minutes ago you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.030" end="00:01:51.130" style="s2">talking about a kind of wisdom we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:55.689" style="s2">in order to write sure we&#39;re going down</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.130" end="00:01:57.250" style="s2">the left-hand as you as you put it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.689" end="00:01:58.990" style="s2">suggesting to you that part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.250" end="00:02:02.890" style="s2">wisdom might be the kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.990" end="00:02:06.219" style="s2">knowledge of this modal kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.890" end="00:02:07.990" style="s2">deception and one of the so if I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.219" end="00:02:10.090" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing a lot of shifting of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.990" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">anxiety into fear that for me is a red</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.090" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">flag that forget what flag I love it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">a red flag that I&#39;m probably getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">into conspiratorial Kabbalistic gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">in the pejorative sense of the word kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">of thinking right yes absolutely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">really interesting I&#39;m loving the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:31.409" style="s2">inverse where the Black Plague broke the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:34.709" style="s2">religion that was a religion yep and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.409" end="00:02:36.900" style="s2">this this new thing is is what gives</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.709" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">rise to the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.900" end="00:02:41.879" style="s2">religion you just you just described one</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">you know one piece one one wouldn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.879" end="00:02:47.489" style="s2">is it a kailash homily no a reading</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:48.769" style="s2">right a reading a reading from the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.489" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">of the religion it&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.769" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">chemistry if you notice that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">shifting anxiety into fear then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">red flag yeah that&#39;s a red flag and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">the converse would be not just teaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:10.889" style="s2">people amelioration of anxiety that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">good you need something more like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.889" end="00:03:16.040" style="s2">we saw happen after the Black Plague</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">where we you again the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.040" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">identification of your interior life</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:21.629" style="s2">it&#39;s fun the grammar of that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">fundamentally changed it would have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.629" end="00:03:27.569" style="s2">be something more like in that there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">more deep so deeper into the guts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.569" end="00:03:33.180" style="s2">psyche the response to uncertainty and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:35.699" style="s2">dynamic change is something other than</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.180" end="00:03:38.299" style="s2">anxiety and we all but it has to be well</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.699" end="00:03:41.220" style="s2">no no we&#39;ve reconfigured the grammar</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.299" end="00:03:44.549" style="s2">before we have done this multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:46.199" style="s2">so so one is you know first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.549" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">perhaps a first step is while am i</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.199" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">translating anxiety into fear right well</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:54.120" style="s2">that&#39;s bad but another one is can I get</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:56.190" style="s2">deeper than the response of anxiety and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.120" end="00:03:58.500" style="s2">come up with something other than</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.190" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">anxiety as a response to uncertainty oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.500" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">it&#39;s so good isn&#39;t it I mean it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:02.489" style="s2">like this it&#39;s like it&#39;s like going</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:04.680" style="s2">through the looking glass because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.489" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">were talking about his faith a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.680" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">faith yes if aid from the we had talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:08.519" style="s2">about we&#39;ve talked about the several</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:11.010" style="s2">times we&#39;ve come to be the same place</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.519" end="00:04:13.049" style="s2">many times right yeah it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.010" end="00:04:14.849" style="s2">ideological it&#39;s not an irrational</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.049" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">commitment to an ideology it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.849" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">willful assertion of a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:23.789" style="s2">it&#39;s a cultivated sense of being uh like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">having a participatory conformity with</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.789" end="00:04:29.730" style="s2">an ongoing transformative process and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">it&#39;s continuity of contact rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.730" end="00:04:34.850" style="s2">closure into conclusion right boys</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a bunch of good words man so</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.850" end="00:04:38.490" style="s2">timestamp whatever this is right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">that was good that was it</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.490" end="00:04:42.389" style="s2">somebody write that down in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:44.850" style="s2">yeah the the visual image I have is of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.389" end="00:04:46.650" style="s2">like a buoy in the ocean that has you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:50.700" style="s2">know it just it&#39;s weighted such that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.650" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">even as the water I was having a sailing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.700" end="00:04:56.040" style="s2">imagery the person who can sort of can</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">ride the edge of the storm a family</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.040" end="00:05:00.150" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s you don&#39;t want to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:02.040" style="s2">swamped right that&#39;s the key yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.150" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">you know having a series of capacities</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.040" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">and abilities including the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">just sort of like surrender to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:10.650" style="s2">happening so that you&#39;re you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.970" style="s2">breaking as the system pushes on you but</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.650" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">you&#39;re actually able to just keep that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.970" end="00:05:18.090" style="s2">at all always stay in continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:19.320" style="s2">contact yeah always stay there because</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.090" end="00:05:20.430" style="s2">you know that if you&#39;re out of there</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.320" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">you&#39;re in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.430" end="00:05:25.350" style="s2">and if you&#39;re in there you can at least</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:27.030" style="s2">recover all right depending if the wave</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.350" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">if the winds died down a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.030" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">you&#39;re back into assailant yep yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:35.310" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the key yeah that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.410" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool there&#39;s a story by</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:41.430" style="s2">Joseph Conrad about a ship that gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.410" end="00:05:42.810" style="s2">swamped and that sailors are all stant</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.430" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">are sort of holding onto the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.810" end="00:05:47.940" style="s2">ship it&#39;s actually been swamped and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:49.620" style="s2">Alliston the captain he&#39;s just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.940" end="00:05:51.060" style="s2">all watching him good news they have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.620" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">they have a kind of they have a faith in</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.060" end="00:05:53.970" style="s2">him but he&#39;s watching and he&#39;s watching</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:55.530" style="s2">and he&#39;s watching and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.970" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">sudden goes okay now raise that sail</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.530" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">that sail that sail and then he goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:02.580" style="s2">right timing of wind and wave and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:04.500" style="s2">shipwrights there you go so he like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.580" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">he represents exactly that buoy right he</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.500" end="00:06:08.490" style="s2">was young he was aware that he even</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">being swamped is not being swamped yes</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.490" end="00:06:13.080" style="s2">yes yeah all in all it seemed like all</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:15.060" style="s2">was lost but as long as the captain has</p>
