<p begin="00:00:05.990" end="00:00:11.210" style="s2">the red pill was one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">polarizing documentaries of recent years</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.210" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">it showed self-described feminist cassie</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:20.850" style="s2">j going inside the men&#39;s rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">in the US where she changes her mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.850" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">about feminism the conversation is being</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:30.359" style="s2">silenced for a society to accept</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:33.390" style="s2">anything said on behalf of women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.359" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">rights and then to shame any dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.390" end="00:00:40.649" style="s2">about men&#39;s rights and call it hate</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">speech is precisely the problem I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.649" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">know where I&#39;m headed but I know what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">left behind I no longer call myself a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">feminist a word-of-mouth hit it also</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">provoked protests some extremely</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">critical reviews and was even banned</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:03.180" style="s2">from some cinemas in Australia so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">brought out the red pill is it two years</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.180" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">three years ago now yeah two tears and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">so there&#39;s one thing there&#39;s the film</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:12.030" style="s2">itself and I&#39;d love to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:13.049" style="s2">that and your journey about making it</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.030" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another thing which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.049" end="00:01:17.909" style="s2">the reaction to the film why I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">interested in that is that it shows a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.909" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">lot about the cultural moment that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">in when I watched the film as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">filmmaker I I had a slight suspicion or</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:32.700" style="s2">just I wondered like how authentic the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">journey was because it was very like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:37.560" style="s2">narrative was was sort of very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">you came in as a feminist and then work</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.560" end="00:01:41.759" style="s2">were sort of your mind was changed by</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">the stories that you heard and you came</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.759" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">out with a very different experience and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">I we interviewed Warren Farrell recently</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">in in America and I sort of said that to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">him I was like well you know Cassie and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:55.049" style="s2">how authentic was that journey and he</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">said no it&#39;s completely authentic and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.049" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">told me a little bit about the backstory</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">of what you were telling him as you were</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">going through it so I&#39;d love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:04.350" style="s2">more about that journey that you went</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">through him making it I appreciate you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.350" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">being honest that you&#39;re skeptical of is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">this girl for real was she really a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:11.490" style="s2">feminist and then sort of questioned her</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">beliefs after talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.490" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:17.610" style="s2">would have had the same reaction if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:19.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t make the red pill movie and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.610" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">watched it as a feminist I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">have been very skeptical well first of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">all I don&#39;t know if I would have watched</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">the red pill movie seeing how the media</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">was talking about the film but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">definitely would have been skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">because it is such a sensational idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">for a story for a documentary and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">almost too strange to be true but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:46.320" style="s2">it was actually kind of a suicide</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.360" style="s2">mission for me where I had a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:51.990" style="s2">hours of footage after filming men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.360" end="00:02:53.130" style="s2">rights activist for a year and but</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.990" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">working on the film for three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.130" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">years and I I knew the journey that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">went on was going to make me extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">vulnerable and open to critique and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:09.630" style="s2">debate and and probably a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:14.520" style="s2">would question you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.630" end="00:03:16.710" style="s2">Who am I and am I true and in my video</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.520" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">diaries and and my interviews and all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.710" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">that and even men&#39;s rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:22.140" style="s2">were questioning me as a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">filmmaker going in to interview them so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.140" end="00:03:29.010" style="s2">really everyone was wondering is this</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:31.490" style="s2">chick for real so yeah I knew in making</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.010" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">the film there was gonna be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.490" end="00:03:36.450" style="s2">skepticism about me and I I just figured</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:39.270" style="s2">while I have to put it out there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.450" end="00:03:40.710" style="s2">whatever happens happens and I I say it</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.270" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">was a suicide mission because if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.710" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">completely flopped and failed knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:49.230" style="s2">that I put the raw real journey out</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:51.240" style="s2">there then as well as having this stigma</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.230" end="00:03:53.610" style="s2">now against my name being a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.240" end="00:03:56.220" style="s2">highly controversial topic for a film I</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.610" end="00:03:58.770" style="s2">would have to go into hiding in it and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.220" end="00:04:01.530" style="s2">resolved that in my head as well I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.770" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">just become a mother I&#39;m already a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.530" end="00:04:07.850" style="s2">hermit anyways I&#39;m I&#39;m a homebody so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:11.670" style="s2">was willing to take that risk and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.850" end="00:04:13.440" style="s2">luckily the film really resonated with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.670" end="00:04:15.600" style="s2">lot of people around the world so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.440" end="00:04:18.330" style="s2">I&#39;m glad I took that risk could you</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.600" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">describe that journey and what you went</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.330" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">through what were your intentions going</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:24.870" style="s2">into it what happened during it and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:27.630" style="s2">where did you end up</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.870" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">well my attentions going into it were I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.630" end="00:04:32.400" style="s2">mean it talks a little bit about it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:35.670" style="s2">the film I was looking into the rape</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.400" end="00:04:38.010" style="s2">culture topic for a documentary and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.670" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">really made me decide not to do a film</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.010" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">about that was because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:43.140" style="s2">depressing when I started looking into</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">the stories that I could cover and I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:49.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t know if I could put years of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">mental headspace into that topic by when</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.200" end="00:04:54.150" style="s2">when I was trying to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:56.580" style="s2">cause of the feminist view of rape</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.150" end="00:04:59.190" style="s2">culture I was pointed towards the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.580" end="00:05:01.740" style="s2">rights movement and at the time a voice</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.190" end="00:05:03.660" style="s2">for men this online hub of men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.740" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">activists was the largest and fasting</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.660" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">fastest growing men&#39;s rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:10.860" style="s2">online and they were definitely the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">controversial with Polly Elam being The</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.860" end="00:05:17.780" style="s2">provocateur of the movement and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:19.770" style="s2">thought well this is interesting and I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.780" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">researched and found that no one had</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.770" end="00:05:23.400" style="s2">ever made a film on men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.950" style="s2">movement before it was fairly a young</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.400" end="00:05:28.370" style="s2">movement still so I thought I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.950" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">be the first and it was going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.370" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">shocking piece and it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">feminist going undercover into this</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:39.240" style="s2">misogynistic world and I would expose</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:41.280" style="s2">them for who they really are and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.240" end="00:05:45.240" style="s2">really that&#39;s what I thought the film</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:46.500" style="s2">was going to become and sure enough as I</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.240" end="00:05:50.190" style="s2">started interviewing men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.500" end="00:05:52.770" style="s2">activists I knew that that idea that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.190" end="00:05:54.510" style="s2">had of men&#39;s rights activist was not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.770" end="00:05:55.980" style="s2">truth of who they really were and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.510" end="00:05:58.110" style="s2">they cared about or why they were part</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.980" end="00:06:01.320" style="s2">of the men&#39;s rights movement and so then</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.110" end="00:06:03.300" style="s2">I had to put my own agenda aside and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.320" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">really start to listen to what they had</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.300" end="00:06:06.990" style="s2">to say and why they care about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">movement and and ask myself is there</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.990" end="00:06:11.610" style="s2">still a story here and there were</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:13.290" style="s2">definitely moments while I was filming</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.610" end="00:06:15.210" style="s2">and editing I was wondering well who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.290" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">gonna care about you know father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.210" end="00:06:19.290" style="s2">rights and suicide rates and male</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">victims of domestic violence do we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.290" end="00:06:23.490" style="s2">really have of all the issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:24.810" style="s2">world is this worth someone&#39;s two hours</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.490" end="00:06:27.930" style="s2">of their time to watch the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.810" end="00:06:29.190" style="s2">and the more I really started to dig</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.930" end="00:06:32.610" style="s2">into it I realized</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.190" end="00:06:36.030" style="s2">is a huge pervasive issue all throughout</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.610" end="00:06:38.430" style="s2">the world with gender relations and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.030" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">what&#39;s happening for men opting out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.430" end="00:06:45.090" style="s2">marriage and you know the MiG town</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:49.860" style="s2">movement and feminism kind of dominating</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.090" end="00:06:52.200" style="s2">the the pop culture and the media and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.860" end="00:06:54.570" style="s2">obviously I began to see that with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.200" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">release of the film so I didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.570" end="00:07:00.270" style="s2">quite the extent until the film was</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:01.980" style="s2">released how much the average person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.270" end="00:07:05.810" style="s2">view of gender politics is really the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.980" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">the feminist ideology of gender politics</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:15.270" style="s2">so I and I think what really intrigued</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:15.780" style="s2">me was how when I started to realize how</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.270" end="00:07:18.600" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.780" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">I was against men&#39;s issues and my</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.600" end="00:07:24.420" style="s2">knee-jerk reaction to wanting to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:26.250" style="s2">them or victim blame male victims of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.420" end="00:07:28.320" style="s2">domestic violence for instance I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.250" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">I realized that wow this is a lot deeper</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.320" end="00:07:32.910" style="s2">than that I thought I really do</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">appreciate that you told me that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.910" end="00:07:37.410" style="s2">skeptical of my journey making the film</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:42.270" style="s2">and whether or not it was a scripted</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.410" end="00:07:43.919" style="s2">plan for sensationalism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.270" end="00:07:45.120" style="s2">even if I never made the red pill movie</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.919" end="00:07:47.010" style="s2">and I just went on the journey of</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.120" end="00:07:49.460" style="s2">filming all these men&#39;s rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.010" end="00:07:52.020" style="s2">and questioning my own beliefs I I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.460" end="00:07:54.210" style="s2">really do believe that I benefited from</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.020" end="00:07:57.180" style="s2">going going on that journey especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.210" end="00:08:00.090" style="s2">in my own relationship and also</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.180" end="00:08:03.510" style="s2">understanding my father figures and male</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.090" end="00:08:06.330" style="s2">friends better I think I could have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.510" end="00:08:08.010" style="s2">more private about my evolved views and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.330" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">maybe that would have saved me some</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.010" end="00:08:13.730" style="s2">stress over the past few years but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:16.980" style="s2">because I chose to take my</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.730" end="00:08:21.210" style="s2">transformation public and show it and in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.980" end="00:08:24.750" style="s2">this film it really kind of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:27.980" style="s2">guess I asked to be on the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.750" end="00:08:33.420" style="s2">stones to be thrown and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.980" end="00:08:36.030" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that I did it I hope I know</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.420" end="00:08:40.740" style="s2">that it helps a lot of people making</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.030" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">this film and and but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.740" end="00:08:45.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere near where</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">we need to be and I think the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.210" end="00:08:49.650" style="s2">movie was just a very early kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:51.480" style="s2">icebreaker into these conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.650" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">I think we have a long way to go with</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.480" end="00:08:56.970" style="s2">gender relations and and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">eventually finding a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.970" end="00:09:01.410" style="s2">relationship between the genders but</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:03.800" style="s2">mostly for children a lot of men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.410" end="00:09:07.740" style="s2">rights activists I&#39;m hearing are</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.800" end="00:09:09.900" style="s2">becoming very anti marriage and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.740" end="00:09:11.970" style="s2">in the sense that McDowell is men going</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.900" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">their own way our anti marriage a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.970" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists are also moving</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:18.600" style="s2">in that direction because they believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:20.550" style="s2">the institution of marriage is so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.600" end="00:09:22.140" style="s2">corrupt and divorce courts are so</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.550" end="00:09:27.210" style="s2">corrupt that they don&#39;t want to engage</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.140" end="00:09:33.630" style="s2">in all in it at all and the the danger</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.210" end="00:09:36.870" style="s2">and that is children because I I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.630" end="00:09:38.910" style="s2">we&#39;re men&#39;s rights activists don&#39;t are</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.870" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">contradictory in their views as if</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.910" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">they&#39;re anti marriage but they also</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:47.820" style="s2">stress the importance of present father</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:49.380" style="s2">figures father to child connection you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.820" end="00:09:51.780" style="s2">need marriage to strengthen that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.380" end="00:09:54.540" style="s2">relationship and men&#39;s rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.780" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">have done a lot of work and even non</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.540" end="00:09:57.120" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists have done a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.330" style="s2">of work in showing the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.120" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">present father figures and the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.330" end="00:10:11.310" style="s2">single mothers and I I would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:13.770" style="s2">marriage valued and and looked at from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.310" end="00:10:15.720" style="s2">scientific standpoint of building a</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.770" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">healthy society rather than from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.720" end="00:10:22.290" style="s2">religious origin because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:26.340" style="s2">religious and I wouldn&#39;t even call</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.290" end="00:10:29.970" style="s2">myself a traditionalist but I do think</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.340" end="00:10:33.480" style="s2">marriage is a very important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.970" end="00:10:37.680" style="s2">backbone of our society for children so</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.480" end="00:10:39.089" style="s2">I think we need a look in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.680" end="00:10:41.520" style="s2">helped to move in it in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.089" end="00:10:44.390" style="s2">you kind of had your focus on gender</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.520" end="00:10:48.120" style="s2">issues just before the me to movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.390" end="00:10:50.220" style="s2">started but in a way you took precisely</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.120" end="00:10:53.330" style="s2">the opposite perspective to to where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.220" end="00:10:54.779" style="s2">culture was going and I say yes I did</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.330" end="00:10:58.950" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.779" end="00:11:01.140" style="s2">the me to movement really got traction a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.950" end="00:11:03.839" style="s2">few months after the film&#39;s release so</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.140" end="00:11:07.830" style="s2">there was no way I could know that that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.839" end="00:11:10.920" style="s2">was going to be the parallel media story</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.830" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">along with the red pills release so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.920" end="00:11:14.940" style="s2">was interesting and I would have loved</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">to have commented on that movement if I</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.940" end="00:11:20.040" style="s2">knew that was going to be coming your</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:21.450" style="s2">background I mean we talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.040" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">before the cameras were rolling and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.450" end="00:11:25.140" style="s2">described herself as you live in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.010" end="00:11:27.000" style="s2">California you&#39;re you&#39;re a liberal I</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.140" end="00:11:28.680" style="s2">mean can you sort of sketch out where</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.000" end="00:11:30.990" style="s2">you&#39;re from and and and what your</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.680" end="00:11:32.970" style="s2">personal sort of background is sure oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.990" end="00:11:35.880" style="s2">well I live in the San Francisco Bay</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.970" end="00:11:39.480" style="s2">Area sorry I live in the San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.880" end="00:11:41.370" style="s2">Bay Area and I grew up in Seattle I went</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.480" end="00:11:43.890" style="s2">to high school in Las Vegas I lived in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.370" end="00:11:45.480" style="s2">Los Angeles for about five years in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.890" end="00:11:47.370" style="s2">film industry pursuing acting at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.480" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">time I never really made it I was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.370" end="00:11:53.790" style="s2">horrible actress but I did a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">horror films in LA before moving up to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.790" end="00:12:03.630" style="s2">the Bay Area to continue documentary</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:07.020" style="s2">filmmaking and I grew up fairly radical</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.630" end="00:12:11.580" style="s2">image a local Christian and now I</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.020" end="00:12:15.270" style="s2">consider myself agnostic but I left the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.580" end="00:12:18.779" style="s2">church around my late teens around 20</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.270" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">and around that time as I was leaving</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.779" end="00:12:22.709" style="s2">the church I was also becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">feminist and and that was when social</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.709" end="00:12:28.970" style="s2">media was kind of really taking off</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:30.889" style="s2">around 2000 5 6 7</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.970" end="00:12:34.339" style="s2">and I think social media had a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.889" end="00:12:37.639" style="s2">with me becoming a feminist just seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.339" end="00:12:40.310" style="s2">those little info memes and getting</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.639" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">sound bites of you know the pay gap</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.310" end="00:12:47.180" style="s2">which at the time I was eating up and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:50.689" style="s2">believing and so I became an online</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.180" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">feminist and and for about ten years I</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.689" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">was a feminist before I started making</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:56.269" style="s2">the red pill movie and you at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">the film you say you no longer consider</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.269" end="00:13:01.990" style="s2">yourself a feminist how what what did he</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:07.670" style="s2">mean by that and how would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.990" end="00:13:08.810" style="s2">what it means to say that well that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.670" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">was definitely one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.810" end="00:13:14.750" style="s2">question marks in my whole journey</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.430" style="s2">making the film was do I keep the label</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.750" end="00:13:18.470" style="s2">feminists and try to work within the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.430" end="00:13:21.319" style="s2">movement to make it more inclusive of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.470" end="00:13:23.230" style="s2">men&#39;s issues because after learning</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.319" end="00:13:25.459" style="s2">about all these issues there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.230" end="00:13:28.310" style="s2">then walk through the world ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.459" end="00:13:29.839" style="s2">that they exist I mean making the film</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.310" end="00:13:31.639" style="s2">and probably for viewers watching the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.839" end="00:13:35.000" style="s2">film you can never see the world the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.639" end="00:13:37.579" style="s2">same way again so I thought do I keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.000" end="00:13:39.019" style="s2">the title or the label feminist to try</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.579" end="00:13:40.670" style="s2">to work within the movement kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.019" end="00:13:43.069" style="s2">a christina hoff sommers the factual</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.670" end="00:13:44.990" style="s2">feminist and of course you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.069" end="00:13:47.329" style="s2">seen with her that it doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.990" end="00:13:49.430" style="s2">she calls herself a feminist the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.329" end="00:13:52.519" style="s2">mainstream press will say what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.430" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">wanted her and feminists will disown her</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">I&#39;m just one person in my late 20s at</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.990" end="00:14:05.180" style="s2">the time I don&#39;t think I have the power</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.540" end="00:14:16.269" style="s2">decided to drop the label feminist I</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.269" end="00:14:24.529" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good question why I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.730" end="00:14:27.559" style="s2">I think I also I think I wanted to see</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.529" end="00:14:29.209" style="s2">how people would react I live in the Bay</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.209" end="00:14:35.209" style="s2">consider themselves feminists and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.189" end="00:14:36.769" style="s2">kind of a a given I mean the the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.209" end="00:14:39.380" style="s2">that if you&#39;re for gender equality then</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.769" end="00:14:42.080" style="s2">you&#39;re a feminist and it&#39;s you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.380" end="00:14:44.210" style="s2">have one without the other and</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.080" end="00:14:46.610" style="s2">so that I knew that their labeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.210" end="00:14:49.180" style="s2">themselves feminists based on you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.610" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">what they&#39;re reading and mostly liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.180" end="00:14:54.950" style="s2">publications and and so I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:56.360" style="s2">if I make the red pill movie and I share</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.950" end="00:14:58.100" style="s2">with them because really in a one dinner</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.360" end="00:15:00.260" style="s2">conversation I cannot explain to them</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.100" end="00:15:02.120" style="s2">the journey I went on so hopefully I can</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.260" end="00:15:04.910" style="s2">make a film to at least be an icebreaker</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.120" end="00:15:07.150" style="s2">to these conversations and it did open a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.910" end="00:15:09.920" style="s2">lot of their eyes and minds to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.150" end="00:15:12.970" style="s2">considering men&#39;s issues but still many</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.920" end="00:15:15.830" style="s2">of them remained feminists identifying</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.970" end="00:15:18.050" style="s2">but some of them have gone on their own</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.830" end="00:15:21.110" style="s2">kind of rabbit little journey after</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.050" end="00:15:23.840" style="s2">watching the film and and started to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.110" end="00:15:26.860" style="s2">some of the male bashing by feminist</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.840" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">scholars or educators or the media and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.860" end="00:15:30.980" style="s2">started to question well is feminism</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:34.370" style="s2">really the movement the one and only</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.980" end="00:15:36.290" style="s2">movement for gender equality and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.370" end="00:15:37.550" style="s2">know personally for me I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.290" end="00:15:40.030" style="s2">be a part of a movement for gender</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.550" end="00:15:43.910" style="s2">equality that includes men and boys in</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.030" end="00:15:45.650" style="s2">in the discussion and I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.910" end="00:15:50.300" style="s2">step is to raising awareness about these</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.650" end="00:15:52.520" style="s2">issues which feminism is not doing so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.300" end="00:15:56.440" style="s2">dropped the label feminists I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.520" end="00:15:59.300" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists at all I</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.440" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">understand their movement and sympathize</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.300" end="00:16:05.690" style="s2">with their cause I think what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:08.050" style="s2">doing is valuable today I don&#39;t know I I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.690" end="00:16:11.390" style="s2">hope it won&#39;t be necessary</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.050" end="00:16:13.070" style="s2">15 20 50 years from now but right now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.390" end="00:16:15.290" style="s2">think it is necessary to have this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.070" end="00:16:18.620" style="s2">counterbalance in the gender political</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.290" end="00:16:22.370" style="s2">discussion but I&#39;m not a men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.620" end="00:16:24.050" style="s2">activist and what was the reaction among</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.370" end="00:16:26.270" style="s2">your friends and kind of your immediate</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.050" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">circle did you have any pushback or did</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.270" end="00:16:31.910" style="s2">he lose any friends I lost some friends</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.100" end="00:16:34.070" style="s2">and in a fade out kind of way where they</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.910" end="00:16:36.710" style="s2">they heard about the red pill or they</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.070" end="00:16:38.930" style="s2">saw many imprinted and didn&#39;t like what</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.710" end="00:16:42.380" style="s2">they read and thought that I&#39;d become</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.930" end="00:16:43.790" style="s2">some crazy right winger or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.380" end="00:16:46.280" style="s2">which I&#39;m not I&#39;m still a registered</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.790" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">Democrat and and I can it hurt myself a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.280" end="00:16:53.150" style="s2">liberal but I&#39;ve been printed alongside</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:57.110" style="s2">its white supremacist nationalists and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.150" end="00:16:58.850" style="s2">you know if I read that about some one</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.110" end="00:17:00.080" style="s2">of my friends a few years ago back when</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.850" end="00:17:02.570" style="s2">I was a feminist I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.080" end="00:17:04.430" style="s2">alarmed too and thought well someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.570" end="00:17:06.230" style="s2">went off the deep end went crazy you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.430" end="00:17:08.420" style="s2">know put him in a padded room and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.230" end="00:17:10.580" style="s2">think that&#39;s what many of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.420" end="00:17:12.950" style="s2">thought happened to me when we spoke to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.580" end="00:17:15.470" style="s2">Warren Farrell in America recently he</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.950" end="00:17:17.570" style="s2">said that you came to him and said oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.470" end="00:17:20.660" style="s2">are people gonna turn against me and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.570" end="00:17:22.250" style="s2">said yes they are and at the time you</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.660" end="00:17:23.660" style="s2">were like I was looking for some</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.250" end="00:17:26.510" style="s2">reassurance and you&#39;re you&#39;re not giving</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.660" end="00:17:28.370" style="s2">it to me yeah I mean a lot of the men so</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.510" end="00:17:30.200" style="s2">it&#39;s activists and I don&#39;t think Warren</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.370" end="00:17:32.270" style="s2">Federal Ferrell considers himself a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.200" end="00:17:34.010" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists but but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.270" end="00:17:36.920" style="s2">the people I talk to during making the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.010" end="00:17:39.410" style="s2">red pill movie did warn me that I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.920" end="00:17:42.860" style="s2">be career suicide that I would lose</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.410" end="00:17:44.330" style="s2">friends and colleagues and and at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.860" end="00:17:48.260" style="s2">time I thought they were being overly</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.330" end="00:17:51.620" style="s2">dramatic and I I just thought the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.260" end="00:17:54.440" style="s2">movement was had all these conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.620" end="00:17:56.780" style="s2">that were unrealistic and maybe wanting</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.440" end="00:17:59.690" style="s2">to you know get thing on their movement</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.780" end="00:18:00.890" style="s2">riled up to excite people or feel like</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.690" end="00:18:05.030" style="s2">they were part of some underground</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.890" end="00:18:06.440" style="s2">secret society and so I really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.030" end="00:18:09.710" style="s2">brushed it off and didn&#39;t think much of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.440" end="00:18:11.210" style="s2">it but sure enough years later a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.710" end="00:18:13.250" style="s2">their premonitions were correct</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.210" end="00:18:15.800" style="s2">what what do you make of the media</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.250" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">response because I sort of looked online</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.800" end="00:18:20.590" style="s2">and quite a few that there&#39;s some really</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:22.430" style="s2">harsh criticisms of the film sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.590" end="00:18:25.400" style="s2">especially from some of those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.430" end="00:18:28.940" style="s2">more maybe millennial outfits like Vox</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.400" end="00:18:31.220" style="s2">and Vice and all of those people that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.940" end="00:18:37.180" style="s2">maybe put some quotes and on-screen here</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.220" end="00:18:40.790" style="s2">but what did he make of that response I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.180" end="00:18:45.170" style="s2">mean it was really hard at the time you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.790" end="00:18:47.300" style="s2">know I&#39;m I take a lot of things you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.170" end="00:18:49.670" style="s2">personally I&#39;m a fairly sensitive person</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.300" end="00:18:52.490" style="s2">and you know emotional at times and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.670" end="00:18:55.100" style="s2">whenever an article is published that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.490" end="00:18:58.510" style="s2">scathing of me or the film based on</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.100" end="00:19:01.160" style="s2">misinformation it&#39;s infuriating to me</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.510" end="00:19:02.860" style="s2">because I it&#39;s obvious they didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.160" end="00:19:07.559" style="s2">their due diligence as</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.860" end="00:19:11.410" style="s2">us to really research and and I know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.559" end="00:19:13.090" style="s2">how the snowball started and and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.410" end="00:19:15.190" style="s2">saw it rolling down the hill and it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.090" end="00:19:16.690" style="s2">started with our very first review of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.190" end="00:19:21.429" style="s2">the red pill movie in the Village Voice</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.690" end="00:19:23.290" style="s2">based on radical feminist bloggers blog</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.429" end="00:19:25.150" style="s2">and the misinformation he posted about</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.290" end="00:19:28.120" style="s2">me and the men&#39;s rights movement and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.150" end="00:19:30.790" style="s2">that is what had everything spiral out</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.120" end="00:19:33.070" style="s2">of control and how the the red pill was</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.790" end="00:19:35.290" style="s2">publicized and all the petitions against</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.070" end="00:19:37.270" style="s2">the film and the justifications for</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.290" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">banning the film in Australia and Canada</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.270" end="00:19:44.910" style="s2">were all based on these lies and it just</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:50.410" style="s2">made me lose a lot of faith in the media</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.910" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">and also you know social media and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.410" end="00:20:02.410" style="s2">power and and danger of groupthink and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:04.030" style="s2">thought police and and I and I also</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.410" end="00:20:07.630" style="s2">acknowledged that I used to be a part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.030" end="00:20:09.130" style="s2">that and how easily I could have fallen</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.630" end="00:20:11.380" style="s2">into that had I never made this film</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.130" end="00:20:12.700" style="s2">myself and I don&#39;t know if anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.380" end="00:20:14.740" style="s2">would have made the film I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.700" end="00:20:16.390" style="s2">think someone out there is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.740" end="00:20:18.070" style="s2">making more films about these topics</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.390" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">because I think they need to be talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.070" end="00:20:22.270" style="s2">about but if I never made the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.520" style="s2">movie I would have been right alongside</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.270" end="00:20:28.600" style="s2">those other feminists trying to ban this</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.520" end="00:20:30.160" style="s2">film and based on misinformation whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.600" end="00:20:34.870" style="s2">any of the criticisms of the film that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.160" end="00:20:37.110" style="s2">you think were justified hmm that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.870" end="00:20:40.090" style="s2">very good question</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.110" end="00:20:42.429" style="s2">of course the you know my argument is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.090" end="00:20:44.200" style="s2">time constraints is very you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.429" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">there&#39;s only so much you can do with</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.200" end="00:20:47.650" style="s2">what I was aiming for hour and a half</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:48.850" style="s2">long film became 2 hours so I was</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.650" end="00:20:50.770" style="s2">already stretching it kind of long but</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.850" end="00:20:53.770" style="s2">there&#39;s never enough time to include</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.770" end="00:20:57.720" style="s2">everything and and one of I think one</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.770" end="00:21:02.049" style="s2">criticism that I would give credit to is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.720" end="00:21:06.100" style="s2">how the red pill movie portrays feminism</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.049" end="00:21:09.419" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t a you know malicious</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.100" end="00:21:12.040" style="s2">intentional effort to you know make</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.419" end="00:21:15.330" style="s2">feminism look any kind of way I actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.040" end="00:21:17.460" style="s2">think I have far more rational and level</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.330" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">had a feminist but most people going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.460" end="00:21:20.940" style="s2">the movie theater to watch the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:22.980" style="s2">only remember big red with the bright</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.940" end="00:21:24.960" style="s2">red hair and so they think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.980" end="00:21:30.300" style="s2">only discussion of feminism is her as</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.960" end="00:21:32.430" style="s2">the as the the front of the movement and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.300" end="00:21:34.410" style="s2">I didn&#39;t see it that way I think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.430" end="00:21:36.990" style="s2">just very memorable but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.410" end="00:21:38.070" style="s2">that&#39;s the you know of all the content</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.990" end="00:21:40.560" style="s2">included in the film there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.070" end="00:21:42.330" style="s2">other scholars that are feminists that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.560" end="00:21:44.460" style="s2">talk about their views on the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.330" end="00:21:46.470" style="s2">rights movement and feminism but I also</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.460" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t see the need to have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.470" end="00:21:50.610" style="s2">history lesson on feminism because there</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:53.550" style="s2">are for my one red pill movie</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.610" end="00:21:55.410" style="s2">documentary there&#39;s a thousand or more</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.550" end="00:21:58.440" style="s2">feminist documentaries that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.410" end="00:22:01.170" style="s2">watch on the same online platforms so to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.440" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">take up - to take up time from the one</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.170" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">and only documentary on the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:08.310" style="s2">movement to date to take time out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:11.940" style="s2">that to discuss the history of feminism</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.310" end="00:22:14.490" style="s2">I I think would have been stolen time so</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.940" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">the criticism was that it was a</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.490" end="00:22:18.390" style="s2">caricature of feminism because it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:21.540" style="s2">mainly through this character at big red</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.390" end="00:22:24.920" style="s2">is that yeah there was criticism that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.540" end="00:22:28.470" style="s2">feminism moment wasn&#39;t portrayed in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.920" end="00:22:30.300" style="s2">positive light that that more</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.470" end="00:22:33.270" style="s2">level-headed feminists would have liked</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.300" end="00:22:35.340" style="s2">to see but you know we did have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.270" end="00:22:37.620" style="s2">executive editor of news magazine who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.340" end="00:22:40.460" style="s2">certainly very powerful in there and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.620" end="00:22:43.410" style="s2">feminist majority foundation and and in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.460" end="00:22:45.390" style="s2">universities nationwide Michael Kimmel</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.410" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">is very influential feminist author</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.390" end="00:22:53.820" style="s2">Michael Messner is a gender studies</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:56.270" style="s2">professor i USC and you know I had</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:22:58.890" style="s2">feminist friends included in the film so</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.270" end="00:23:00.150" style="s2">protesters as well of course the big red</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.890" end="00:23:01.980" style="s2">hat to be in there because she was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.150" end="00:23:04.410" style="s2">only feminist that had a run-in with</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.980" end="00:23:07.020" style="s2">men&#39;s rights activists face to face and</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.410" end="00:23:08.910" style="s2">so it was a kind of a historical</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.020" end="00:23:11.070" style="s2">milestone for the men&#39;s rights movement</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.910" end="00:23:12.630" style="s2">to have this one and only interaction</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.070" end="00:23:14.610" style="s2">between feminists and men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.630" end="00:23:16.860" style="s2">activists at an event so I had to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:19.770" style="s2">included and I was lucky enough to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.860" end="00:23:22.020" style="s2">an interview with her so you know I also</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.770" end="00:23:26.130" style="s2">got criticism for including Paul Elam in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.020" end="00:23:29.090" style="s2">the film which if I didn&#39;t include Paul</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.130" end="00:23:31.730" style="s2">Elam in the film I would see that as a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:33.470" style="s2">Aled criticism because he&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.730" end="00:23:36.530" style="s2">known men&#39;s rights activists at least at</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.470" end="00:23:38.570" style="s2">the time when I was filming and why</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.530" end="00:23:44.020" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you go to the source of all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.570" end="00:23:46.310" style="s2">controversy and so there there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.020" end="00:23:49.070" style="s2">student groups who have screened the red</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.310" end="00:23:52.760" style="s2">pill movie and then have been banned</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.070" end="00:23:54.800" style="s2">from pride parades and participating and</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.760" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">other events just because they screen</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.800" end="00:23:59.510" style="s2">the red pill movie which had Paul Elam</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.160" style="s2">in it so it wasn&#39;t the movie itself that</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.510" end="00:24:03.590" style="s2">was the problem but the fact that Paul</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.160" end="00:24:05.450" style="s2">Elam was in the film was the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.590" end="00:24:09.650" style="s2">there&#39;s just no way to win is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.450" end="00:24:12.350" style="s2">on you know I maybe eventually there</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.650" end="00:24:14.450" style="s2">will be a sequel who knows or another</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.350" end="00:24:16.070" style="s2">filmmaker I hope will be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.450" end="00:24:17.690" style="s2">tackling the men&#39;s rights movement and</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.070" end="00:24:21.710" style="s2">they can do their own treatment of how</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.690" end="00:24:25.220" style="s2">they lay the issues out there or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.710" end="00:24:26.870" style="s2">members but you know it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.220" end="00:24:28.610" style="s2">critique films though because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.870" end="00:24:32.090" style="s2">that&#39;s what you wanted as a filmmaker is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.610" end="00:24:33.920" style="s2">conversation do you think with with</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">Pauly Lam you could have been a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.920" end="00:24:39.860" style="s2">bit more hard on him I mean my sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:41.480" style="s2">watching the film was that as you just</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.860" end="00:24:45.020" style="s2">said before you&#39;re not really a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.480" end="00:24:48.290" style="s2">confrontational kind of person and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.020" end="00:24:50.420" style="s2">journalist so I&#39;m kind of used to kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.290" end="00:24:51.950" style="s2">of confrontational style of interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.420" end="00:24:56.450" style="s2">not that I particularly enjoy doing it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.950" end="00:24:58.250" style="s2">that way myself but like I did come away</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.450" end="00:25:01.010" style="s2">thinking you didn&#39;t maybe ask some hard</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.250" end="00:25:02.330" style="s2">questions - Pauly Lam but it that but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.010" end="00:25:04.280" style="s2">got the sense that was your interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.330" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">style you didn&#39;t really ask but you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.280" end="00:25:09.470" style="s2">didn&#39;t really put anyone on the spot on</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:11.870" style="s2">either side and I but I guess that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.470" end="00:25:13.190" style="s2">and I know now that you weren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.870" end="00:25:14.210" style="s2">sure like why you were gathering the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.190" end="00:25:15.260" style="s2">interview you haven&#39;t really made up</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.210" end="00:25:17.000" style="s2">your mind about what you thought about</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.260" end="00:25:19.730" style="s2">any of them you were still in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.000" end="00:25:21.860" style="s2">process well I think it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.730" end="00:25:25.790" style="s2">distinguish between a Barbara Walters</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.860" end="00:25:27.320" style="s2">type interview and a documentary and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.790" end="00:25:29.690" style="s2">history and documentary filmmaking has</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.320" end="00:25:32.120" style="s2">actually been flying the wall and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.690" end="00:25:34.850" style="s2">rarely if ever my my voice has ever</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.120" end="00:25:37.490" style="s2">heard in the film so the red pill was</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.850" end="00:25:40.700" style="s2">the first film I ever included myself in</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.490" end="00:25:42.760" style="s2">the film at all in including as</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.700" end="00:25:46.460" style="s2">narrator and also asking a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.760" end="00:25:48.380" style="s2">but very few questions that I asked my</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.460" end="00:25:51.080" style="s2">interview subjects were included in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.380" end="00:25:52.370" style="s2">final film itself so for people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.080" end="00:25:55.070" style="s2">criticize that I didn&#39;t ask</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.370" end="00:25:59.960" style="s2">harder-hitting questions to Paul Elam or</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.070" end="00:26:02.060" style="s2">to feminists or to big red eyed you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.960" end="00:26:05.330" style="s2">all the questions that I did ask them in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.060" end="00:26:07.730" style="s2">my two to five hour long interviews work</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.330" end="00:26:10.510" style="s2">cut out except for maybe one question so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.730" end="00:26:13.430" style="s2">to criticize the questions I asked is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.510" end="00:26:17.180" style="s2">you know a hundred questions I asked</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.430" end="00:26:18.890" style="s2">them ones shown in the film I think you</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.180" end="00:26:21.010" style="s2">have to acknowledge the format of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.890" end="00:26:26.690" style="s2">documentary especially when it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.010" end="00:26:28.520" style="s2">fly-on-the-wall but you know it&#39;s I did</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.690" end="00:26:30.020" style="s2">release a lot of the raw footage of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.520" end="00:26:32.000" style="s2">red pill movie so I really stood on</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.020" end="00:26:34.220" style="s2">YouTube for free for people to watch to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.000" end="00:26:36.710" style="s2">see if I edit in anything out of context</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.220" end="00:26:40.430" style="s2">or try to manipulate the way someone was</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.710" end="00:26:43.220" style="s2">portrayed and I think that really helped</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.430" end="00:26:46.970" style="s2">in showing that I did not have creative</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.220" end="00:26:48.650" style="s2">manipulation in my editing style so if</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.970" end="00:26:50.180" style="s2">anyone is wondering if I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.650" end="00:26:51.830" style="s2">hard-hitting enough to appalled a limb</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.180" end="00:26:56.390" style="s2">or anyone else they can watch the raw</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.830" end="00:26:59.240" style="s2">files so yeah but as far as being more</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.390" end="00:27:00.980" style="s2">confrontational I think I was really</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.240" end="00:27:02.870" style="s2">confrontational in the raw files that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.980" end="00:27:06.290" style="s2">just a matter of if it made it into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.870" end="00:27:07.970" style="s2">final film because of all the that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.290" end="00:27:09.530" style="s2">people in the film the one that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:11.360" style="s2">people do keep coming back to his Paul</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.530" end="00:27:13.760" style="s2">Elin and there are some things that he</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.360" end="00:27:15.110" style="s2">said like I find really difficult online</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.760" end="00:27:18.470" style="s2">like I&#39;ve got a lot of sympathy with</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.110" end="00:27:20.270" style="s2">with with the men&#39;s rights perspective</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.470" end="00:27:23.000" style="s2">that it is something that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.270" end="00:27:24.380" style="s2">seen or part of the conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.000" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">when I see him saying things like I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.380" end="00:27:28.130" style="s2">would definitely let off and I would</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:31.190" style="s2">never find someone guilty in a rape</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.130" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">trial for example I just think this is</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.500" end="00:27:56.530" style="s2">people are really interested although I</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.150" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">think that people who need to hear it</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.760" end="00:28:23.890" style="s2">and I do recommend anyone who you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.120" end="00:28:27.100" style="s2">thinks that&#39;s a horrible comment read</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.320" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">criticisms of well what about when</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.930" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2">Gloria Steinem said this in 1995 or what</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:29:00.010" style="s2">about when Hillary Clinton said this in</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:29:05.170" style="s2">1992 you know that the media doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.010" end="00:29:08.380" style="s2">take the same kind of just what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.380" end="00:29:18.460" style="s2">that they&#39;ve said that could be taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.970" end="00:29:21.280" style="s2">offensively and asking the filmmaker why</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.460" end="00:29:23.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t you say when Hillary Clinton said</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.280" end="00:29:25.750" style="s2">that the biggest victims of war are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.590" end="00:29:29.910" style="s2">women and children who lose their</p>

<p begin="00:29:29.910" end="00:29:34.120" style="s2">does sound like a horrible soundbite and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.770" end="00:29:37.330" style="s2">maybe that should be looked at in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.120" end="00:29:39.640" style="s2">feminist documentaries so you know and</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.330" end="00:29:41.500" style="s2">then the the fish in bicycle comment by</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.640" end="00:29:45.370" style="s2">Gloria Steinem was quoting someone else</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.500" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">but she repeated it so you know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.370" end="00:29:50.410" style="s2">there was a hashtag kill all men on</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:52.060" style="s2">Twitter that was going around and being</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.410" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">supported by feminist scholars and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.060" end="00:29:57.450" style="s2">universities you know so I didn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:29:59.920" style="s2">up those in the red pill documentary and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.450" end="00:30:02.679" style="s2">because if we if we just want to sound</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.920" end="00:30:04.090" style="s2">cherry-pick sound bites and analyze</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.679" end="00:30:06.610" style="s2">those we could have a ten hour</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.090" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">that I think would be hard to sit</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.610" end="00:30:12.220" style="s2">through so I tried to make it more about</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:14.169" style="s2">the ideas and the issues and an</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.220" end="00:30:17.340" style="s2">interesting journey for the audience to</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.169" end="00:30:21.880" style="s2">go on and there is also this paradox of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.340" end="00:30:27.100" style="s2">you being criticized by male journalists</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.880" end="00:30:29.620" style="s2">as a betrayal of of women which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.100" end="00:30:31.870" style="s2">seen a few of my female friends who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.620" end="00:30:35.640" style="s2">a slightly different take on feminism</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.870" end="00:30:38.200" style="s2">are often accused by by men of letting</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.640" end="00:30:42.100" style="s2">themselves into either internalized</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.200" end="00:30:44.470" style="s2">misogyny or some kind of yeah this weird</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.100" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">paradox of okay so as a man you are</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.470" end="00:30:48.340" style="s2">devaluing my experience as a woman by</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:50.380" style="s2">telling me that I&#39;m that I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.340" end="00:30:52.539" style="s2">wrong views and it&#39;s that&#39;s this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.380" end="00:30:55.450" style="s2">weird paradox catch-22 that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.539" end="00:30:56.620" style="s2">that okay are you not doing exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.450" end="00:30:58.390" style="s2">thing that you&#39;re accusing me of doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.620" end="00:31:01.270" style="s2">by invalidating my experience as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.390" end="00:31:05.080" style="s2">yes yes I don&#39;t think I could put it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.270" end="00:31:07.750" style="s2">better than that exactly yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.080" end="00:31:09.820" style="s2">know I I have had a lot of you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:12.929" style="s2">experiences as a woman that I felt I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.820" end="00:31:16.360" style="s2">mistreated as a woman and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.929" end="00:31:21.250" style="s2">became a feminist you know now 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.360" end="00:31:23.169" style="s2">ago so I you know a lot of feminists who</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.250" end="00:31:25.570" style="s2">would like to criticize me saying that I</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.169" end="00:31:26.919" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in this bubble where I&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.570" end="00:31:28.809" style="s2">looked at the men&#39;s rights movement and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.919" end="00:31:31.029" style="s2">I didn&#39;t look closely enough at feminism</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.809" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">but I did I mean I was a feminist and</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.029" end="00:31:34.120" style="s2">never heard about the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:35.950" style="s2">movement for ten years and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.120" end="00:31:38.470" style="s2">real iterator I read and the blog&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.950" end="00:31:40.870" style="s2">read but even the experiences I had</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.470" end="00:31:43.510" style="s2">before coming the coming of feminists I</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.870" end="00:31:47.919" style="s2">I know the struggles that women face</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.510" end="00:31:49.299" style="s2">absolutely you know more more than I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:52.059" style="s2">think a lot of people would realize</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.299" end="00:31:58.029" style="s2">because I you know do try to maintain a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.059" end="00:32:00.220" style="s2">level of privacy so yeah I mean for any</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.029" end="00:32:04.299" style="s2">male journalist to think that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.220" end="00:32:11.260" style="s2">I am betraying all women and that I am</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.299" end="00:32:15.429" style="s2">engaging and wrong think and and not you</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.260" end="00:32:15.700" style="s2">know believing women&#39;s stories or hey I</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.429" end="00:32:19.240" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.700" end="00:32:24.059" style="s2">no I yeah I I don&#39;t even know how to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.240" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">respond to people like that because um</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.059" end="00:32:29.409" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve looked through a lot so and do</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:31.690" style="s2">you ever ask yourself that question have</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.409" end="00:32:35.740" style="s2">I internalized misogyny how am i letting</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.690" end="00:32:42.730" style="s2">letting my sisters down any of that hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.740" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">I let my sisters down well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.730" end="00:32:49.049" style="s2">one of the hardest parts about releasing</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:52.510" style="s2">the film was I felt a loss of sisterhood</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.049" end="00:32:55.299" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m not a men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.510" end="00:32:57.220" style="s2">activist and of the women I&#39;ve met in</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.299" end="00:33:01.510" style="s2">the men&#39;s rights movement I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.220" end="00:33:04.679" style="s2">like I&#39;m a part of a sisterhood so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.510" end="00:33:07.899" style="s2">haven&#39;t found this sisterhood since</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.679" end="00:33:10.029" style="s2">taking away the label feminists from</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.899" end="00:33:13.539" style="s2">myself I I don&#39;t feel like I fit into</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.029" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">any kind of sisterhood group now you</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.539" end="00:33:17.409" style="s2">know I met some women and a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:19.779" style="s2">would call themselves egalitarian or</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.409" end="00:33:23.590" style="s2">equalist or humanists and I think I am</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.779" end="00:33:24.700" style="s2">close to the way they think but but</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.590" end="00:33:27.789" style="s2">there&#39;s not the same kind of camaraderie</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.700" end="00:33:30.730" style="s2">that I experienced in feminism and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.789" end="00:33:32.049" style="s2">don&#39;t think I let the sisterhood down</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.730" end="00:33:34.389" style="s2">because I think there are plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.049" end="00:33:37.059" style="s2">people who are fighting for valid</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.389" end="00:33:39.730" style="s2">women&#39;s rights you know sex trafficking</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.059" end="00:33:41.860" style="s2">and maternity leaves and you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.730" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">of issues that I do want to see address</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.860" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">and people are talking about them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:47.289" style="s2">having conferences for them so I know</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:51.929" style="s2">that work is being done and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.289" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">preventing that work from being done but</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.929" end="00:33:58.360" style="s2">you know I think in the way that I am</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:34:01.630" style="s2">helping the sisterhood is possibly in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.360" end="00:34:03.370" style="s2">relationships I think the women who have</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.630" end="00:34:05.649" style="s2">watched the red pill movie who were self</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.370" end="00:34:07.809" style="s2">identifying feminists have really</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.649" end="00:34:09.790" style="s2">benefited from opening their eyes to</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.809" end="00:34:14.500" style="s2">men&#39;s issues and seeing their own male</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.790" end="00:34:15.819" style="s2">relationships in new light and so you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.500" end="00:34:17.950" style="s2">know I think I have done a lot for women</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.819" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">another criticism that people have of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.950" end="00:34:21.669" style="s2">the film is sort of why are you showing</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:22.830" style="s2">all of these angry guys you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.669" end="00:34:25.690" style="s2">why a lot of feminists become</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.690" end="00:34:31.030" style="s2">that enrages them and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.270" end="00:34:34.060" style="s2">rightfully so you know there&#39;s I think</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.530" end="00:34:55.870" style="s2">bubbles on the surface of what&#39;s boiling</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:35:00.940" style="s2">underneath and you know I think to write</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.870" end="00:35:03.550" style="s2">off activists as just angry whiners or</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.940" end="00:35:04.930" style="s2">you know crybabies or ferment so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.550" end="00:35:07.900" style="s2">activists that they need a man up or</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.930" end="00:35:11.220" style="s2">something like that you know it actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.900" end="00:35:13.540" style="s2">just kind of justifies what or it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.220" end="00:35:15.880" style="s2">validates and supports what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.540" end="00:35:18.820" style="s2">saying is that we we do have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.880" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">resistance to having compassion for men</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.820" end="00:35:25.810" style="s2">and men&#39;s issues and you know even right</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:28.480" style="s2">now the men&#39;s rights movement is</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.810" end="00:35:30.970" style="s2">debating whether they should take men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.480" end="00:35:33.160" style="s2">rights out of their title and because</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.970" end="00:35:36.850" style="s2">it&#39;s been smeared so much in the media</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.160" end="00:35:40.060" style="s2">that there and the hearing men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.850" end="00:35:41.470" style="s2">makes people scoff and laugh and and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.060" end="00:35:43.600" style="s2">they&#39;re wondering should we rebrand it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.470" end="00:35:45.640" style="s2">as a gender equality movement or</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.600" end="00:35:48.370" style="s2">something like that and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.640" end="00:35:52.090" style="s2">very telling as well that just even</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.370" end="00:35:55.110" style="s2">having the word men in a men&#39;s group or</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.090" end="00:35:58.590" style="s2">a men&#39;s forum or any any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.110" end="00:36:02.040" style="s2">organization with the word men in it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.590" end="00:36:07.840" style="s2">already at a disadvantage and is open to</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.040" end="00:36:10.330" style="s2">you know being fired at and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.840" end="00:36:14.140" style="s2">I think that&#39;s worth looking into and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.330" end="00:36:17.500" style="s2">thinking about that why why is our</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.140" end="00:36:19.240" style="s2">society so willing to make money mend</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.500" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">the butt of all jokes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.240" end="00:36:25.000" style="s2">acceptable and you know for truly for</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:28.450" style="s2">gender equality shouldn&#39;t we care about</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:30.460" style="s2">all genders the me2 moment happened very</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.450" end="00:36:32.970" style="s2">soon after releasing the film what did</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.460" end="00:36:35.340" style="s2">you personally make of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.970" end="00:36:45.990" style="s2">oh well the me to movement did you post</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.340" end="00:36:50.190" style="s2">me too we know I didn&#39;t I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.990" end="00:36:54.180" style="s2">it&#39;s good that the movement started if</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.190" end="00:36:57.000" style="s2">it helps a lot of women open up about</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:37:01.740" style="s2">their their story and and their issues</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.000" end="00:37:03.810" style="s2">and feel more accepted and embraced and</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.740" end="00:37:08.430" style="s2">speaking about those stories with their</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.810" end="00:37:11.180" style="s2">friends or family I think the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.430" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">the movement is in the language and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.180" end="00:37:17.460" style="s2">identifying only female victims and male</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">perpetrators and when there have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.460" end="00:37:21.480" style="s2">people have come forward wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:25.140" style="s2">participate in the hashtag me to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.480" end="00:37:29.940" style="s2">movement as a male victim or accusing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.140" end="00:37:34.140" style="s2">female perpetrator I think you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.940" end="00:37:35.910" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of disappointing you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.140" end="00:37:37.980" style="s2">know reactions to that where they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.910" end="00:37:39.480" style="s2">not openly embraced and and given the</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.980" end="00:37:41.910" style="s2">same kind of treatment as a female</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.480" end="00:37:47.310" style="s2">victim with a male perpetrator is given</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.910" end="00:37:49.470" style="s2">so I think you know just discussing</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.310" end="00:37:52.349" style="s2">these issues is really important and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.470" end="00:37:53.700" style="s2">have you know sexual assault and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.349" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">harassment was definitely one of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.700" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2">issues that made me a feminist so I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:38:01.950" style="s2">a big soft spot for that issue and even</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.210" end="00:38:05.460" style="s2">my first documentary called daddy I do</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.950" end="00:38:08.660" style="s2">about sex education largely talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.460" end="00:38:11.730" style="s2">sexual assault and abuse and rape and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.660" end="00:38:14.490" style="s2">you know these horrible stories that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.730" end="00:38:17.550" style="s2">know have been going on far longer than</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.490" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">the me to movement has come out so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.550" end="00:38:23.849" style="s2">know I know it&#39;s prevalent and it sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:26.490" style="s2">of increasingly feels like the culture</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.849" end="00:38:29.550" style="s2">at large is a kind of dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.490" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">relationship between men and women like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.550" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">through the me to movement of times art</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:35.730" style="s2">movement so that certainly the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.280" style="s2">Hillary election just looked like it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.730" end="00:38:43.320" style="s2">kind of yeah these gender dynamics were</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.280" end="00:38:45.300" style="s2">playing out on the wider stage so my my</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.320" end="00:38:46.619" style="s2">question is what does the space on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.300" end="00:38:49.530" style="s2">other side of that look like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.619" end="00:38:51.180" style="s2">and in a way what I guess we talked</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.530" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">about this is Warren Farrell and mine to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.180" end="00:38:55.410" style="s2">be with him like what seems to be needed</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.740" style="s2">as a kind of one&#39;s like relationship</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.410" end="00:39:00.599" style="s2">counseling on a on a wife cultural scale</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.740" end="00:39:02.130" style="s2">like how do how do you resolve this</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.599" end="00:39:05.480" style="s2">debate do you have a sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.130" end="00:39:09.690" style="s2">space on the other side of these this</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.480" end="00:39:12.510" style="s2">dynamic looks like I think the best way</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.690" end="00:39:16.890" style="s2">for me to explain my view on that is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.510" end="00:39:19.800" style="s2">bring it down to a very small experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.890" end="00:39:22.590" style="s2">which is my relationship with my now</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.800" end="00:39:26.130" style="s2">husband over about four weeks we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.590" end="00:39:27.480" style="s2">together seven years and the last five</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.130" end="00:39:30.030" style="s2">years I&#39;ve been working on the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.480" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">movie so he&#39;s seen me through quite a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.030" end="00:39:39.750" style="s2">transition what really worked for our</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:41.940" style="s2">relationship was the first two years of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.750" end="00:39:45.660" style="s2">our relationship I was very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.940" end="00:39:47.340" style="s2">feminist mindset and I did and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.660" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">saying this is all feminists and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.340" end="00:39:54.089" style="s2">trying to you know put down feminists by</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:56.940" style="s2">saying what kind of feminist I was but I</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.089" end="00:40:01.619" style="s2">did most of the talking and he did most</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.940" end="00:40:04.859" style="s2">the listening and my moods really set</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.619" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">the stage for how home life was going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.859" end="00:40:11.670" style="s2">be so if I was happy as I say happy wife</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:13.859" style="s2">happy life that was pretty much the case</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.670" end="00:40:16.200" style="s2">I I did the complaining and he did the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.859" end="00:40:18.890" style="s2">resolving and I had a lot to complain</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.200" end="00:40:23.790" style="s2">about and mostly it was housework and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.890" end="00:40:26.609" style="s2">what I thought were roles put on me by</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.790" end="00:40:28.470" style="s2">the patriarchy expected gender roles of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.609" end="00:40:30.320" style="s2">doing the dishes in the laundry and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.470" end="00:40:32.849" style="s2">cleaning even though we&#39;re both working</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.320" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">roughly the same amount hours I may work</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.849" end="00:40:36.930" style="s2">at eight-hour day and he would work on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:40.109" style="s2">11 or 12 hour a day but we get home and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:41.369" style="s2">and it was I thought expected that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.109" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">would have dinner ready in the house</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.369" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">clean and I really resented that but he</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:49.589" style="s2">was also paying most of the bills</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">because he did make more money and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.589" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">that as another effect of the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:55.630" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:57.279" style="s2">you know I did believe in the pay gap as</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.630" end="00:40:59.609" style="s2">being discrimination against women at</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.279" end="00:41:03.809" style="s2">the time I no longer believe that to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.609" end="00:41:06.190" style="s2">you know the short story of that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.809" end="00:41:10.059" style="s2">then I started making the red pill movie</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.190" end="00:41:12.010" style="s2">and a lot changed with that not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.059" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">starting to hear men&#39;s issues and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.010" end="00:41:16.990" style="s2">realizing all the ways that I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.410" end="00:41:20.980" style="s2">privilege as a woman a white woman in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.990" end="00:41:23.559" style="s2">today&#39;s society but also seeing all the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.980" end="00:41:25.510" style="s2">ways that men really are disadvantaged</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.559" end="00:41:27.160" style="s2">how would you explain that that you the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.510" end="00:41:28.569" style="s2">privilege that you have as a white woman</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.160" end="00:41:29.950" style="s2">cuz that what some people won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.569" end="00:41:33.339" style="s2">understand what you mean by that or will</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.950" end="00:41:36.130" style="s2">react against it I well certainly if we</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.339" end="00:41:39.369" style="s2">had children I have I would have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.130" end="00:41:41.500" style="s2">of advantages there especially if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.369" end="00:41:46.059" style="s2">were going through a divorce but also</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.500" end="00:41:48.849" style="s2">social reactions if I were to take my</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.059" end="00:41:50.859" style="s2">kids to the playground alone there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.849" end="00:41:53.140" style="s2">real question about you know me being on</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.859" end="00:41:56.109" style="s2">my phone or taking photos of them and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.140" end="00:41:58.839" style="s2">walking along with them but if a man</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.839" end="00:42:03.849" style="s2">and be taking photos of them on his</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.240" end="00:42:06.039" style="s2">phone there could be and there have been</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.849" end="00:42:08.230" style="s2">police called on fathers doing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.039" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">let&#39;s say yeah in the dating world</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.230" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of advantages you know I</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:20.230" style="s2">bit about that but that men still have</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.000" end="00:42:22.450" style="s2">the risk of approaching and hitting on</p>

<p begin="00:42:22.450" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">whereas women are I have to say yes or</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.630" end="00:42:31.000" style="s2">no and get that privilege and and I when</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.500" style="s2">I started to think would I rather be in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.000" end="00:42:34.059" style="s2">the position of having to approach</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.500" end="00:42:37.059" style="s2">someone for a potential relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.059" end="00:42:39.670" style="s2">versus be approached I would rather be</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.059" end="00:42:42.099" style="s2">approached and and it does feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.670" end="00:42:44.259" style="s2">power position to just say yes or no I</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.099" end="00:42:46.380" style="s2">mean if you&#39;re a royalty that would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.259" end="00:42:48.789" style="s2">the position you&#39;re sitting in not</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.380" end="00:42:54.099" style="s2">trying to plead your case and show your</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.789" end="00:42:56.380" style="s2">resume so I started to see that meant</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.099" end="00:42:57.549" style="s2">that I really do have a lot of issues</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.380" end="00:43:01.600" style="s2">that I never thought about before</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.549" end="00:43:03.910" style="s2">whether their rights or just societal</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.600" end="00:43:07.060" style="s2">and expectations on them obviously</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.910" end="00:43:09.610" style="s2">masculinity is is a really great for a</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.060" end="00:43:12.520" style="s2">lot of people where they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.610" end="00:43:14.200" style="s2">is good masculine anymore we hear toxic</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.520" end="00:43:16.060" style="s2">put next to the word masculine any more</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.200" end="00:43:18.820" style="s2">than we hear good put next to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.060" end="00:43:22.030" style="s2">masculinity or or positive masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.820" end="00:43:26.290" style="s2">so I think guys have a really hard time</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.030" end="00:43:28.420" style="s2">right now and and even if I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.290" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">in a work space and I&#39;m the only woman</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.420" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">out of you know ten people I I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:38.350" style="s2">that power of that my voice is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:40.990" style="s2">female voice in the room and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.350" end="00:43:44.040" style="s2">even making this film the red pill movie</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.990" end="00:43:46.630" style="s2">I was probably heard and listened to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.040" end="00:43:48.790" style="s2">more because I was a woman making this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.630" end="00:43:52.660" style="s2">film rather than a white man trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.790" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">make it film about men&#39;s rights so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.660" end="00:43:55.900" style="s2">know that&#39;s the culture that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">living in today and and I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.900" end="00:44:03.490" style="s2">that you know my voice as a woman is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:05.140" style="s2">valued and heard certainly and but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.490" end="00:44:06.850" style="s2">I do see a lot of issues that men are</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.140" end="00:44:10.870" style="s2">facing so so when I started to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.850" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">understand the issues men face and apply</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.870" end="00:44:17.650" style="s2">it to my own relationship I I started to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">wonder what my at the time boyfriend was</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.650" end="00:44:23.260" style="s2">going through with maybe sleeping five</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:28.360" style="s2">hours and I working 11 or 12 hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.260" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2">in a laborious job and paying the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.360" end="00:44:31.990" style="s2">majority of the bills and having that</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.950" end="00:44:34.330" style="s2">responsibility that if we can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.990" end="00:44:39.130" style="s2">rent it&#39;s really on his shoulders to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.330" end="00:44:41.440" style="s2">figure that out so after making a red</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.130" end="00:44:44.500" style="s2">pill movie it was the first time in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.440" end="00:44:46.540" style="s2">life that I switched gender roles with</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.500" end="00:44:48.850" style="s2">him and not consciously and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.540" end="00:44:51.640" style="s2">intentionally but it just turned out</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.850" end="00:44:55.690" style="s2">that I had a lot more to do for work and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.640" end="00:44:59.050" style="s2">I was it made more sense for him to help</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.690" end="00:45:01.620" style="s2">me with my work than for him to work</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.050" end="00:45:05.980" style="s2">harder and we support him going to work</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.620" end="00:45:09.100" style="s2">so we focused on my work and he became</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.980" end="00:45:10.320" style="s2">the the homemaker type of gender role</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.100" end="00:45:12.360" style="s2">where he would take care of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.320" end="00:45:16.650" style="s2">and do the cleaning in the laundry and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.360" end="00:45:19.290" style="s2">dishes and I noticed a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.650" end="00:45:21.480" style="s2">that I hadn&#39;t seen before such as I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.290" end="00:45:24.600" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t notice when he did those kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.480" end="00:45:25.950" style="s2">of tasks around the house and he would</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.600" end="00:45:27.150" style="s2">start saying did you see I did the</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.950" end="00:45:29.730" style="s2">dishes and I&#39;d look around the kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.150" end="00:45:31.740" style="s2">like oh yeah oh thanks okay but the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.730" end="00:45:34.050" style="s2">whole day I was focused on paying bills</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.740" end="00:45:36.510" style="s2">and getting the finances in order and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.050" end="00:45:40.670" style="s2">was really stressful and I I realized</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.510" end="00:45:43.110" style="s2">how much I hated being the provider I</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.670" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">realized how hard it was to be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.110" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">breadwinner and how stressful was and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:51.630" style="s2">you know you are thinking months ahead</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.700" style="s2">and what is the financial plan whereas</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.630" end="00:45:56.460" style="s2">you know back when I didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.700" end="00:45:58.650" style="s2">worry about the finances I was feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.460" end="00:46:02.520" style="s2">underappreciated for for cooking the</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.650" end="00:46:05.310" style="s2">dinners but you know going to into both</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.520" end="00:46:08.010" style="s2">roles now I see that that both really</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.310" end="00:46:09.900" style="s2">have a lot to be stressed about and</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.010" end="00:46:11.610" style="s2">worried about and and both really just</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.900" end="00:46:13.620" style="s2">want to be appreciated by the other and</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.610" end="00:46:16.740" style="s2">recognized for their contributions to</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.620" end="00:46:21.450" style="s2">the household so long story short I</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.740" end="00:46:23.940" style="s2">think moving forward for the genders and</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.450" end="00:46:27.450" style="s2">for relationships is really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.940" end="00:46:29.340" style="s2">understand how the other person is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.450" end="00:46:31.320" style="s2">walking in their own shoes and what</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.340" end="00:46:33.420" style="s2">they&#39;re going through and the struggles</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.320" end="00:46:36.180" style="s2">they face and the stresses they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.420" end="00:46:38.730" style="s2">day-to-day and the contributions they do</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.180" end="00:46:43.440" style="s2">make and you know that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.730" end="00:46:46.080" style="s2">is I&#39;ve I now see so all the sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.440" end="00:46:47.820" style="s2">that men make for our society whether</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.080" end="00:46:50.580" style="s2">it&#39;s the road work and the power lines</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.820" end="00:46:53.460" style="s2">or the soldiers you know I have family</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.580" end="00:46:55.260" style="s2">members in the military and and war</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.460" end="00:46:56.760" style="s2">makes me extremely uncomfortable so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.260" end="00:46:59.010" style="s2">usually just choose to never think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.760" end="00:47:01.080" style="s2">it but when I really do start to think</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.010" end="00:47:02.610" style="s2">about the way that they&#39;re putting their</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.080" end="00:47:05.120" style="s2">lives on the line for people they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.610" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">even know but a country they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.120" end="00:47:09.870" style="s2">it&#39;s really powerful and it you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:12.980" style="s2">when you really think about it you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.870" end="00:47:15.690" style="s2">help but get teary-eyed because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.980" end="00:47:19.560" style="s2">they are they are doing so much for our</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.690" end="00:47:21.450" style="s2">society and for their families and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.560" end="00:47:22.410" style="s2">just you know it really saddens me that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.450" end="00:47:26.280" style="s2">so many</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.410" end="00:47:29.430" style="s2">men do go unappreciated in and I hate</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.280" end="00:47:33.450" style="s2">that women went underappreciated when</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.430" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">they were you know the 50s housewife but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.450" end="00:47:37.290" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve changed positively in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:39.390" style="s2">new direction for women and I would like</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.290" end="00:47:42.900" style="s2">to see that happen for men as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.390" end="00:47:44.850" style="s2">I guess for me it&#39;s that a space needs</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.900" end="00:47:47.460" style="s2">to be opened up that we we do listen to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.850" end="00:47:49.080" style="s2">each other that and what you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.460" end="00:47:51.180" style="s2">with that with the film was showing</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.080" end="00:47:52.530" style="s2">there is another side to this and this</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.180" end="00:47:56.310" style="s2">is the same journey I guess that Warren</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.530" end="00:47:58.200" style="s2">Farrell went on that he was a big player</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.310" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">in the in the women&#39;s liberation</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.200" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">movement in the 70s and then started at</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:04.710" style="s2">the same time setting up men&#39;s groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:07.050" style="s2">and saying and then the stories he heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.710" end="00:48:08.820" style="s2">and there kind of turned him on to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.050" end="00:48:10.830" style="s2">realizing wow there are some stories</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.820" end="00:48:12.420" style="s2">that are not being heard men&#39;s issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.830" end="00:48:13.710" style="s2">with custody and wanted to be there for</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.420" end="00:48:15.870" style="s2">their children and not being allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.710" end="00:48:17.820" style="s2">be and all of these sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.870" end="00:48:20.340" style="s2">and but it was when he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.820" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2">bring those stories into into the what</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.340" end="00:48:23.220" style="s2">was then the women&#39;s moving the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:24.120" style="s2">look there are these stories they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.220" end="00:48:27.060" style="s2">being heard as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.120" end="00:48:29.820" style="s2">suddenly they weren&#39;t interested he was</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.060" end="00:48:31.860" style="s2">sort of pushed out so I guess for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.820" end="00:48:34.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like in any dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.860" end="00:48:36.930" style="s2">relationship the only solution is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.440" end="00:48:39.690" style="s2">hear both sides of the story and have a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.930" end="00:48:43.770" style="s2">dialogue between those two definitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.690" end="00:48:46.410" style="s2">and you know I think when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.770" end="00:48:49.230" style="s2">feminist the fear was that if you start</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.410" end="00:48:51.660" style="s2">giving credit to the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.230" end="00:48:53.580" style="s2">movement or men&#39;s issues that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.660" end="00:48:55.290" style="s2">your issues are gonna be put on the back</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.580" end="00:48:57.210" style="s2">burner or that you&#39;re no longer gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.290" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">cared about our funding is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.210" end="00:49:02.880" style="s2">even coming your way for resources and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:04.140" style="s2">that that was a big fear of mine you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.880" end="00:49:06.570" style="s2">know I think there is some debate about</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.140" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">whether or not this is a zero-sum game a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.570" end="00:49:09.830" style="s2">lot of people in the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:13.050" style="s2">movement say it&#39;s not a zero-sum game</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.830" end="00:49:14.340" style="s2">compassion it&#39;s not a zero-sum game but</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:17.370" style="s2">then you can make the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.340" end="00:49:21.230" style="s2">there there is an allotted amount of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.370" end="00:49:25.860" style="s2">finances towards you know any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.230" end="00:49:28.020" style="s2">social issue and if we are going to care</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.860" end="00:49:29.850" style="s2">and talk about men&#39;s issues and try to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.020" end="00:49:32.250" style="s2">find ways to help them which may need a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.850" end="00:49:32.920" style="s2">lot of funding where&#39;s that money going</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.250" end="00:49:37.060" style="s2">to come from</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.920" end="00:49:38.860" style="s2">so it&#39;s not an easy thing and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.060" end="00:49:41.920" style="s2">there that&#39;s why there is so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.860" end="00:49:47.710" style="s2">resistance to the men&#39;s rights argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.920" end="00:49:50.410" style="s2">is fear over funding and and time to</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.710" end="00:49:54.430" style="s2">care about these issues and err time to</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.410" end="00:49:57.130" style="s2">talk about these issues and and also</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.430" end="00:50:00.070" style="s2">when you start realizing that men have</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.130" end="00:50:02.920" style="s2">so many issues of their own you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.070" end="00:50:05.050" style="s2">really say it&#39;s it&#39;s one group an</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.920" end="00:50:07.450" style="s2">entirety that&#39;s oppressed by the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.050" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">group now we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.450" end="00:50:12.340" style="s2">on this together we all have issues to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:15.330" style="s2">care about if we&#39;re all if we all have</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.340" end="00:50:18.340" style="s2">issues is that going to just make them</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.330" end="00:50:21.160" style="s2">like there&#39;s a tie there is no game</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.340" end="00:50:23.590" style="s2">there is no race it&#39;s just a tie and now</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.160" end="00:50:25.780" style="s2">our are people not going to care about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.590" end="00:50:30.670" style="s2">any of the issues because there&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.780" end="00:50:33.700" style="s2">enemy with a victor I also as Paul Elam</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.670" end="00:50:36.430" style="s2">has shown that anger and polarization</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.700" end="00:50:38.680" style="s2">does drive people to to cover the issues</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.430" end="00:50:42.100" style="s2">and which is which is quite I guess</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.680" end="00:50:45.220" style="s2">disappointing in a way for me is that it</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.100" end="00:50:47.560" style="s2">does seem that it&#39;s a useful tactic to</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.220" end="00:50:51.490" style="s2">be able to drum up anger and response</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.560" end="00:50:54.520" style="s2">and reactivity yeah rather than creating</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.490" end="00:50:56.170" style="s2">a space for a genuine dialogue yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.520" end="00:50:58.990" style="s2">especially with social media and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.170" end="00:51:00.910" style="s2">everything at the moment yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.990" end="00:51:03.850" style="s2">the you know the best way to make a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.910" end="00:51:06.040" style="s2">group organize and work together and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.850" end="00:51:07.330" style="s2">have passion about their cause is to</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.040" end="00:51:10.870" style="s2">have a common enemy</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.330" end="00:51:13.390" style="s2">so if men&#39;s rights activists are not the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.870" end="00:51:14.560" style="s2">enemy of feminists what is gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.390" end="00:51:17.200" style="s2">enemy there needs to be something</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.560" end="00:51:22.570" style="s2">identified to keep that that machine</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.200" end="00:51:24.400" style="s2">running so maybe there is an an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.570" end="00:51:27.130" style="s2">that we can find that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.400" end="00:51:28.630" style="s2">preventing women from having equal</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.130" end="00:51:30.390" style="s2">rights and and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.630" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">distinction that a lot of people need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.390" end="00:51:36.820" style="s2">look at when listening to feminist</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:39.490" style="s2">arguments is that equal rights or are</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.820" end="00:51:42.880" style="s2">they looking for ways women to have an</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.490" end="00:51:45.470" style="s2">advantage over men like in family court</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.880" end="00:51:48.109" style="s2">you know do we want shared custody</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.470" end="00:51:49.880" style="s2">or or feminist group really fighting for</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.109" end="00:51:52.520" style="s2">primary custody for the mother in all</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.880" end="00:51:54.290" style="s2">cases so if we&#39;re looking at equal</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.520" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">rights and there&#39;s something preventing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.290" end="00:51:59.510" style="s2">that from happening let&#39;s identify what</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:02.030" style="s2">is that thing but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.510" end="00:52:05.090" style="s2">men&#39;s rights movement preventing women</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.030" end="00:52:07.790" style="s2">from having equal rights you know as far</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.090" end="00:52:09.830" style="s2">as men&#39;s rights activist what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.790" end="00:52:12.770" style="s2">preventing men&#39;s rights activists from</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.830" end="00:52:15.109" style="s2">having equal rights you know and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.770" end="00:52:18.500" style="s2">a lot of debate about could the word</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.109" end="00:52:21.140" style="s2">rights be used or is it just issues but</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.500" end="00:52:23.869" style="s2">there are rights that are being denied</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.140" end="00:52:26.660" style="s2">for men that women do have at least in</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.869" end="00:52:28.790" style="s2">the u.s. with genital integrity you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.660" end="00:52:30.890" style="s2">it is outlawed that a girl be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.790" end="00:52:34.340" style="s2">circumcised but boys there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.890" end="00:52:37.220" style="s2">no limitation or restriction on that DNA</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.340" end="00:52:40.090" style="s2">testing should you as a person have the</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.220" end="00:52:43.099" style="s2">right to know that you are a father or</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.090" end="00:52:46.760" style="s2">that the child is in fact yours which</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.099" end="00:52:48.650" style="s2">are different story lines to know you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.760" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">have a child you know there are many</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.650" end="00:52:52.880" style="s2">women who get pregnant leave the state</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:56.030" style="s2">and never tell the father that he is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.880" end="00:52:56.900" style="s2">fact the father so should that be a</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.030" end="00:52:58.940" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.900" end="00:53:00.920" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve feminism never defined</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.940" end="00:53:03.890" style="s2">that as a right because they only looked</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.920" end="00:53:06.710" style="s2">at women&#39;s rights and that wasn&#39;t a part</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.890" end="00:53:08.210" style="s2">of the agenda but I would consider that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.710" end="00:53:10.550" style="s2">a human right to know that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.210" end="00:53:11.270" style="s2">parent but only men have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.550" end="00:53:14.869" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.270" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">so there are rights that are being</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.869" end="00:53:20.839" style="s2">tonight for men and who or what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">preventing that from happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.839" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">I think men&#39;s rights activists to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:31.430" style="s2">have a lot of valid points to make that</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:34.070" style="s2">feminism and the the mainstream view of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.430" end="00:53:36.619" style="s2">gender politics is really the feminist</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.070" end="00:53:39.470" style="s2">ideology and they do have the most</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.619" end="00:53:42.460" style="s2">funding they do have you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.470" end="00:53:46.700" style="s2">people who become journalists or</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.460" end="00:53:49.220" style="s2">university professors are feminists are</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.700" end="00:53:52.760" style="s2">self identifying feminists or even self</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.220" end="00:53:55.369" style="s2">identifying radical feminists so those</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.760" end="00:53:56.039" style="s2">are positions of power in university in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.369" end="00:54:00.220" style="s2">the media</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.039" end="00:54:03.009" style="s2">politicians so you know I think men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.220" end="00:54:04.930" style="s2">rights activists may have a valid point</p>
