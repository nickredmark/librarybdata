<p begin="00:00:05.690" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">so I really want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.940" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">intellectual dark web which now is</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:16.920" style="s2">probably nearly two years old since it</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">was kind of formally unveiled in the New</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.920" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">York Times and the Barry Weiss article</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">and we&#39;ve obviously featured the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:27.990" style="s2">quite a lot in rebel wisdom we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.369" end="00:00:29.910" style="s2">of looked at it like I was really</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.990" end="00:00:33.860" style="s2">fascinated by it from the beginning the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.910" end="00:00:36.510" style="s2">the idea of I think when we first talked</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.860" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">you you said something about how all</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.510" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">truths must align is that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">true narratives must reconcile all true</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">narratives must reconcile so from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:53.190" style="s2">outset I kind of had this idea of could</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">we have like the these public</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.190" end="00:00:56.309" style="s2">conversations where these different sort</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:58.670" style="s2">of maps of the world for example like</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.309" end="00:01:01.230" style="s2">children Peterson&#39;s Jungian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.670" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">evolutionary biology is there a is there</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.230" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">alignment it&#39;s a way that these can come</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">together and there&#39;s this sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">of excited say a sense of real</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">excitement at the beginning some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">those first encounters on the Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:16.890" style="s2">report you and Eric Jordan and Ben</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:18.509" style="s2">Shapiro there&#39;s this sort of sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.890" end="00:01:21.979" style="s2">really a live conversation that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.509" end="00:01:24.330" style="s2">somewhere new and this sense of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.979" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">think we call it kind of thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.330" end="00:01:28.220" style="s2">public and I know that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">before about the need for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.220" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">spaces where people feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:35.900" style="s2">enough to be honest and that the IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:38.009" style="s2">a place where you could actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.900" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">manufacture that kind of safety and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.009" end="00:01:42.020" style="s2">think that&#39;s all of that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:45.049" style="s2">valuable but I also have this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.020" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">certainly over the last couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.049" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">some of that for me there hasn&#39;t been as</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:53.670" style="s2">much novelty and I&#39;ve also did a talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">recently at a university in America</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.670" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">where I&#39;ve sort of talked about where I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:01:59.130" style="s2">saw some of the failure points or some</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:00.990" style="s2">of the places where the IDW didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.130" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">necessarily push on to a new resolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.990" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">I&#39;d love to ask a few questions about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">that what&#39;s your what&#39;s your sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:11.930" style="s2">the trajectory of the IDW and where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:15.890" style="s2">at now in</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.930" end="00:02:20.750" style="s2">20:20 well I have to say to be candid I</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.890" end="00:02:25.719" style="s2">missed the IDW I feel like the IDW was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.750" end="00:02:30.500" style="s2">very interesting dynamic place to be and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.719" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">it isn&#39;t gone but I also don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.500" end="00:02:37.129" style="s2">being active and I must say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">concerned about what that means you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.129" end="00:02:41.780" style="s2">if it&#39;s taking a break and going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">re-emerge in some sense then that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.780" end="00:02:50.389" style="s2">well and good on the other hand I worry</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">that the the IDW space did not fully</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.389" end="00:02:59.900" style="s2">understand what threatened it and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:03:03.129" style="s2">the fact that it is it is a quiet space</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.900" end="00:03:06.230" style="s2">at the moment might be reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.129" end="00:03:07.609" style="s2">forces we we didn&#39;t understand now of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.230" end="00:03:11.719" style="s2">course there&#39;s also a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.609" end="00:03:15.379" style="s2">happenstance in that obviously Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.719" end="00:03:19.669" style="s2">Peterson has had a health crisis along</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.379" end="00:03:23.060" style="s2">with his wife Tammy and that has taken</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.669" end="00:03:25.010" style="s2">him out of the public eye for a period</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.060" end="00:03:26.840" style="s2">of time and that has obviously had an</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.010" end="00:03:30.519" style="s2">impact on the space but it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.840" end="00:03:34.699" style="s2">only thing that that we encountered and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.519" end="00:03:37.489" style="s2">anyway I&#39;d like to see the IDW or some</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.699" end="00:03:40.639" style="s2">outgrowth of it return and pick up where</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.489" end="00:03:43.009" style="s2">the lively IDW that we remember left off</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.639" end="00:03:44.629" style="s2">mmm because this is one other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.009" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">I&#39;ve been sort of tracking since the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.629" end="00:03:49.939" style="s2">beginning I think the for me the naming</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:52.009" style="s2">of the IDW the name of the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.939" end="00:03:53.659" style="s2">dark web was sort of the coming to</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.009" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">consciousness and I&#39;d love to hear if</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.659" end="00:03:56.689" style="s2">you agree with this or you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.060" style="s2">different perspective was the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.689" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">becoming to consciousness of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.060" end="00:04:03.829" style="s2">alternative media space as an entity in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:06.709" style="s2">itself but you had this you had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.829" end="00:04:09.169" style="s2">podcasters a lot of personalities like</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.709" end="00:04:11.930" style="s2">Sam Harris Joe Rogan who become very</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.169" end="00:04:13.669" style="s2">popular in sort of growing in the shade</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.930" end="00:04:16.009" style="s2">or in between the cracks of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.669" end="00:04:17.930" style="s2">mainstream media and the naming of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.009" end="00:04:20.450" style="s2">intellectual dark web was a way of sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.930" end="00:04:21.889" style="s2">of saying oh it&#39;s now a thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.450" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">actually a thing and there is another</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.889" end="00:04:26.750" style="s2">center of power that is distinct from</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:29.240" style="s2">the mainstream media and it and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.750" end="00:04:30.469" style="s2">showed up maybe a lot of the flaws and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.240" end="00:04:33.380" style="s2">the things that mainstream media weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.469" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">talking about but also what what I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.380" end="00:04:37.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen as well as sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:40.849" style="s2">evolution of what the expectations are</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.400" end="00:04:43.159" style="s2">of of an entity that now has a an equal</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.849" end="00:04:45.590" style="s2">or maybe even some in some places more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.159" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">power than to shape narratives in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.590" end="00:04:49.279" style="s2">mainstream media does so in a way would</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:51.979" style="s2">you would you agree with that that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.279" end="00:04:54.289" style="s2">was sort of the naming of a maybe an</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.979" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">emergent entity that hadn&#39;t previously</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.289" end="00:04:58.820" style="s2">been named and that&#39;s why the name the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:00.889" style="s2">intellectual dollop sort of took off and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.820" end="00:05:05.710" style="s2">you saw a lot of it had a strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.889" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">magnetic potential well I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.710" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">sometimes faulted for always seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">things in biological terms but I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:13.940" style="s2">argue that almost all the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:16.760" style="s2">see that way are actually biology or a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.940" end="00:05:19.930" style="s2">manifestation of it in this case what</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.760" end="00:05:23.180" style="s2">you have is a niche space where a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.930" end="00:05:26.449" style="s2">completely corrupt and broken media</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.180" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">apparatus left everybody in kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.449" end="00:05:32.949" style="s2">low level of constant starvation for</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:36.349" style="s2">anything authentic and decent and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.949" end="00:05:40.279" style="s2">unexpected and certain folks were</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.349" end="00:05:43.789" style="s2">exploring that space Joe Rogan pioneered</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.279" end="00:05:47.659" style="s2">an entire mechanism for interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.789" end="00:05:51.560" style="s2">that space as did Sam Harris Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.659" end="00:05:53.570" style="s2">was creating an entirely distinct</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.560" end="00:05:56.330" style="s2">mechanism of inhabiting that space and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.570" end="00:06:00.770" style="s2">at the point that intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.330" end="00:06:05.630" style="s2">was named by Eric in effect what I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.770" end="00:06:09.949" style="s2">he was doing was describing a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.630" end="00:06:12.919" style="s2">that was quietly evolving in this niche</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.949" end="00:06:14.990" style="s2">and the niche is still there because of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.919" end="00:06:17.150" style="s2">course the hunger is still there the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.990" end="00:06:19.610" style="s2">media hasn&#39;t gotten any better in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.150" end="00:06:25.219" style="s2">it&#39;s still playing the same games that</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.610" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">it was playing in 2017 but the question</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.219" end="00:06:30.289" style="s2">of what inhabits that space has become</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.050" end="00:06:32.629" style="s2">more complicated for various different</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.289" end="00:06:34.759" style="s2">reasons I mean one of them simply being</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.629" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">that there is now wide recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.759" end="00:06:39.800" style="s2">there is a space</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:41.020" style="s2">that means maybe for both better and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.800" end="00:06:43.970" style="s2">worse that there is an economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:46.669" style="s2">opportunity in that space which lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">economic entities are now trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.669" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">capitalize on so that&#39;s now a hazard</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:56.180" style="s2">that was much smaller a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">ago by virtue of the fact that most</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.180" end="00:07:00.379" style="s2">people weren&#39;t aware of it and what do</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:02.539" style="s2">you mean by that what what are you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.379" end="00:07:05.300" style="s2">saying coming in he talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.539" end="00:07:07.159" style="s2">with the idea of the grifter oh no</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.300" end="00:07:08.599" style="s2">actually grifters weren&#39;t anywhere on my</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.159" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">mind though that&#39;s obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.599" end="00:07:14.710" style="s2">manifestation of the same process that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:17.810" style="s2">there are grifters who will learn what</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.710" end="00:07:22.370" style="s2">messages are resonant amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.810" end="00:07:23.930" style="s2">audience of the IDW and start parroting</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.370" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">them for cynical reasons that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.930" end="00:07:31.719" style="s2">certainly a phenomenon we&#39;ve seen but</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:36.050" style="s2">there&#39;s also a recognition amongst very</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.719" end="00:07:38.979" style="s2">standard economic entities that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.050" end="00:07:41.690" style="s2">are I ball x&#39; that are searching for</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.979" end="00:07:44.719" style="s2">authentic content of a counterintuitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.690" end="00:07:49.159" style="s2">type and that many of them have ended up</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.719" end="00:07:51.880" style="s2">in IDW space and you know what can we do</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.159" end="00:07:54.199" style="s2">with that it&#39;s just the simple standard</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.880" end="00:07:56.360" style="s2">question that capitalism is always</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.199" end="00:07:59.060" style="s2">pointing at everything which is how can</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.360" end="00:08:01.539" style="s2">we turn that into a profit and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.060" end="00:08:04.069" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.539" end="00:08:07.550" style="s2">profitability but the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.069" end="00:08:10.719" style="s2">profit to be made threatens to do to IDW</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.550" end="00:08:14.509" style="s2">space what it did to journalism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.719" end="00:08:18.199" style="s2">anyway I think the one advantage that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.509" end="00:08:21.080" style="s2">our DW space has is that maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.199" end="00:08:25.039" style="s2">aware that it is supposed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.080" end="00:08:28.819" style="s2">alternative to a broken media and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.039" end="00:08:32.539" style="s2">offers the possibility of resisting and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.819" end="00:08:34.519" style="s2">how would you define IDW space because</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.539" end="00:08:37.490" style="s2">that was another point that I made in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.519" end="00:08:41.990" style="s2">the in the talk was that there does seem</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.490" end="00:08:43.250" style="s2">to be a lot of energy and desire in and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.990" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">certainly around the time when it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.250" end="00:08:48.170" style="s2">named among a lot of people for good</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:49.370" style="s2">faith dialogue for discussion of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.170" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">kind of issues</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.370" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">and it it never feels like it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like it ever quite went</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:58.100" style="s2">beyond the the people who were named in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">that initial article and became more of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.100" end="00:09:02.890" style="s2">a kind of cultural polar public movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:11.089" style="s2">so first let&#39;s talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.510" end="00:09:17.770" style="s2">what IDW space is IDW space as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.089" end="00:09:23.540" style="s2">can tell is a an environment in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.770" end="00:09:26.060" style="s2">the priority is put on stating what one</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.540" end="00:09:28.700" style="s2">actually believes irrespective of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.060" end="00:09:32.690" style="s2">social consequences of those statements</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.700" end="00:09:37.150" style="s2">and of partnering in discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.690" end="00:09:40.700" style="s2">other people on the basis that you hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.150" end="00:09:44.660" style="s2">the discovery of truth to be a higher</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.700" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">value than pushing your own agenda and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.660" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">think the IDW to me it was a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:54.830" style="s2">of something and it was a highly</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:56.089" style="s2">successful prototype the question then</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.830" end="00:09:59.209" style="s2">is once you have a highly successful</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.089" end="00:10:04.490" style="s2">prototype of discussions in which people</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.209" end="00:10:06.709" style="s2">prove that they are capable of updating</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.490" end="00:10:09.470" style="s2">on the basis of new information capable</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.709" end="00:10:12.920" style="s2">of delivering their own perspective even</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.470" end="00:10:16.279" style="s2">if it puts them in jeopardy all of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.920" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">characteristics what do you do to bring</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.279" end="00:10:20.529" style="s2">others in because now the world is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:22.700" style="s2">alerted to the fact that there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.529" end="00:10:24.350" style="s2">something with a lot of eyeballs on it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.700" end="00:10:26.690" style="s2">so the desire to figure out how to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.350" end="00:10:28.580" style="s2">into that conversation is very high and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.690" end="00:10:31.700" style="s2">the danger of people entering it for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.580" end="00:10:35.810" style="s2">wrong reasons is through the roof so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.700" end="00:10:37.430" style="s2">have to solve the question of how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.810" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">broaden the discussion so that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.430" end="00:10:43.640" style="s2">remains dynamic and adds new elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:47.209" style="s2">without killing it by virtue of opening</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.640" end="00:10:50.110" style="s2">the doors and the so called quality</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.209" end="00:10:56.330" style="s2">control dropping through the floor and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.110" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">there has to be some way of making the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.330" end="00:11:02.199" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:06.100" style="s2">modular so that failures do not take</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.199" end="00:11:07.120" style="s2">down the space itself and I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.100" end="00:11:09.190" style="s2">we figured out the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.120" end="00:11:12.100" style="s2">question yet I would love to see the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.190" end="00:11:14.620" style="s2">problem addressed but I think at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.100" end="00:11:16.990" style="s2">moment where we are as we&#39;ve seen a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.620" end="00:11:20.290" style="s2">beautiful proof-of-concept we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.990" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">that people resonate with it that it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.290" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">solves a problem that there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:28.269" style="s2">things that could be said amongst</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">members of the IDW things that need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.269" end="00:11:34.329" style="s2">be said that are still difficult to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:38.139" style="s2">in more mainstream circles and to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.329" end="00:11:40.690" style="s2">extent that people can bootstrap a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.139" end="00:11:44.350" style="s2">conversation that is more capable more</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.690" end="00:11:47.709" style="s2">dynamic more honest and live to tell the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.350" end="00:11:49.570" style="s2">tale we need to foster and I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.709" end="00:11:52.440" style="s2">the things that I&#39;ve noticed as well is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.570" end="00:11:54.279" style="s2">that if this is more of a web-based</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.440" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">insurgency and I&#39;d say that it probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.279" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">is the failure conditions online are</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:11:59.410" style="s2">very different from the failure</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">conditions of the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.410" end="00:12:04.329" style="s2">mainstream media you get a groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:05.260" style="s2">you get kind of the fact that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.329" end="00:12:06.850" style="s2">is kind of coming from the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.260" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">universities they&#39;re all in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.850" end="00:12:13.149" style="s2">environment on the coasts what I see</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:15.550" style="s2">different in in the online space is this</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.149" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">idea that almost the platform&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.550" end="00:12:19.510" style="s2">themselves are weaponized because you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:20.889" style="s2">know by going on a certain platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.510" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2">you&#39;re exposed to their audience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.889" end="00:12:24.190" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got a comment thread</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.850" end="00:12:27.339" style="s2">underneath every YouTube so every single</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.190" end="00:12:29.949" style="s2">platform there seems to be subject to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.339" end="00:12:32.740" style="s2">these very centrifugal forces pulling to</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.949" end="00:12:34.990" style="s2">one side or the other and that for</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.740" end="00:12:39.100" style="s2">example you have on one side you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.990" end="00:12:41.290" style="s2">someone like Sam cedar who like you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.100" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">just see they&#39;re sort of beating up on</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.290" end="00:12:44.920" style="s2">Dave Rubin and beating up on Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.510" end="00:12:46.029" style="s2">and beating up on some of these figures</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.920" end="00:12:47.769" style="s2">because they know that&#39;s what their</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.029" end="00:12:49.089" style="s2">audience wants but you have very</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.769" end="00:12:51.550" style="s2">different failure conditions in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.089" end="00:12:53.410" style="s2">online space like and you can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.550" end="00:12:55.620" style="s2">gravitational force of the audience</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.410" end="00:13:00.490" style="s2">especially on on YouTube which sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.620" end="00:13:02.350" style="s2">for me leans right because often those</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.490" end="00:13:04.510" style="s2">kind of perspective and not given space</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.350" end="00:13:07.089" style="s2">in the mainstream media like this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.510" end="00:13:09.790" style="s2">something that&#39;s really I think worth</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.089" end="00:13:10.779" style="s2">pulling apart what would what do you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.790" end="00:13:11.379" style="s2">make of that it&#39;s almost like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.779" end="00:13:13.329" style="s2">sped</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.379" end="00:13:16.899" style="s2">some of these failure conditions for for</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.329" end="00:13:19.569" style="s2">online media well at some level were</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.899" end="00:13:24.369" style="s2">damned every which way I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.569" end="00:13:27.339" style="s2">the things about social media space the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.369" end="00:13:31.689" style="s2">positive thing about it was that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.339" end="00:13:34.479" style="s2">allowed something like the IDW to happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.689" end="00:13:37.599" style="s2">and for there to be an awareness of just</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.479" end="00:13:39.989" style="s2">how resonant it was imagine for a second</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.599" end="00:13:44.319" style="s2">a world in which social media existed</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.989" end="00:13:47.829" style="s2">but YouTube videos did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.319" end="00:13:50.319" style="s2">comments thread tweets did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.829" end="00:13:52.809" style="s2">measure of how many people had resonated</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.319" end="00:13:58.499" style="s2">with them or passed them along right</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.809" end="00:14:01.149" style="s2">then the IDW would have been mocked as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.499" end="00:14:04.149" style="s2">insignificant unsuccessful group of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.149" end="00:14:07.179" style="s2">self-important whatevers the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.149" end="00:14:10.629" style="s2">so many people responded to it the fact</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.179" end="00:14:12.729" style="s2">that on tweets from members of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.629" end="00:14:15.189" style="s2">would you would get hundreds or</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.729" end="00:14:18.189" style="s2">thousands of people responding</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.189" end="00:14:20.589" style="s2">positively when if you go to the you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.189" end="00:14:25.379" style="s2">know the anchors of a major news program</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.589" end="00:14:28.509" style="s2">you&#39;d find ten or twenty at most</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.379" end="00:14:30.669" style="s2">indications of interaction that said</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.509" end="00:14:33.009" style="s2">whatever is going on here this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.669" end="00:14:33.879" style="s2">actually an important social force it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.009" end="00:14:37.419" style="s2">can&#39;t be ignored</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.879" end="00:14:39.159" style="s2">you can throw epithets at it you can say</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.419" end="00:14:41.769" style="s2">it&#39;s a gateway to the alt-right or</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.159" end="00:14:44.289" style="s2">whatever other kinds of nonsense were</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.769" end="00:14:49.239" style="s2">tossed around but you can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.289" end="00:14:54.329" style="s2">it&#39;s falling flat and so my point is yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.239" end="00:14:56.829" style="s2">the tendency of social media to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.329" end="00:14:59.889" style="s2">gravitational forces that pull people</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.829" end="00:15:01.659" style="s2">who are living in that space in one</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.889" end="00:15:03.819" style="s2">direction or the other that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.659" end="00:15:06.220" style="s2">dangerous phenomenon and it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.819" end="00:15:07.959" style="s2">dangerous if the directions people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.220" end="00:15:10.119" style="s2">being pulled in are not organic if</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.959" end="00:15:12.339" style="s2">something decides to use social media to</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.119" end="00:15:13.809" style="s2">pull people in some direction they</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.339" end="00:15:16.689" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t otherwise go that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.809" end="00:15:19.419" style="s2">dangerous so it is critically important</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.689" end="00:15:21.069" style="s2">that people in that space figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.419" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">to think independently of their</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.069" end="00:15:24.010" style="s2">audiences so if their audience begins to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:25.570" style="s2">pull them in sumter</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.010" end="00:15:28.180" style="s2">that&#39;s not really of their organic</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.570" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">belief they don&#39;t go and they accept the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.180" end="00:15:33.400" style="s2">social cost of not going but not having</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:36.670" style="s2">the feedback that comes from people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.400" end="00:15:38.890" style="s2">organic interactions online is even more</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.670" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">dangerous in my opinion so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.890" end="00:15:45.520" style="s2">sort of audience capture on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:47.800" style="s2">and lack of feedback and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.520" end="00:15:49.780" style="s2">snuff out promising things by pretending</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.800" end="00:15:52.390" style="s2">that they&#39;re not reaching anyone those</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.780" end="00:15:55.000" style="s2">are two alternate failure conditions</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.390" end="00:15:58.330" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to see those those two</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.000" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">sides because I can remember when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.330" end="00:16:02.800" style="s2">think with either you or it might have</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">been when I talked to Eric originally</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:09.850" style="s2">about the IDW the idea was that these</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:10.960" style="s2">people would be immune from some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.850" end="00:16:12.550" style="s2">failure conditions of the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.960" end="00:16:15.370" style="s2">media because they had their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.550" end="00:16:17.980" style="s2">platforms they were small operators but</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.370" end="00:16:20.200" style="s2">for me that feels kind of naive because</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.980" end="00:16:21.700" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be subject to the whims</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.200" end="00:16:22.870" style="s2">of your audience you&#39;re going to realize</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.700" end="00:16:24.370" style="s2">what your audience won you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.870" end="00:16:26.590" style="s2">give them what they want to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.370" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">so there are going to be new failure</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.590" end="00:16:31.480" style="s2">conditions for online media that and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.680" end="00:16:33.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve been like critical of Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.480" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">quite a few times in the past as being</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.280" end="00:16:38.380" style="s2">for me kind of the the obvious example</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.640" end="00:16:39.910" style="s2">of that recognizing what the audience</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.380" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">wanted and then kind of just giving them</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.930" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">because he talks a lot about Islam he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.460" end="00:16:50.850" style="s2">kind of recognized that he&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:52.630" style="s2">getting kind of some bigoted people</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.850" end="00:16:54.610" style="s2">following him and he sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.630" end="00:16:56.590" style="s2">careful to try and throw them off as</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.610" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">much as possible by talking about how</p>

<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole new set of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:06.280" style="s2">ethical and failure conditions that come</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.520" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">in as being a media personality in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.280" end="00:17:11.949" style="s2">sort of new online world and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:15.459" style="s2">what do you make of that and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.949" end="00:17:19.270" style="s2">personally respond to that well there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.459" end="00:17:21.670" style="s2">a characteristic that a very small</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.270" end="00:17:24.490" style="s2">percentage of people have which i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.670" end="00:17:29.460" style="s2">is disproportionately important in this</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.490" end="00:17:34.120" style="s2">space and it is a deafness</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.460" end="00:17:36.900" style="s2">to social gravity and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.120" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">willingness to endure</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.900" end="00:17:44.280" style="s2">social harm for a cause or a truth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:46.620" style="s2">so to the extent that I&#39;m looking out</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.280" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">across this landscape if somebody does</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.620" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">not demonstrate this capacity even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:52.560" style="s2">they&#39;re saying something I resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:53.910" style="s2">they&#39;re uninteresting to me because I</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.560" end="00:17:56.730" style="s2">know it&#39;s only a matter of time before</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.910" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">they get sucked into some gravity well</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.730" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">around some social truth that isn&#39;t deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">on the other hand if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:12.090" style="s2">essentially immune to the epithets if</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:15.930" style="s2">somebody will go down with the FIP you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.090" end="00:18:18.000" style="s2">think well I know this to be true and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.930" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">the whole world disagrees with me that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.000" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make it any less true so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:26.730" style="s2">therefore you&#39;re not going to get me to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.010" end="00:18:31.770" style="s2">to claim anything else then that person</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.730" end="00:18:36.110" style="s2">is interesting because they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.770" end="00:18:39.210" style="s2">independent so I think the IDW space</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.110" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">brought forward a number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.210" end="00:18:46.020" style="s2">have this unusual characteristics to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:48.660" style="s2">highly unusual degree I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.020" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">was everybody who was associated with</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.660" end="00:18:55.020" style="s2">the space and there is this danger but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:58.020" style="s2">in general I think the lesson or the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.020" end="00:19:01.320" style="s2">meta lesson of IDW is that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.020" end="00:19:07.160" style="s2">characteristic is disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.320" end="00:19:09.630" style="s2">important as society becomes false and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.160" end="00:19:11.310" style="s2">so the reason that the hunger was so</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.630" end="00:19:15.990" style="s2">great the reason that the resonance of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.310" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">the IDW was so great and the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.990" end="00:19:21.210" style="s2">of the process that unfolded in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:24.390" style="s2">couple of years after was that we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.210" end="00:19:26.340" style="s2">to figure out how to cultivate this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.390" end="00:19:30.980" style="s2">ability to say what&#39;s true when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.340" end="00:19:34.950" style="s2">awkward when it&#39;s socially damning and</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.980" end="00:19:36.750" style="s2">that we also need to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.950" end="00:19:39.030" style="s2">value and promote people who have that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.750" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">characteristic so that they do find</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.030" end="00:19:43.770" style="s2">their way into mainstream media for</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:45.270" style="s2">example because in a way in the social</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.770" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">media environment with all content</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.270" end="00:19:49.110" style="s2">creators anyway so being able to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:50.340" style="s2">something that&#39;s going to get you mobbed</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.110" end="00:19:53.610" style="s2">on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.340" end="00:19:55.559" style="s2">is probably liked by your friends and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.610" end="00:19:57.210" style="s2">family and people close to you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.559" end="00:19:59.130" style="s2">probably a process that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.210" end="00:20:00.600" style="s2">have gone through which is maybe why a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.130" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">lot of people resonated with the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.600" end="00:20:04.470" style="s2">because on some will have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:07.320" style="s2">people feel that they have skin in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.470" end="00:20:08.970" style="s2">game on this because we&#39;ve all got the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.320" end="00:20:13.080" style="s2">chance of being kind of socially morbid</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.970" end="00:20:16.770" style="s2">or excluded or shamed humiliated on</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.080" end="00:20:18.779" style="s2">social media I think that&#39;s true many</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.770" end="00:20:21.150" style="s2">people have had the experience and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.779" end="00:20:24.929" style="s2">think it&#39;s very disheartening if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.150" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">come to the conclusion that having been</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.929" end="00:20:30.870" style="s2">mobbed you must have been wrong you must</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:33.779" style="s2">have made an error and seeing people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.870" end="00:20:35.070" style="s2">reject that and live to tell the tale or</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.779" end="00:20:38.250" style="s2">actually end up looking good because</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.070" end="00:20:41.100" style="s2">they resist the mob that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.250" end="00:20:43.529" style="s2">positive lesson for people so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.100" end="00:20:45.390" style="s2">the amount of gratitude that flowed from</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.529" end="00:20:49.580" style="s2">people seeing successful resistance</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.390" end="00:20:53.159" style="s2">against the nonsense was quite rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.580" end="00:21:00.510" style="s2">sometimes I will look at a tweet before</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.159" end="00:21:02.190" style="s2">I post it and I will think yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.510" end="00:21:05.580" style="s2">one&#39;s gonna get me in trouble that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.190" end="00:21:08.010" style="s2">going to be costly or I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.580" end="00:21:11.669" style="s2">certain fraction of my audience that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.010" end="00:21:17.340" style="s2">going to rebel against that very idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.669" end="00:21:21.330" style="s2">and probably walk away and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.340" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">also you know the next thought is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.330" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">but do you believe it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:28.289" style="s2">should you not post that tweet because</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.500" end="00:21:31.700" style="s2">you think people are gonna walk away and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.289" end="00:21:34.020" style="s2">then the next thing is quick you post it</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.700" end="00:21:36.450" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re in a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.020" end="00:21:38.730" style="s2">with yourself do I want to be captured</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.450" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">by my audience no I don&#39;t and that means</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.730" end="00:21:43.049" style="s2">that if my not audience needs to hear</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.010" end="00:22:08.039" style="s2">stating that which needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.159" end="00:22:10.289" style="s2">is again incredibly important and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.039" end="00:22:13.139" style="s2">difficult lesson is that the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.289" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">the rebellion is very concentrated and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.139" end="00:22:20.249" style="s2">the reward if it comes at all will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:22.109" style="s2">delayed it will be diffused it will be</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.249" end="00:22:24.330" style="s2">difficult to detect what it&#39;s about but</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.109" end="00:22:26.279" style="s2">when people see you again and again say</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.330" end="00:22:29.279" style="s2">stuff that somebody needed to say even</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.279" end="00:22:31.409" style="s2">if they disagree with it the best people</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.279" end="00:22:33.299" style="s2">will respond positively today whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.409" end="00:22:34.889" style="s2">they agree with you or not so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.299" end="00:22:36.210" style="s2">mentioned at the beginning something</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.889" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">you&#39;d said about all true narratives</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.210" end="00:22:42.119" style="s2">must reconcile and I wonder whether I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:44.460" style="s2">personally had too much so the IDW one</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.119" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">on one level was showing that people of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.460" end="00:22:48.109" style="s2">different perspectives could have come</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">could have meaningful conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.109" end="00:22:52.139" style="s2">meant that they weren&#39;t falling out they</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:53.309" style="s2">weren&#39;t becoming polarized they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.139" end="00:22:55.049" style="s2">though they were still able to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.309" end="00:22:57.629" style="s2">friends at the end of the day but my</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.049" end="00:22:59.389" style="s2">hope beyond that was that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.629" end="00:23:03.869" style="s2">some shift there might be some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.389" end="00:23:06.269" style="s2">public changing of mine public evidence</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.869" end="00:23:09.149" style="s2">of this kind of process of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.269" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">then led towards this all through</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.149" end="00:23:14.940" style="s2">narratives reconciling and I was I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:17.159" style="s2">been quite disappointed not to have seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.940" end="00:23:19.309" style="s2">that from the IDW conversations we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.159" end="00:23:21.539" style="s2">talk about what why that wasn&#39;t the case</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.309" end="00:23:23.580" style="s2">but do you think it was a naive</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.539" end="00:23:25.129" style="s2">expectation that that might happen or do</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.580" end="00:23:31.820" style="s2">you think it was a missed opportunity I</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.129" end="00:23:35.549" style="s2">don&#39;t think it was either I believe in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.820" end="00:23:38.909" style="s2">sort of fractal hierarchy of timescales</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.549" end="00:23:40.379" style="s2">and there are things which we detect on</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.909" end="00:23:41.789" style="s2">very short time scales which are</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.379" end="00:23:44.869" style="s2">important if somebody changes their mind</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.789" end="00:23:47.759" style="s2">inside a conversation it&#39;s very dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.869" end="00:23:50.039" style="s2">if they change their mind over the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.759" end="00:23:52.470" style="s2">course of six months or a year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.039" end="00:23:54.869" style="s2">still fairly dramatic if it takes four</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.470" end="00:23:58.200" style="s2">years it&#39;s much more subtle and harder</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.869" end="00:24:00.629" style="s2">to track and I&#39;m tracking all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.200" end="00:24:03.419" style="s2">conversations that I was participating</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.629" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">in over the last several years and I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.419" end="00:24:11.100" style="s2">see them moving so there was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:15.059" style="s2">discussion between Brian Greene and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.100" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">Joe Rogan recently in which they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.059" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">discussing</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:26.760" style="s2">their views on religion and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:28.679" style="s2">what Brian Greene&#39;s position was several</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.760" end="00:24:31.700" style="s2">years ago but I know Jo&#39;s because I</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.679" end="00:24:35.880" style="s2">spoke to him about it on his podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.700" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">he was he had moved substantially I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.880" end="00:24:40.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know if to realize that but he had</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:41.820" style="s2">moved substantially in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.260" end="00:24:44.419" style="s2">what I think is now becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.820" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">mainstream understanding which is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.419" end="00:24:52.909" style="s2">religions may be literally false but</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:55.950" style="s2">they evolved for a reason they exist for</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.909" end="00:24:58.650" style="s2">the very fact that they served our</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.950" end="00:25:00.690" style="s2">ancestors now we haven&#39;t gotten publicly</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.650" end="00:25:03.659" style="s2">to the next phase of that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">which is what is their status all right</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.659" end="00:25:06.630" style="s2">and I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:09.419" style="s2">difficult one but I&#39;ve seen people on</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.630" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">both the religious side move in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.419" end="00:25:15.390" style="s2">direction of a adaptive explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:18.059" style="s2">a religious belief and I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.390" end="00:25:20.370" style="s2">on the atheist side move in the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.059" end="00:25:24.840" style="s2">direction so if you&#39;re tracking that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.370" end="00:25:26.940" style="s2">conversation broadly you do see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:31.400" style="s2">movement if you&#39;re waiting for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.940" end="00:25:33.630" style="s2">to acknowledge a transition over some</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.400" end="00:25:36.510" style="s2">short period of time you often don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.630" end="00:25:39.179" style="s2">detect it so what I would say is what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.510" end="00:25:42.679" style="s2">really need to figure out is what our</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.179" end="00:25:46.230" style="s2">benchmarks are what can be stated in</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.679" end="00:25:49.020" style="s2">2020 all right if that benchmark in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.230" end="00:25:51.030" style="s2">same place in 2020 to have we back slid</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.020" end="00:25:54.630" style="s2">have we made progress are we capable of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.030" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">saying difficult things in in a wider</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.630" end="00:26:00.120" style="s2">space in that period and my feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:02.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen the conversation move in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.120" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">positive direction I&#39;ve also seen the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.370" end="00:26:08.490" style="s2">backlash intensify but the movement in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:12.690" style="s2">the positive direction is clearly there</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.490" end="00:26:15.450" style="s2">if you&#39;re paying attention to to certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.690" end="00:26:18.659" style="s2">hallmarks one of the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.450" end="00:26:20.070" style="s2">also seen and I&#39;d love to get your take</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.659" end="00:26:22.380" style="s2">on it cuz I know that this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.070" end="00:26:25.740" style="s2">your phrases that bad faith changes</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.380" end="00:26:28.200" style="s2">everything in a conversation this seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.740" end="00:26:29.400" style="s2">like a very interesting point like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.200" end="00:26:32.910" style="s2">conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.400" end="00:26:35.880" style="s2">bad faith good faith because it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.910" end="00:26:37.530" style="s2">used and I&#39;ve seen it used often now as</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.880" end="00:26:39.390" style="s2">a way of sort of policing who can take</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.530" end="00:26:41.420" style="s2">part in discussions who you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.390" end="00:26:45.300" style="s2">to have on your show for example and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.420" end="00:26:47.280" style="s2">there seems to be no obvious definition</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.300" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">like bad faith is almost always</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.280" end="00:26:51.480" style="s2">something that someone will say about</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:55.350" style="s2">someone else but it will never be no one</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.480" end="00:26:57.930" style="s2">no one would accept that description of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.350" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">themselves so how can you define bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.930" end="00:27:03.000" style="s2">faith in good faith and how can you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:05.490" style="s2">whether and how do you know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.000" end="00:27:06.930" style="s2">being used erroneously as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.490" end="00:27:08.760" style="s2">keeping someone out of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.930" end="00:27:10.110" style="s2">who should actually be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.760" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">conversation it should challenge you in</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.110" end="00:27:16.260" style="s2">some way yeah it&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:20.520" style="s2">would say a couple things one there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.260" end="00:27:22.560" style="s2">an issue with certain parameters that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.520" end="00:27:26.580" style="s2">they fail at the point you attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.560" end="00:27:29.460" style="s2">operationalize them so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.580" end="00:27:32.250" style="s2">that good faith has value in</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.460" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">conversation it may be true that just</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.250" end="00:27:36.420" style="s2">simply recognizing that there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.790" style="s2">something even if we can&#39;t be certain if</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.420" end="00:27:41.670" style="s2">we detect it that there is a state and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.790" end="00:27:44.790" style="s2">we can define it and that that state</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.670" end="00:27:47.100" style="s2">ought to distinguish between your</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.790" end="00:27:49.260" style="s2">viability and a conversation and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.100" end="00:27:51.930" style="s2">need to bar you from it so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.260" end="00:27:53.400" style="s2">loosely speaking good faith not as</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.930" end="00:27:57.240" style="s2">lawyers used to term because it has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:28:01.020" style="s2">very particular definition as a term of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.240" end="00:28:03.720" style="s2">art in the law but in common parlance I</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.020" end="00:28:07.640" style="s2">would say the the sin qua non of good</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.720" end="00:28:12.420" style="s2">faith is whether or not a person is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.640" end="00:28:14.160" style="s2">acting with reference to the goal that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.420" end="00:28:17.070" style="s2">they state in other words if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.160" end="00:28:20.460" style="s2">says this is my objective and then they</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.070" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">say something or take an action with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.460" end="00:28:23.550" style="s2">earnest belief that they are actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:25.170" style="s2">moving towards that objective that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.550" end="00:28:27.450" style="s2">good faith even if they&#39;re wrong even if</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.170" end="00:28:29.040" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is monstrous just the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.450" end="00:28:31.680" style="s2">simple fact that they are telling you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.040" end="00:28:34.350" style="s2">here&#39;s the objective and then the action</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.680" end="00:28:36.350" style="s2">matches the objective what people do</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.350" end="00:28:38.700" style="s2">that is not in good faith is they</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.350" end="00:28:41.340" style="s2">provide a misleading objective that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.700" end="00:28:44.580" style="s2">the easiest place to mislead and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.340" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">they pretend that their statements or</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.580" end="00:28:49.560" style="s2">their actions are actually an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:51.150" style="s2">reach that objective when really they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.560" end="00:28:55.410" style="s2">an attempt to reach some unstated</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.150" end="00:28:57.620" style="s2">objective so can you detect this yes you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.410" end="00:29:01.470" style="s2">can detect it can you do so absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.620" end="00:29:04.440" style="s2">reliably no but if you have enough data</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.470" end="00:29:07.580" style="s2">on a particular individuals behavior bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.440" end="00:29:10.530" style="s2">faith becomes evident over time because</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.580" end="00:29:12.990" style="s2">believing in X could not possibly result</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.530" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">in these statements and behaviors which</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.990" end="00:29:18.660" style="s2">are counterproductive with relevance</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:21.810" style="s2">with respect to the the objective so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.660" end="00:29:24.060" style="s2">know bad faith emerges can you detect</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.810" end="00:29:25.680" style="s2">bad faith suddenly can somebody do</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.060" end="00:29:27.270" style="s2">something that calls your attention to</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.680" end="00:29:28.980" style="s2">the likelihood that they&#39;re acting in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.270" end="00:29:31.590" style="s2">bad faith yep you can definitely see it</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.980" end="00:29:33.570" style="s2">could you be mistaken that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.590" end="00:29:34.950" style="s2">also but that will also become clear</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.570" end="00:29:41.220" style="s2">over time so what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.950" end="00:29:44.580" style="s2">somebody who is sensitive to tracking</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.220" end="00:29:47.250" style="s2">the match of a model to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.580" end="00:29:49.050" style="s2">manifest behavior can see these things</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.250" end="00:29:52.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually not unlike what we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.050" end="00:29:54.360" style="s2">in animal behavior animals non-human</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.050" end="00:29:56.250" style="s2">animals they never tell you what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.360" end="00:29:59.040" style="s2">up to right you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.250" end="00:30:00.930" style="s2">figure it out based on the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.040" end="00:30:02.520" style="s2">have a model this is what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.930" end="00:30:04.170" style="s2">animal is trying to accomplish and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.520" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">if I watch the animal continuing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.170" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">behave its behavior matches that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.610" style="s2">objective or here&#39;s what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.930" style="s2">happening and then no actually what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.610" end="00:30:14.100" style="s2">doing wouldn&#39;t make any sense if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.930" end="00:30:15.210" style="s2">what it was trying to accomplish so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.100" end="00:30:17.520" style="s2">must be trying to accomplish something</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.210" end="00:30:21.060" style="s2">different this is the same thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.520" end="00:30:23.430" style="s2">basically ethnology versus ethology so</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.060" end="00:30:25.140" style="s2">in this context I guess that the key</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.430" end="00:30:28.140" style="s2">distinctions we&#39;re making in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.140" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">conversation is are you oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.140" end="00:30:32.850" style="s2">truth or I Orin - winning winning the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.880" style="s2">interaction and making the other person</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.850" end="00:30:37.500" style="s2">look bad well I have that be a key</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.880" end="00:30:39.900" style="s2">distinction we haven&#39;t done I have no</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.500" end="00:30:42.420" style="s2">problem with somebody somebody is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.900" end="00:30:44.100" style="s2">inherently acting in bad faith if</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.420" end="00:30:45.300" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to win and make the other</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.100" end="00:30:46.350" style="s2">person look bad as long as they</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.300" end="00:30:49.020" style="s2">acknowledge that that&#39;s what they&#39;re up</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.350" end="00:30:50.760" style="s2">to right but if somebody says look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.020" end="00:30:52.410" style="s2">much more interested in discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.760" end="00:30:54.210" style="s2">truth than winning and then they behave</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.410" end="00:30:55.710" style="s2">like somebody who&#39;s more interests</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.210" end="00:30:57.690" style="s2">winning than discovering the truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.710" end="00:31:01.050" style="s2">that&#39;s bad faith it&#39;s the mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.690" end="00:31:03.990" style="s2">between the objective and the apparent</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.050" end="00:31:05.250" style="s2">objective and the stated objective so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.990" end="00:31:07.140" style="s2">don&#39;t really have any interest in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.250" end="00:31:09.990" style="s2">participating with somebody who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.140" end="00:31:11.400" style="s2">looking to score points but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.990" end="00:31:12.780" style="s2">challenge that they are acting in bad</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.400" end="00:31:14.160" style="s2">faith really depends on the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.780" end="00:31:14.730" style="s2">they don&#39;t admit that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.160" end="00:31:17.610" style="s2">they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.730" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">I guess the complexity for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.610" end="00:31:22.230" style="s2">very few people are actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.360" style="s2">people who think they&#39;re acting in good</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.230" end="00:31:25.830" style="s2">faith and get very upset if you say no</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.360" end="00:31:29.130" style="s2">you&#39;re about you&#39;re a bad faith actor</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.830" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">genuinely don&#39;t know or can&#39;t tell that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.130" end="00:31:31.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing like oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:33.900" style="s2">probably we could probably come up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.740" end="00:31:35.940" style="s2">two or three names of people who would</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.900" end="00:31:38.250" style="s2">be very very upset if you said you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.940" end="00:31:39.570" style="s2">actually a bad faith actor and genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.250" end="00:31:41.610" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.570" end="00:31:43.230" style="s2">actually trying to kind of approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.610" end="00:31:45.630" style="s2">truth and would argue that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.230" end="00:31:47.250" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to do so how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.630" end="00:31:50.280" style="s2">past this just being a subjective</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.250" end="00:31:53.280" style="s2">judgment by someone who maybe doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.280" end="00:31:55.530" style="s2">want to engage well first of all let us</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.280" end="00:31:57.660" style="s2">be clear I think a lot of people make</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.530" end="00:32:00.750" style="s2">the error that because they believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.660" end="00:32:02.490" style="s2">their motives to be positive that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:04.590" style="s2">is the same thing as acting in good</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.490" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">faith and the problem is it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.590" end="00:32:11.820" style="s2">to rationalize behaviors that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:14.940" style="s2">harmful to others and to paint some sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.820" end="00:32:16.650" style="s2">of positive spin on them so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:19.920" style="s2">question of whether your internal</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.650" end="00:32:21.780" style="s2">motives are decent that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.920" end="00:32:23.660" style="s2">question but there&#39;s too much room for</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.780" end="00:32:30.450" style="s2">rationalization for us to figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.660" end="00:32:34.070" style="s2">but really a mismatch between your</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.450" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">stated objective and the objective</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.070" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">revealed by your behaviors is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:48.180" style="s2">reason for a red flag this also means</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:51.540" style="s2">that you have an obligation to search</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.180" end="00:32:53.820" style="s2">your own mind to discover if in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.540" end="00:32:57.090" style="s2">there&#39;s a rationale for your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.820" end="00:32:58.830" style="s2">that you&#39;re not aware of or only dimly</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.090" end="00:33:01.710" style="s2">aware of and you&#39;re keeping it out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.830" end="00:33:03.870" style="s2">your own sight in order to prevent the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.710" end="00:33:04.890" style="s2">knowledge of it from causing you to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.870" end="00:33:06.900" style="s2">guilty of bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.890" end="00:33:09.720" style="s2">but a person who is willing to search</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.900" end="00:33:12.000" style="s2">their own mind and say look I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.720" end="00:33:13.620" style="s2">for sure I&#39;m a human being which means</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.000" end="00:33:15.240" style="s2">that most of what goes on in my head is</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.620" end="00:33:17.340" style="s2">invisible to me too</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.240" end="00:33:19.650" style="s2">but to the extent that I check my own</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.340" end="00:33:21.510" style="s2">motives it&#39;s not that I&#39;m privately</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.650" end="00:33:23.130" style="s2">aware of something and pursuing it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.510" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">not telling you about it as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.130" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">know what I&#39;m saying is my actual belief</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:31.140" style="s2">and it is based on the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:34.620" style="s2">told you it&#39;s based on now what we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.140" end="00:33:37.080" style="s2">with the difference between the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.620" end="00:33:38.910" style="s2">question does bad faith exist it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.080" end="00:33:41.340" style="s2">absolutely does does something else</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.910" end="00:33:44.580" style="s2">exist that we might call good faith it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.340" end="00:33:48.090" style="s2">absolutely does can you detect these</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.580" end="00:33:52.850" style="s2">things from the outside yes but it takes</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.090" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">a pattern right what do we do with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.850" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">accusation so we&#39;ve got the personal</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:03.990" style="s2">fact of acting and good or bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:06.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the suspicion by somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.990" end="00:34:07.800" style="s2">based on a pattern of behavior and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.090" end="00:34:08.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the accusation which might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.800" end="00:34:13.860" style="s2">used to keep somebody out of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.940" end="00:34:16.679" style="s2">discussion and the problem is we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.860" end="00:34:20.060" style="s2">convict somebody of bad faith unless</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.679" end="00:34:23.550" style="s2">there&#39;s really substantial evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.060" end="00:34:25.649" style="s2">they&#39;re stating an incorrect motive that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.550" end="00:34:27.600" style="s2">they have reason to know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.649" end="00:34:29.640" style="s2">what they are doing or if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.600" end="00:34:31.590" style="s2">know that they&#39;ve been avoiding it so as</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.640" end="00:34:35.010" style="s2">not to know right those are are the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.590" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">issues but we never have or almost never</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.010" end="00:34:42.179" style="s2">have the level of proof that would exist</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:44.310" style="s2">for convicting a person of a crime for</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.179" end="00:34:46.620" style="s2">example did you commit the crime the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.310" end="00:34:48.810" style="s2">evidence says beyond a reasonable doubt</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.620" end="00:34:50.070" style="s2">that you did right that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.810" end="00:34:52.440" style="s2">can prove but when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.070" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">your internal motivation it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.440" end="00:35:02.630" style="s2">harder to prove and so as a bar we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:02.630" style="s2">to understand that we are not really</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.870" end="00:35:10.500" style="s2">claiming the right to exclude somebody</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.030" end="00:35:13.290" style="s2">from a public good but in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.500" end="00:35:15.050" style="s2">I&#39;m not participating in a public good</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">participating in and the point is well I</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.330" end="00:35:32.180" style="s2">don&#39;t want to participate in that</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.240" end="00:36:08.060" style="s2">have the conversation with them and call</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.740" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">it out in real time and let the audience</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.060" end="00:36:13.820" style="s2">make out the nines how that can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:17.030" style="s2">useful but I would say there&#39;s a simple</p>

<p begin="00:36:35.150" end="00:36:41.240" style="s2">on how many hours there are left should</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.140" end="00:36:44.630" style="s2">I spend some of those hours engaging</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.240" end="00:36:49.990" style="s2">with people who are being deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.630" end="00:36:53.270" style="s2">about their own beliefs maybe maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.990" end="00:36:54.710" style="s2">well sure I would I&#39;d be willing to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.270" end="00:36:56.330" style="s2">that but then I wouldn&#39;t exactly bar</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.330" end="00:37:00.770" style="s2">was to expose their bad faith I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.460" end="00:37:02.870" style="s2">agree to participate in it so on rare</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.770" end="00:37:06.530" style="s2">occasion it may make sense to have those</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.870" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">conversations but in general the ability</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.530" end="00:37:11.660" style="s2">of a person acting in bad faith to snarl</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.940" style="s2">a conversation so that it goes nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">productive is much greater than the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.940" end="00:37:18.170" style="s2">ability of somebody acting in good faith</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.440" end="00:37:19.730" style="s2">to establish what&#39;s really going on in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.170" end="00:37:23.090" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s head or that there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.730" end="00:37:24.890" style="s2">charlatans or whatever so we should</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.090" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">spend our time where it&#39;s productive and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.890" end="00:37:30.319" style="s2">in general my experience tells me that</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:32.690" style="s2">interacting with people who are acting</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.319" end="00:37:35.959" style="s2">clear good faith is far more productive</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.690" end="00:37:38.900" style="s2">and I know that I know that from both</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.959" end="00:37:40.430" style="s2">you I know that both from your</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.900" end="00:37:42.469" style="s2">perspective I&#39;m from Eric&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.430" end="00:37:43.910" style="s2">I mean your background is evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.469" end="00:37:47.660" style="s2">biology Eric has got a background in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.910" end="00:37:49.579" style="s2">physics the IDW as a concept was</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.660" end="00:37:52.190" style="s2">actually a part of a much broader</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.579" end="00:37:54.019" style="s2">perspective of there are all of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.190" end="00:37:55.729" style="s2">now there are many narratives in society</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.019" end="00:37:57.829" style="s2">we&#39;re stuck on many different vectors</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.729" end="00:38:00.229" style="s2">and many different perspectives and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.829" end="00:38:02.029" style="s2">IDW was actually sort of the the public</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.229" end="00:38:04.239" style="s2">face of that conversation was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.029" end="00:38:06.589" style="s2">the media branch of that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.239" end="00:38:07.999" style="s2">and obviously quite an important part</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.589" end="00:38:10.699" style="s2">because it&#39;s the sort of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.999" end="00:38:14.119" style="s2">part that maybe then has a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.699" end="00:38:16.400" style="s2">all these different levels where do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.119" end="00:38:21.859" style="s2">feel that we&#39;re at in terms of shifting</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.400" end="00:38:24.489" style="s2">that broader conversation let me see if</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.859" end="00:38:30.650" style="s2">I understand what you&#39;re getting at</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.489" end="00:38:33.140" style="s2">there is a false narrative and a control</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.650" end="00:38:36.170" style="s2">over what gets discussed that manifests</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.140" end="00:38:38.930" style="s2">in various different places people may</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.170" end="00:38:40.789" style="s2">have seen my recent portal episode with</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.930" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">Eric in which we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.789" end="00:38:45.380" style="s2">question of telomeres senescence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:49.279" style="s2">cancer and in particular we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.380" end="00:38:51.469" style="s2">the issue of the evolution of long</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.279" end="00:38:54.049" style="s2">telomeres in laboratory mice which has</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.369" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">is clear it&#39;s been on the table for many</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.910" end="00:39:07.789" style="s2">years and as far as I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:12.319" style="s2">unaddressed by the field why I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.789" end="00:39:16.279" style="s2">know but the the pattern that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.319" end="00:39:19.569" style="s2">apparent is that every field has bodies</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.279" end="00:39:22.430" style="s2">buried under some set of floorboards and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.569" end="00:39:24.049" style="s2">deep insiders know where those things</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.430" end="00:39:27.140" style="s2">are and they do not get discussed in</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.049" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">public and the those of us on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.140" end="00:39:31.969" style="s2">outside suffer whatever consequences we</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:34.369" style="s2">do as a result of the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.969" end="00:39:38.660" style="s2">fields are not owning up to what they</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.369" end="00:39:41.390" style="s2">know IDW was a manifestation in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.660" end="00:39:42.290" style="s2">of a certain set of issues that were</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.390" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.290" end="00:39:51.590" style="s2">poorly discussed in the Academy and in</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">media space and it was composed of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.590" end="00:39:58.869" style="s2">people who were willing to pay the price</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:40:02.090" style="s2">to discuss what was really going on in</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.869" end="00:40:03.980" style="s2">these fields I don&#39;t think the fields in</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.090" end="00:40:06.170" style="s2">general have gotten any better but what</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.980" end="00:40:08.810" style="s2">has gotten better is that the awareness</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.170" end="00:40:11.540" style="s2">in the public that something seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.810" end="00:40:14.300" style="s2">wrong across the board that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.540" end="00:40:17.090" style="s2">mechanism we are using the way the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.300" end="00:40:19.250" style="s2">market plugs into our academic fields</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.090" end="00:40:22.490" style="s2">and our media environment and our courts</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.250" end="00:40:24.470" style="s2">is not resulting in a pretty good</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.470" end="00:40:28.700" style="s2">mostly depend which is what it pretends</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.420" end="00:40:31.010" style="s2">it&#39;s doing it&#39;s resulting in a really</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.570" end="00:40:44.359" style="s2">you have mobs of people challenging</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.650" end="00:40:47.210" style="s2">folks who are saying things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.359" end="00:40:52.130" style="s2">obviously have truth in them as if those</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.210" end="00:40:55.190" style="s2">people were speaking diabolical untruths</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.130" end="00:40:58.460" style="s2">that results in independent minded</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:12.260" style="s2">it right and so the the witch hunting</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.660" end="00:41:15.430" style="s2">that became common started to surface</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.260" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">people who in the face of a witch hunt</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.430" end="00:41:21.410" style="s2">would not back down</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.390" end="00:41:23.390" style="s2">and those people turned out to represent</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.670" end="00:41:59.749" style="s2">in two in particular in dialogues</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.719" end="00:42:15.380" style="s2">had a kind of very public implosion an</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.400" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">New Zealand and Australia also didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.930" end="00:42:58.219" style="s2">have tailed off almost completely after</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.420" end="00:43:00.019" style="s2">Pangburn failed how important do you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.219" end="00:43:04.569" style="s2">think that was to the trajectory of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.019" end="00:43:07.039" style="s2">of the IDW unfortunately I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.569" end="00:43:10.910" style="s2">tremendously important there was</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.039" end="00:43:12.769" style="s2">something that Pangburn was doing which</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.910" end="00:43:16.180" style="s2">was resulting in thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.769" end="00:43:19.099" style="s2">showing up in one place to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.180" end="00:43:21.619" style="s2">conversations that nobody knew what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.099" end="00:43:25.219" style="s2">outcome would be and that was very</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.619" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">healthy the way Pangburn explored that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.219" end="00:43:30.499" style="s2">space was very destructive because</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:32.900" style="s2">effectively and I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.499" end="00:43:37.219" style="s2">exactly what he was doing but he</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.900" end="00:43:42.709" style="s2">appeared to be gambling</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.219" end="00:43:45.380" style="s2">he would create events and then see if</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.709" end="00:43:48.140" style="s2">they filled and if they didn&#39;t he would</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.380" end="00:43:52.069" style="s2">cancel them and he would depend on</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:54.739" style="s2">future events to produce enough money to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.069" end="00:43:56.299" style="s2">create refunds and so there were some</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.739" end="00:43:58.279" style="s2">events that were cancelled that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.299" end="00:44:00.140" style="s2">did get refunds for and then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.279" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">point at which the business model</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.140" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">collapsed and refunds stopped coming</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.209" end="00:44:13.020" style="s2">that was very costly to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.120" end="00:44:16.350" style="s2">the IDW that the reputation of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.020" end="00:44:19.650" style="s2">space was jeopardized by that reckless</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.350" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">behavior and I resent it</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.650" end="00:44:31.500" style="s2">because it did have that impact with</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:37.340" style="s2">that said because Pangburn effectively</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.500" end="00:44:40.110" style="s2">showed how big the space was I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.340" end="00:44:44.040" style="s2">perplexed by the fact that something did</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.110" end="00:44:48.180" style="s2">not swoop in to pick up the ball he had</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.040" end="00:44:49.860" style="s2">dropped had that thing happened I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.180" end="00:44:51.300" style="s2">we would still be seeing interesting</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.860" end="00:44:53.970" style="s2">conversations and in fact what</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.300" end="00:44:56.550" style="s2">conversations we are seeing would</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.970" end="00:44:58.920" style="s2">probably have changed over time and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.550" end="00:45:00.630" style="s2">might be you know just as dynamic and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.920" end="00:45:06.090" style="s2">interesting and surprising today as they</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.630" end="00:45:08.190" style="s2">were a couple of years ago but that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.090" end="00:45:10.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen and there have certainly</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.190" end="00:45:13.590" style="s2">been some events since but you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.080" end="00:45:15.900" style="s2">the interest in what was going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.590" end="00:45:17.730" style="s2">space and who disagreed with whom and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.900" end="00:45:23.730" style="s2">where the state of their conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.730" end="00:45:26.040" style="s2">was that thing has been atomized and now</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.730" end="00:45:28.980" style="s2">exists in much smaller forms now that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.040" end="00:45:31.650" style="s2">said there are other things emerging in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.980" end="00:45:34.200" style="s2">the space Eric and I now have separate</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.650" end="00:45:36.600" style="s2">podcasts that have emerged in the space</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.200" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">and they definitely don&#39;t serve the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.600" end="00:45:43.230" style="s2">purpose as having you know a theater</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:47.070" style="s2">full of people there for a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.230" end="00:45:52.380" style="s2">between between IDW members but in any</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.070" end="00:45:54.560" style="s2">case my hope is that the momentum that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.380" end="00:45:57.210" style="s2">existed when those events were happening</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.560" end="00:45:58.710" style="s2">will be picked up by other things</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.210" end="00:46:01.230" style="s2">hopefully some of them will be events</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.710" end="00:46:07.710" style="s2">and some of them will take other forms</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.230" end="00:46:10.320" style="s2">and if things go well then our DW space</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.710" end="00:46:14.280" style="s2">will morph but it will it will continue</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.320" end="00:46:16.830" style="s2">and would you I mean as you say both you</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.280" end="00:46:19.110" style="s2">and Eric now have podcasts which i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.830" end="00:46:22.140" style="s2">is a really positive development because</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.110" end="00:46:25.410" style="s2">what I also saw from the initial</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.140" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">IDW formation was slight imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.410" end="00:46:31.410" style="s2">because your your your essentially then</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:33.059" style="s2">some some of those IDW members had ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.410" end="00:46:35.400" style="s2">to get their message out others had to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.059" end="00:46:37.019" style="s2">be mediated by other by the platforms</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.400" end="00:46:38.910" style="s2">do you think that was one sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.019" end="00:46:40.680" style="s2">failure condition for it as well the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.910" end="00:46:43.500" style="s2">fact that you were dependent on for</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.680" end="00:46:47.039" style="s2">example Ruben Rogan Sam Harris for</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.500" end="00:46:51.480" style="s2">actually getting the messages out I</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.039" end="00:46:53.819" style="s2">think I&#39;m not really sure I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.480" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">hard for me to see that as a negative</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.819" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">because in my case you know I end up on</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:05.670" style="s2">Rogen&#39;s program four times I was on Sam</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:09.210" style="s2">Harris&#39;s program Ruben&#39;s program three</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.670" end="00:47:12.799" style="s2">or four times in any case it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.210" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">impediment for me to get my message out</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.799" end="00:47:19.579" style="s2">because they were interested in having</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:22.890" style="s2">those conversations what has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.579" end="00:47:26.250" style="s2">now in order for the discussion to self</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.890" end="00:47:30.150" style="s2">catalyze I&#39;m not sure and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.250" end="00:47:32.519" style="s2">having more venues as potentially good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.150" end="00:47:34.529" style="s2">you know and it is also true that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.519" end="00:47:38.970" style="s2">venues that existed are morphing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.529" end="00:47:42.230" style="s2">changing and I&#39;m not sure what the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.970" end="00:47:45.329" style="s2">outgrowth of it what I would say is</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.230" end="00:47:49.349" style="s2">probably the most important thing is for</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.329" end="00:47:52.440" style="s2">the space to be dynamic that at any</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.349" end="00:47:56.279" style="s2">point that it becomes a thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.440" end="00:47:58.920" style="s2">continues to deliver the same sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.279" end="00:48:01.710" style="s2">value it will become boring and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.920" end="00:48:05.700" style="s2">that wouldn&#39;t be positive so I&#39;m hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.710" end="00:48:07.079" style="s2">that a dynamic phase two emerges what do</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.700" end="00:48:11.759" style="s2">you think like dynamic phase two looks</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.079" end="00:48:17.490" style="s2">like well I think one thing I hope to</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.759" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">see our events that focus more directly</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.490" end="00:48:23.759" style="s2">on not just the brokenness of our common</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:28.200" style="s2">narrative but on particular things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.759" end="00:48:31.890" style="s2">have failed in quadrants of our</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.200" end="00:48:33.300" style="s2">larger discussion so for example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.890" end="00:48:37.560" style="s2">going to be having a debate with david</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.300" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">sloan wilson very soon about group</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.560" end="00:48:41.460" style="s2">selection versus what i call lineage</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:45.120" style="s2">selection and the trouble with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.460" end="00:48:49.380" style="s2">event is that most people don&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.120" end="00:48:51.960" style="s2">how much rests on the outcome of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.380" end="00:48:53.670" style="s2">discussion it can seem kind of dry and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.960" end="00:48:57.780" style="s2">academic but when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.670" end="00:49:01.500" style="s2">what&#39;s really under discussion is why we</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.780" end="00:49:04.350" style="s2">behave in the collaborative way that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.500" end="00:49:06.150" style="s2">sometimes do and why that fails and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.350" end="00:49:08.760" style="s2">basically if you want to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.150" end="00:49:10.320" style="s2">civilization that achieves the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.760" end="00:49:12.810" style="s2">objectives that a highly collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.320" end="00:49:14.520" style="s2">civilization might then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.810" end="00:49:16.500" style="s2">understand what it is that the driving</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.520" end="00:49:19.590" style="s2">force behind that collaboration is based</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.500" end="00:49:24.450" style="s2">on because it&#39;s a key feature of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.590" end="00:49:25.950" style="s2">architecture so in any case i&#39;m hoping</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.450" end="00:49:28.140" style="s2">that more discussions like that will</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.950" end="00:49:31.050" style="s2">happen where we confront a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.140" end="00:49:33.720" style="s2">issue on which a great many a great</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.050" end="00:49:36.240" style="s2">breadth of things depends and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.720" end="00:49:37.800" style="s2">people will begin to realize that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:41.120" style="s2">that&#39;s where the rubber meets the road</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.800" end="00:49:43.770" style="s2">it&#39;s all well and good to find heterodox</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.120" end="00:49:45.780" style="s2">thinkers who are bold enough to speak in</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.770" end="00:49:48.780" style="s2">public it&#39;s another thing entirely to</p>
