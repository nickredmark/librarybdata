<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">Eric Weinstein and today I&#39;m here with</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.340" end="00:00:17.580" style="s2">University of Chicago professor of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">philosophy dr. Agnes : hi Agnes welcome</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.580" end="00:00:25.080" style="s2">thank you I want to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:26.820" style="s2">everything do you mind yeah okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.080" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">just had an interesting and bizarre game</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.820" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t know that you were coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">out to Southern California and you said</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">to me that after a meeting we had at in</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:39.840" style="s2">your office at the University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">hey you should take a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.840" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">article I wrote partially based on our</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">meeting and the meet the the article is</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">one about negotiating initial meetings</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">and what are all of the layers of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">dynamics that are going on when two</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">people collide for the first time yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:00.030" style="s2">think that when two people collide for</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">the first time I guess there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.030" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">two things at the base level that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:05.700" style="s2">happening one of them is like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">trying to figure out how to get along</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.700" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">how to cooperate and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to take the measure of</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:13.369" style="s2">one another and those activities aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">totally separate from one another and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.369" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed a pattern with you which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:22.380" style="s2">that you take great delight in talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">about the things that many of us do sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.380" end="00:01:29.610" style="s2">of naturally or unconsciously and might</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:31.860" style="s2">be very uncomfortable to promote to full</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.610" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">consciousness so that you can use your</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.860" end="00:01:36.780" style="s2">metacognitive facility to interrogate</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">and dissect what is going on on many</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.780" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">many different levels</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">some of them fill out the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:45.710" style="s2">some of them rooted in biology some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:49.890" style="s2">them maybe with allusions to literature</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.710" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">when you and I met were you aware of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.890" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">what you were going through in real time</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:59.390" style="s2">or did it come to you later that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">was gonna be grist for an article</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.390" end="00:02:02.909" style="s2">totally later I was my mind was</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:05.100" style="s2">completely on another article I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.909" end="00:02:07.469" style="s2">working on so you were concentrated when</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.100" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">we were when we were meeting on our</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.469" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">meeting no not really</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:12.950" style="s2">I mean I mean I think that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:17.269" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.950" end="00:02:19.879" style="s2">love that um you know I feel like um a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.269" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">lot of the thinking that I do is like</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.879" end="00:02:23.480" style="s2">unpacking thinking I did earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.489" style="s2">wasn&#39;t realizing I was doing or</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.480" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">something like that so like it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.489" end="00:02:29.090" style="s2">with this language when you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">I and you&#39;re actually realizing that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.090" end="00:02:33.019" style="s2">have so many different processes right</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:36.260" style="s2">yeah okay keep going</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.019" end="00:02:39.950" style="s2">but I guess maybe one common threat I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.260" end="00:02:41.989" style="s2">like to yeah maybe I have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.950" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">affinity towards like the provocative or</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.989" end="00:02:46.060" style="s2">something but it may be at a at a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:48.470" style="s2">level I think that there&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.060" end="00:02:50.870" style="s2">when we talk about ourselves when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.470" end="00:02:54.579" style="s2">think about our lives there are all</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.870" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">these sort of cracks in the facade of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.579" end="00:02:58.430" style="s2">like who we take ourselves to be and how</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">we represent ourselves and but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.430" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">is that like we&#39;ve kind of convinced</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:03.620" style="s2">ourselves that the cracks are parts of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">the design cuz we&#39;ve been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.620" end="00:03:06.920" style="s2">them for so long right look what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">pretty pattern and I just want to split</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.920" end="00:03:10.640" style="s2">those cracks open and be like look</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:12.470" style="s2">there&#39;s something incoherent in the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.640" end="00:03:15.079" style="s2">that we think about ourselves and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.470" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">covered that in coherence over with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.079" end="00:03:18.769" style="s2">certain kind of language and just a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.970" end="00:03:20.480" style="s2">of the time those cracks are to be found</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.769" end="00:03:22.010" style="s2">exactly in the places that you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.480" end="00:03:23.660" style="s2">call maybe provocative or something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.010" end="00:03:25.010" style="s2">that but sometimes they&#39;re not and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.660" end="00:03:27.260" style="s2">interested in them in those places too</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.010" end="00:03:28.639" style="s2">it&#39;s just other people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.260" end="00:03:31.130" style="s2">philosophers are less interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.639" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">nursing cracks right so I wrote my</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.130" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">dissertation on weakness of will where I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:37.910" style="s2">think that there&#39;s something because</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:39.290" style="s2">will like Ulysses lashing himself to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.910" end="00:03:40.850" style="s2">mast well that would be a case of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.290" end="00:03:42.230" style="s2">strength of well right but yes he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.850" end="00:03:43.639" style="s2">responding to the prospect of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.230" end="00:03:46.760" style="s2">possibility of weakness so he&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.639" end="00:03:49.160" style="s2">his agency ahead of time with a strong</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.760" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">will so that he can actually go through</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.160" end="00:03:53.420" style="s2">an adaptive Ally of weak will that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:55.040" style="s2">anticipates correctly he&#39;s yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.420" end="00:03:57.170" style="s2">sort of turning a synchronic problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.040" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">into a diachronic problem right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.170" end="00:04:00.170" style="s2">giving the diachronic solution to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:01.730" style="s2">synchronic problem but like so which I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.170" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">could do say if I know that I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.730" end="00:04:05.959" style="s2">susceptible to certain forms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.160" style="s2">temptation I could in advance make sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.959" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">that I don&#39;t encounter those forms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.160" end="00:04:11.389" style="s2">temptation right so what Ulysses is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:13.489" style="s2">Odysseus is doing um but I&#39;m just I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.389" end="00:04:16.070" style="s2">very interested in just how we described</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.489" end="00:04:17.539" style="s2">a situation in which we say I know I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.070" end="00:04:19.729" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have another cookie but I take</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.539" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">one anyway um it&#39;s totally familiar</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.729" end="00:04:22.789" style="s2">we&#39;re totally comfortable talking in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">that way I think it&#39;s an incoherent way</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.789" end="00:04:26.690" style="s2">of talking so that&#39;s an exact where</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:29.230" style="s2">where that&#39;s an example where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.690" end="00:04:31.850" style="s2">provocative it&#39;s not country like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.230" end="00:04:34.100" style="s2">controversial in the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.850" end="00:04:36.620" style="s2">sensitive topic but it&#39;s just a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.100" end="00:04:39.470" style="s2">where our speech about ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.620" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">cracked and incoherent but we just have</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.470" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">done it for so long that we don&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.060" end="00:04:46.370" style="s2">it only because the cookie isn&#39;t a three</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:48.140" style="s2">simmer a pile of cocaine no I think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.370" end="00:04:49.910" style="s2">would be justice incoherent in those</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.140" end="00:04:51.530" style="s2">cases if you could say to yourself it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.910" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">would be provocative oh yes absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.530" end="00:04:57.560" style="s2">right the issue of provocation doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.630" style="s2">have to do with the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">universality class of the problem it has</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.630" end="00:05:03.350" style="s2">to do simply with its particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:06.260" style="s2">instantiation correct though I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.350" end="00:05:08.060" style="s2">that there are problems where even um</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.260" end="00:05:11.450" style="s2">like they&#39;re the correct level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.060" end="00:05:12.890" style="s2">abstraction is to abstract from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.450" end="00:05:14.510" style="s2">difference between cookies or cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.890" end="00:05:15.470" style="s2">cookies and cocaine because that</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.510" end="00:05:16.970" style="s2">difference isn&#39;t philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.470" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">interesting but there are some problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.970" end="00:05:20.900" style="s2">where the correct level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:22.010" style="s2">is the provocative level right so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.900" end="00:05:24.430" style="s2">think the status one it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.010" end="00:05:28.610" style="s2">provocative level say more about that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.430" end="00:05:31.640" style="s2">think that I guess I think it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.610" end="00:05:34.760" style="s2">case that I&#39;m the problem that I raised</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.640" end="00:05:37.040" style="s2">there about status about you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.760" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">wanting on some level to be worth more</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.040" end="00:05:40.580" style="s2">than other people but then also</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:42.169" style="s2">recognizing that that desire is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.580" end="00:05:44.810" style="s2">not one that you can ask another person</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.169" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">to recognize right that problem isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.810" end="00:05:49.160" style="s2">some instance of a more general problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:51.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t see it as an instance of a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.160" end="00:05:52.340" style="s2">general problem where the solution would</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.020" end="00:05:54.020" style="s2">lie that abstract level I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.340" end="00:05:59.540" style="s2">the correct level at which to address it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.020" end="00:06:01.190" style="s2">why do you imagine that why do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.540" end="00:06:03.110" style="s2">imagine that status you saw in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.190" end="00:06:05.660" style="s2">article you say that the status game is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.110" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">one in which you can&#39;t really discuss</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.660" end="00:06:11.720" style="s2">your desire a need for status yeah is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">that true it&#39;s not it&#39;s not true in all</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.720" end="00:06:16.610" style="s2">contexts like I could I got you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">wrote a column about it so obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.610" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">can discuss it and I can just cussing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:24.569" style="s2">with you right now but there&#39;s this</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.290" end="00:06:32.390" style="s2">there would be something wrong like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.660" end="00:06:35.810" style="s2">know I had this interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.390" end="00:06:39.110" style="s2">somebody who I felt was asking me to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.810" end="00:06:40.580" style="s2">acknowledge their status recently and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.110" end="00:06:42.530" style="s2">had this instinct to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.580" end="00:06:44.150" style="s2">I would like to acknowledge your status</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.530" end="00:06:45.979" style="s2">you&#39;re more important than me now can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.150" end="00:06:47.210" style="s2">just go on and I couldn&#39;t do that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.979" end="00:06:48.229" style="s2">wasn&#39;t allowed I knew that was not</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.210" end="00:06:51.259" style="s2">allowed within the game that would&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.229" end="00:06:52.909" style="s2">been offensive right so it&#39;s a rule of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.259" end="00:06:55.580" style="s2">the game that you have to pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.909" end="00:06:58.159" style="s2">you&#39;re not playing it but um you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.580" end="00:07:00.139" style="s2">then sort of like take a step back right</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.159" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">and then be like oh let&#39;s analyse do</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.139" end="00:07:04.189" style="s2">that and I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t always do</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.930" style="s2">it but you can sometimes do it but</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.189" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">that&#39;s not this that&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.930" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">putting the game on pause and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:11.360" style="s2">stepping back and analyzing what was</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.129" style="s2">happening so in other words you have the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.360" end="00:07:14.990" style="s2">game in a debugger and you&#39;re stepping</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.129" end="00:07:16.940" style="s2">through line lines of the code in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.990" end="00:07:21.080" style="s2">different facility than that which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.940" end="00:07:26.050" style="s2">actually running the code yes okay so if</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.080" end="00:07:28.669" style="s2">that&#39;s the case why is there a feud</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.050" end="00:07:31.460" style="s2">there&#39;s no guarantee that you won&#39;t then</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.669" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">be reprising the game at the second</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.460" end="00:07:36.379" style="s2">level well so that&#39;s the issue which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:39.080" style="s2">that each layer of analysis that you put</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.379" end="00:07:41.240" style="s2">on it becomes non meta relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.080" end="00:07:43.400" style="s2">following level of meta analysis that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:45.500" style="s2">includes that layer and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.400" end="00:07:47.210" style="s2">question of convergence in essence where</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.500" end="00:07:49.849" style="s2">you have an initial game then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.210" end="00:07:53.960" style="s2">meta game so your article is ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.849" end="00:07:55.610" style="s2">in the second level of that game but</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.960" end="00:07:58.969" style="s2">then effectively what you did was you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.610" end="00:08:00.949" style="s2">communicated to me whatever status game</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.969" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">you and I negotiated in your office I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.949" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">have a different status game which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:08.659" style="s2">that I have access to a alerted journal</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:11.210" style="s2">in which I can write articles I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.659" end="00:08:13.940" style="s2">thoughtyou important enough to write an</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.210" end="00:08:16.509" style="s2">article in part inspired by our meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.940" end="00:08:18.650" style="s2">and then I am communicating that I too</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.509" end="00:08:20.629" style="s2">you know have levers that may not be</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.650" end="00:08:21.979" style="s2">available to you and I wish to let you</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.629" end="00:08:25.159" style="s2">know that you are both important enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.979" end="00:08:26.539" style="s2">to warrant this thinking simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.159" end="00:08:28.099" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you got away with</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.539" end="00:08:29.389" style="s2">something because in fact I can see</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.099" end="00:08:31.550" style="s2">things awesome</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.389" end="00:08:33.169" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s right so I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.550" end="00:08:34.430" style="s2">what that reveals is like I so notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.169" end="00:08:38.329" style="s2">you use in a couple of your practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.430" end="00:08:41.269" style="s2">where metacognitive and I think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.329" end="00:08:43.699" style="s2">much more of a skeptic about how much</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.269" end="00:08:46.190" style="s2">work the meta can do at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.699" end="00:08:48.949" style="s2">immediately for exactly this reason I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.190" end="00:08:50.209" style="s2">think that like like when you step back</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.949" end="00:08:51.949" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter what you&#39;re stepping</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.209" end="00:08:53.300" style="s2">back from okay you like you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.949" end="00:08:53.560" style="s2">situation you let me step back and think</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.300" end="00:08:55.629" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.560" end="00:08:57.459" style="s2">let me step back and cool my you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.629" end="00:08:58.779" style="s2">from my emotions let me step back you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.459" end="00:08:59.949" style="s2">never stepping back you&#39;re always just</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.779" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">the same person you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.949" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">it&#39;s an illusion to think you can step</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:05.800" style="s2">back um but I think what what does</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:07.449" style="s2">happen when you step back is like</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.800" end="00:09:10.569" style="s2">stepping back happens at least a moment</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.449" end="00:09:12.579" style="s2">later then I don&#39;t think so in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.569" end="00:09:15.790" style="s2">sense because really what eyes the way I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.579" end="00:09:19.990" style="s2">see it I&#39;m eager to hear I&#39;m wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.790" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">your eyes is that what we just did is we</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.990" end="00:09:24.220" style="s2">had a zero with later which is our</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:25.959" style="s2">initial meeting then we had the issue</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.220" end="00:09:27.699" style="s2">where you wish to notify me that you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.959" end="00:09:29.379" style="s2">written an article partially inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.699" end="00:09:32.259" style="s2">this and then I wish to bring this up on</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.379" end="00:09:33.759" style="s2">the podcast which is the next layer and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.259" end="00:09:36.220" style="s2">then we can talk about the fact that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.759" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">just and my point in doing this is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.220" end="00:09:42.370" style="s2">we build an infinite Tower of analyses</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:45.249" style="s2">of the previous level analysis so meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.370" end="00:09:48.129" style="s2">is not a different facility but simply</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.249" end="00:09:50.769" style="s2">the recognition that layer I plus one is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.129" end="00:09:52.300" style="s2">commenting on layer high right but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.769" end="00:09:54.249" style="s2">thing that that the metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.300" end="00:09:56.050" style="s2">tower the problem of it is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.249" end="00:09:59.139" style="s2">synchronic and so I think that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:10:02.559" style="s2">changed between our initial meeting okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.139" end="00:10:04.269" style="s2">and like the writing that article it</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.559" end="00:10:06.069" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like I just sat down and wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.269" end="00:10:07.779" style="s2">I had to think really hard about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.069" end="00:10:10.660" style="s2">meeting I had an initial version that</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.779" end="00:10:13.000" style="s2">was totally scrapped I learned in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.660" end="00:10:15.610" style="s2">between our meeting and writing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.000" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">article and I&#39;ve even learned in between</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.610" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">like you know talking about it with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:21.069" style="s2">and now right so I&#39;m like a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">person you&#39;re talking to a different</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.069" end="00:10:25.300" style="s2">person than you were talking to when we</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:29.410" style="s2">first met in one sense in one sense yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.300" end="00:10:31.480" style="s2">in the sense that I&#39;ve it&#39;s not a tower</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.410" end="00:10:38.050" style="s2">like I&#39;ve sort of incorporated some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.480" end="00:10:41.410" style="s2">the lessons from that interaction so and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.050" end="00:10:43.059" style="s2">I think one thing is like you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.410" end="00:10:46.329" style="s2">a little bit like I remember there were</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.059" end="00:10:50.050" style="s2">these when my son&#39;s preschool when he</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.329" end="00:10:53.559" style="s2">first started there were these charts</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.050" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">that were like diagrams of how kids move</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.559" end="00:10:57.550" style="s2">around a room in like a put so he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:58.870" style="s2">two or three years old right like so it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.550" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">was like this line like first they go to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.870" end="00:11:02.470" style="s2">the sandbox then they go to the block</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:05.309" style="s2">some night right so what was amazing is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.470" end="00:11:07.030" style="s2">you look at the lines for like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.309" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">three-year-old yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.030" end="00:11:10.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s like just this like Scrabble</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:12.250" style="s2">Scrabble they randomly wander around and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.330" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">then and you then they had these</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.250" end="00:11:15.490" style="s2">diagrams for like the five you know not</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:16.780" style="s2">even know I think it would be like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.490" end="00:11:19.300" style="s2">couple months later towards the end of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.780" end="00:11:20.530" style="s2">the year of the same so they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.300" end="00:11:21.850" style="s2">age where they&#39;re like a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.530" end="00:11:25.390" style="s2">older and they&#39;re like much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.850" end="00:11:27.540" style="s2">organized right so I see that as</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.390" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">happening with conversation with you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.540" end="00:11:33.070" style="s2">where part of what&#39;s happening is like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.690" style="s2">learning to focus right and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.070" end="00:11:38.410" style="s2">really well captured I think with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.690" end="00:11:43.060" style="s2">idea of a meta level not sure that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.410" end="00:11:45.670" style="s2">understood that well um V so can we talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.060" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">a little bit about the particular status</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.670" end="00:11:50.680" style="s2">game and our subsequent interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">of what it meant okay so it was very</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.680" end="00:11:53.710" style="s2">interesting when I was just talking to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:55.630" style="s2">before the show you talked to me about</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.710" end="00:11:57.250" style="s2">saying I&#39;m not even sure that status is</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.630" end="00:11:59.440" style="s2">exactly the right word for what we were</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.250" end="00:12:01.240" style="s2">negotiating and that was an intuition</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.440" end="00:12:05.350" style="s2">where I hadn&#39;t grounded yet in language</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.240" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s in some sort of more primitive kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.350" end="00:12:11.980" style="s2">of intangible state and I had forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">exactly what the issue was but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.980" end="00:12:15.670" style="s2">you&#39;d note you&#39;d known very little about</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:18.610" style="s2">me I think Tyler Cowen had maybe alerted</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.670" end="00:12:20.020" style="s2">you to me yes and that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.610" end="00:12:23.020" style="s2">particularly surprising I mean I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.020" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">don&#39;t expect people to know who I am but</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.020" end="00:12:28.630" style="s2">what little you did know about me was</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:32.110" style="s2">that somehow I was part of a money</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.630" end="00:12:35.050" style="s2">machine as a managing director of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.110" end="00:12:37.390" style="s2">family office and that that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.050" end="00:12:39.010" style="s2">be kind of the expansion point that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.390" end="00:12:40.630" style="s2">was going to be like the 0with</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.010" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">approximation and then we&#39;d add first</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.630" end="00:12:43.510" style="s2">and second and third order</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:45.630" style="s2">approximations based on that expansion</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.510" end="00:12:48.910" style="s2">point bank which drove me nuts</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.630" end="00:12:50.920" style="s2">right because that would never be the</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.910" end="00:12:53.020" style="s2">expansion point that I would choose for</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.920" end="00:12:54.340" style="s2">myself nor do I think it is the correct</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.020" end="00:12:57.780" style="s2">one and then we had some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.340" end="00:13:00.730" style="s2">other issues if I yeah which is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.780" end="00:13:02.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard a great deal about you more</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.730" end="00:13:06.400" style="s2">than I&#39;ve read of your thinking and work</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.650" end="00:13:08.830" style="s2">and many people that I like regard you</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.400" end="00:13:11.380" style="s2">highly and I thought okay well this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.830" end="00:13:12.820" style="s2">likely to be a singular person and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.380" end="00:13:17.050" style="s2">would be a shame to lose a singular</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.820" end="00:13:18.820" style="s2">person based on a wrong expansion point</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.050" end="00:13:20.740" style="s2">in a conversation so there was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.820" end="00:13:23.140" style="s2">an emergency need</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.740" end="00:13:27.160" style="s2">to rebase the the conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.140" end="00:13:28.840" style="s2">other around a more fruitful point so as</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.160" end="00:13:31.570" style="s2">not to lose a potentially interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.840" end="00:13:32.860" style="s2">interaction and then when I communicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.570" end="00:13:35.650" style="s2">this to you you and I both share an</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.860" end="00:13:38.290" style="s2">aversion to talking about the world of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.650" end="00:13:39.640" style="s2">exceptional people which often the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.290" end="00:13:41.290" style="s2">members of the world of exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">people constantly regard themselves then</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.290" end="00:13:44.980" style="s2">and the other is exceptional in a kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2">of self congratulatory display so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.980" end="00:13:50.830" style="s2">whole thing kind of descends into an</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.660" end="00:13:54.370" style="s2">orgy of analysis on analysis on analysis</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.830" end="00:13:57.490" style="s2">and I wonder why we&#39;re not just more</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.370" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">capable of doing this more simply like</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.490" end="00:14:01.870" style="s2">hey I&#39;m worried you&#39;re forming an</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:07.330" style="s2">incorrect impression of me or I need</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.870" end="00:14:09.850" style="s2">some acknowledgement from you that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.330" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">is an issue of accomplishment or you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.850" end="00:14:12.850" style="s2">know so that you don&#39;t start lecturing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:17.140" style="s2">me about basic mathematics if I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.850" end="00:14:19.390" style="s2">mathematician let&#39;s say right so first</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.140" end="00:14:20.980" style="s2">of all like I think I actually do think</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.390" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">this is probably a sort of a difference</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.980" end="00:14:25.300" style="s2">between us in that suppose that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:26.830" style="s2">thought you knew me as just all that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.300" end="00:14:28.770" style="s2">knew about me was that I was a mother or</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.830" end="00:14:32.380" style="s2">something okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.770" end="00:14:33.700" style="s2">like I&#39;m not sure like I guess what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.380" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">thought you knew about me was that I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.700" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">like an academic or something and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.690" style="s2">not sure that that would have mattered</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:47.500" style="s2">to me like which of those you had picked</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.690" end="00:14:49.810" style="s2">but um so so so but in terms of why we</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.500" end="00:14:52.390" style="s2">can&#39;t just directly ask for this I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.810" end="00:14:55.000" style="s2">we could have if like we were like</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.390" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">teenagers or something but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.000" end="00:15:00.190" style="s2">learned not to do it like we learned we</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:02.470" style="s2">learned how to interact with people</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.190" end="00:15:05.020" style="s2">right and that&#39;s a rule and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:07.060" style="s2">both following the rule somewhat I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.020" end="00:15:10.420" style="s2">I think there&#39;s also this problem maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.060" end="00:15:13.060" style="s2">I&#39;ll pose it to you why truth doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.420" end="00:15:16.300" style="s2">work like I&#39;m not a huge fan of truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.060" end="00:15:16.930" style="s2">the way some people are and I&#39;m a huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.300" end="00:15:19.630" style="s2">fan of truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.930" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">oh that&#39;s beautiful so I posed them the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.630" end="00:15:24.850" style="s2">problem of if I have only mildly bad</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:27.880" style="s2">breath and you wish to let me know that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.850" end="00:15:29.770" style="s2">for my own benefit what&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.880" end="00:15:31.030" style="s2">you could communicate to me that I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.770" end="00:15:34.300" style="s2">mildly bad breath and I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.030" end="00:15:36.830" style="s2">never met anyone who solved this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.300" end="00:15:38.660" style="s2">so you should try the zero with order</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.830" end="00:15:40.850" style="s2">first and we&#39;ll see why it gets into</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:42.830" style="s2">trouble right so that would just be</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.850" end="00:15:44.750" style="s2">saying you have mildly bad breath right</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.830" end="00:15:47.690" style="s2">now because of the context of that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.750" end="00:15:48.260" style="s2">interpretation of that statement is my</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.690" end="00:15:50.600" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.260" end="00:15:52.220" style="s2">is such a taboo to talk about someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.600" end="00:15:53.870" style="s2">breath must be hard that it must be</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.220" end="00:15:55.070" style="s2">horrible for you to say that it is mild</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.870" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">and so what you&#39;ve done is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.070" end="00:15:59.090" style="s2">communicated an untruth even though you</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.110" end="00:16:01.760" style="s2">intended so then you start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.090" end="00:16:04.040" style="s2">about the problem of like your eyeball</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.760" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">is distorted so you need a second</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:08.060" style="s2">distortion and this in this case your</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.850" style="s2">spectacles so that the aggregate of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.060" end="00:16:11.750" style="s2">two is undistorted can I give my answer</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.850" end="00:16:13.610" style="s2">yeah please</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.750" end="00:16:16.460" style="s2">I think you&#39;re the philosopher it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.610" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">be awesome I think I would be like oh my</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.460" end="00:16:20.660" style="s2">god I can&#39;t believe this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">happening because this one time I talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.660" end="00:16:25.760" style="s2">to Erica Weinstein and he posed this as</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:27.020" style="s2">a problem what do you do what do you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.760" end="00:16:28.190" style="s2">tell someone when they have mildly bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.020" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">breath and now I&#39;m in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.190" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what I would say to the person do</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:36.770" style="s2">you think it gets read that way I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.900" style="s2">no idea I mean I&#39;m giving you an answer</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.770" end="00:16:41.060" style="s2">in the abstract no acting from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.900" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">person right I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.060" end="00:16:45.290" style="s2">make the point that my point is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:46.340" style="s2">would be a cool wait like I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.290" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">that just because I would be curious</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.340" end="00:16:49.850" style="s2">what&#39;s how the person&#39;s are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:51.200" style="s2">respond so like there&#39;s a question how</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.850" end="00:16:53.030" style="s2">do you how do you do this what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:56.510" style="s2">successful interaction right for me</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.030" end="00:16:58.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a promising response</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.510" end="00:17:00.080" style="s2">because it might generate an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.760" end="00:17:02.030" style="s2">conversation it will generate an</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.080" end="00:17:04.910" style="s2">interesting conversation the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.030" end="00:17:07.100" style="s2">though is to my way of thinking that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.910" end="00:17:09.230" style="s2">have to give up on truthful</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.100" end="00:17:11.570" style="s2">communication because of its</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.230" end="00:17:13.550" style="s2">impossibility in order to start seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.570" end="00:17:16.490" style="s2">what is possible but where truth is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.550" end="00:17:20.630" style="s2">component in an interest but it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.490" end="00:17:22.790" style="s2">a goal in other words if I say you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.630" end="00:17:25.480" style="s2">what is the fractional representation of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.790" end="00:17:27.560" style="s2">Pi doesn&#39;t mean you can can&#39;t come close</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.480" end="00:17:29.450" style="s2">but you can never going to get there</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.560" end="00:17:32.810" style="s2">with two integers dividing one by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.450" end="00:17:34.280" style="s2">other so my claim is is that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.810" end="00:17:38.990" style="s2">important to give up on the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.280" end="00:17:40.850" style="s2">of truth from the from the get-go so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.990" end="00:17:43.790" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem right to me so um I</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.850" end="00:17:46.270" style="s2">mean one thing is it may be that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.790" end="00:17:48.430" style="s2">cannot immediately communicate</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.270" end="00:17:50.020" style="s2">to you the truth I think was I learn you</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.430" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">that I then I will realize that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.020" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">speaking in the undistorted fashion you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:18:00.060" style="s2">believe no um I think that um one thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:18:03.010" style="s2">that happens is that people they learn</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.060" end="00:18:04.300" style="s2">like a new shared language like they</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.010" end="00:18:09.580" style="s2">learn how to communicate with one</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.300" end="00:18:13.930" style="s2">another right and they become better at</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.580" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">doing that and it may be that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.930" end="00:18:18.280" style="s2">to me that the goal of that process is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.940" end="00:18:19.570" style="s2">always to communicate better and more</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.740" end="00:21:06.840" style="s2">think anytime you divide things and like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.050" end="00:21:08.580" style="s2">philosophers disagree about this um like</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.840" end="00:21:09.540" style="s2">some philosophers are fine with a sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.580" end="00:21:10.950" style="s2">of thing I&#39;m about to describe but like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.540" end="00:21:12.210" style="s2">I think you can&#39;t just divide things</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.950" end="00:21:13.830" style="s2">into four things you&#39;re like here are</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.210" end="00:21:15.270" style="s2">the four things these are the things I</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.830" end="00:21:16.440" style="s2">found I&#39;m like well what&#39;s the principle</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.270" end="00:21:18.059" style="s2">of division like is that just something</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.440" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">you made up like what if we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.059" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">a fifth one so I want to understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:25.740" style="s2">amenable to I want to understand sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:27.990" style="s2">how the whole is articulated into those</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.740" end="00:21:29.490" style="s2">things until I understand that I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.990" end="00:21:32.820" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve I&#39;ve understood</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.490" end="00:21:33.420" style="s2">anything I&#39;m like why not okay why not</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.820" end="00:21:35.690" style="s2">pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.420" end="00:21:38.940" style="s2">why isn&#39;t pleasure one of them enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.690" end="00:21:40.800" style="s2">well in part that is part of meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.940" end="00:21:42.179" style="s2">it&#39;s also part of grace as long as the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.800" end="00:21:44.760" style="s2">the proximate of pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.179" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">see pleasure arises in my concept</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.760" end="00:21:50.010" style="s2">concept as the as proximate to fitness</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:52.170" style="s2">so the way in which that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.010" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">structured as animals is that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.170" end="00:21:58.070" style="s2">ultimate concerns like nutrition and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.550" end="00:22:05.730" style="s2">consolidation of long-term memory are</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.030" end="00:22:09.050" style="s2">encoded as hunger and sleepiness and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.730" end="00:22:11.330" style="s2">the proximate cause us to take actions</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.050" end="00:22:13.550" style="s2">to service the ultimates so pleasures</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.330" end="00:22:16.130" style="s2">that is in some sense the divorcing of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.550" end="00:22:18.980" style="s2">the proximate sfrom their ultimate goals</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.130" end="00:22:21.020" style="s2">I just ate a cupcake and I really</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.980" end="00:22:22.970" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have but the proximate</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.020" end="00:22:25.460" style="s2">pleasure because my body thinks that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.970" end="00:22:29.840" style="s2">starved for sugar when in our current</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.460" end="00:22:31.540" style="s2">environment it&#39;s abundant so I you just</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.840" end="00:22:33.560" style="s2">gave an argument that suggested that</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.540" end="00:22:35.390" style="s2">pleasure does not fit into fitness</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.560" end="00:22:38.060" style="s2">because the proximate pleasures can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.390" end="00:22:40.790" style="s2">divorced from its ultimate goals right</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.060" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">so at least some people might think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.790" end="00:22:45.320" style="s2">would warrant putting pleasure into its</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:46.940" style="s2">own into a separate category but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.320" end="00:22:47.930" style="s2">want it right but what I&#39;m saying is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.940" end="00:22:49.310" style="s2">fact that you don&#39;t want to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.930" end="00:22:50.930" style="s2">indicates that for some reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.310" end="00:22:54.220" style="s2">wedded to this quadripartite division</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.930" end="00:22:58.070" style="s2">that which is not to say quadripartite</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.220" end="00:22:59.180" style="s2">yes I&#39;ve never said that um but so let</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.070" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">me let me tell you how I would divide</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.180" end="00:23:03.170" style="s2">okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:04.910" style="s2">so I would start with thinking okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.170" end="00:23:06.440" style="s2">there&#39;s thinking right anytime you do</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.910" end="00:23:08.480" style="s2">and I think conversation is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.440" end="00:23:11.420" style="s2">thinking in fact a lot of times it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.480" end="00:23:13.670" style="s2">best form of thinking and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.420" end="00:23:15.800" style="s2">anything he has to have a goal well</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.670" end="00:23:17.180" style="s2">there&#39;s an exception but okay the main</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.800" end="00:23:18.380" style="s2">case thinking us to have a goal and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.180" end="00:23:21.530" style="s2">think there are two goals I thinking can</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.380" end="00:23:23.690" style="s2">have one of them is understanding okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.530" end="00:23:24.710" style="s2">where truth is a necessary condition has</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.690" end="00:23:25.790" style="s2">to arrive at the truth in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.710" end="00:23:27.020" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.790" end="00:23:30.650" style="s2">because you there are just truths that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.020" end="00:23:33.710" style="s2">are not important to know and so so a</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.650" end="00:23:35.210" style="s2">lot of thinking that we do will end when</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.710" end="00:23:36.380" style="s2">you&#39;ve understood whatever it was you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.210" end="00:23:39.470" style="s2">trying to understand you&#39;re like I got</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.380" end="00:23:41.450" style="s2">it there we&#39;re done and some forms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.470" end="00:23:42.590" style="s2">thinking are wonderful like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.450" end="00:23:44.390" style="s2">mathematical forms I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.590" end="00:23:45.530" style="s2">wonderful precisely because you reckon</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.390" end="00:23:46.850" style="s2">it&#39;s really clear when you&#39;ve gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.530" end="00:23:48.710" style="s2">that point and you have this like aha</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.850" end="00:23:50.120" style="s2">moment Plato actually described that as</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.710" end="00:23:51.350" style="s2">almost like you&#39;re remembering something</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.120" end="00:23:53.270" style="s2">you knew before because it has that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.350" end="00:23:55.610" style="s2">recognition like memory okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.270" end="00:23:56.690" style="s2">understanding then there&#39;s another kind</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.610" end="00:23:57.950" style="s2">of thinking and I think of it as very</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.690" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">different and you are right that some</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.950" end="00:24:00.170" style="s2">people want to collapse these two and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think they should be collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.170" end="00:24:05.660" style="s2">which is thinking that aims at the good</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:07.730" style="s2">in some way and that&#39;s deliberation so</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.660" end="00:24:09.830" style="s2">it&#39;s reasoning about how to achieve some</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.730" end="00:24:13.460" style="s2">good and I also think we often do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.830" end="00:24:15.050" style="s2">with other people and so we might want</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.460" end="00:24:17.900" style="s2">to bring something about and we think</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.050" end="00:24:21.290" style="s2">about how to do that okay I think those</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.900" end="00:24:22.730" style="s2">are the basic aims of thinking either</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.290" end="00:24:24.140" style="s2">understanding or</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.270" end="00:25:23.630" style="s2">life doesn&#39;t fall into this division but</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.620" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">for me see that&#39;s a principle just</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.630" end="00:25:28.220" style="s2">division right and truth has a part in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:29.710" style="s2">it now I think a lot of the things</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.220" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;re worried about with meaning like</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.710" end="00:25:33.980" style="s2">are there these truths that robbed my</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.760" style="s2">life of meaning what I would say is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:39.320" style="s2">those are situations in which you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.760" end="00:25:41.630" style="s2">accepted a descriptive analysis as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.320" end="00:25:43.460" style="s2">reductive one so like it&#39;s true that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.630" end="00:25:46.520" style="s2">made of atoms okay that&#39;s true I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.460" end="00:25:48.950" style="s2">it&#39;s true but that doesn&#39;t tell you who</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.520" end="00:25:50.780" style="s2">I really am it&#39;s it&#39;s a truth about me</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.950" end="00:25:52.550" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a good answer to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.780" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">question and so you shouldn&#39;t confuse</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.550" end="00:25:55.550" style="s2">the idea that something is a true</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:57.680" style="s2">proposition with the idea that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.550" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">good answer to a question in in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.680" end="00:26:00.890" style="s2">the question who I am I really is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:03.380" style="s2">the question you were seeking an answer</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.890" end="00:26:04.940" style="s2">to when we first met and and if I had</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.380" end="00:26:05.990" style="s2">said oh I&#39;m a bunch of atoms like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.940" end="00:26:07.670" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have satisfied you it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.990" end="00:26:09.920" style="s2">have been an answer to your question so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.670" end="00:26:13.970" style="s2">I would fold the meaning into</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.920" end="00:26:16.130" style="s2">understanding with the proviso that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.970" end="00:26:17.750" style="s2">have to you have to hold on tight to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.130" end="00:26:19.580" style="s2">your question and make sure that what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.750" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">someone has said in answer to it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.580" end="00:26:23.570" style="s2">just a true statement but actually an</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:26.540" style="s2">answer to the question to my way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.570" end="00:26:29.210" style="s2">thinking I would not say the category</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.540" end="00:26:32.420" style="s2">are that questions or as physicists</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.210" end="00:26:34.340" style="s2">would call them observables are tied to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:35.490" style="s2">a strata and that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.340" end="00:26:38.399" style="s2">questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.490" end="00:26:39.809" style="s2">badly suited to a particular strata so</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.399" end="00:26:43.260" style="s2">your description is atoms in your</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.809" end="00:26:45.029" style="s2">description as Agnes correspond to two</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.260" end="00:26:47.159" style="s2">different let&#39;s say effective theories</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.029" end="00:26:49.710" style="s2">which is sort of the tower of lies where</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.159" end="00:26:52.500" style="s2">there are more lies when I call you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.710" end="00:26:54.870" style="s2">Agnes then when I specify each of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.500" end="00:26:56.490" style="s2">atoms in your body but the point is is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.870" end="00:26:58.500" style="s2">that the question about what is Agnes</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.490" end="00:27:00.210" style="s2">like is not really questioned at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.500" end="00:27:04.679" style="s2">atomic layer it&#39;s a question at this</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.210" end="00:27:07.789" style="s2">personality layer with it with so in</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.679" end="00:27:10.770" style="s2">fact it is a kind of category error to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.789" end="00:27:12.990" style="s2">explore meaning doesn&#39;t belong at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.770" end="00:27:15.299" style="s2">atomic layer there is no atomic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.990" end="00:27:17.309" style="s2">right exactly but that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.299" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">that you don&#39;t need a separate meaning</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.309" end="00:27:22.260" style="s2">box you just need to keep track of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:23.690" style="s2">questions well that would be a since you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.260" end="00:27:25.770" style="s2">know just the way polar versus</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.690" end="00:27:26.909" style="s2">rectangular coordinates are two</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.770" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">different ways of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.909" end="00:27:30.330" style="s2">something I think you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:33.779" style="s2">make that point but what I think what</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.330" end="00:27:37.740" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get at is that I watch</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.779" end="00:27:39.809" style="s2">people you know he the reason I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.740" end="00:27:42.179" style="s2">taken a particular interest interest in</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.809" end="00:27:44.450" style="s2">philosophy is that once you&#39;ve taken a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.179" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">particular interest in mathematics you</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.450" end="00:27:48.899" style="s2">understand just how sensitive many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:50.370" style="s2">these things are to small issues of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.899" end="00:27:52.230" style="s2">language right and this is partially</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.370" end="00:27:53.399" style="s2">what happened to philosophy is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.230" end="00:27:55.080" style="s2">there were a lot of big interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.399" end="00:27:58.440" style="s2">questions and then there was a period of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.080" end="00:28:00.779" style="s2">time where it became a focus on language</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.440" end="00:28:05.130" style="s2">rather than on big meaningful meaty</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.779" end="00:28:07.799" style="s2">questions I don&#39;t know that the human</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.130" end="00:28:09.539" style="s2">layer supports this level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.799" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">because of some of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.539" end="00:28:15.299" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about so you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:17.220" style="s2">notice I mean I don&#39;t even think for</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.299" end="00:28:18.990" style="s2">example that there is a status game I</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.220" end="00:28:21.179" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a panoply of status</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.990" end="00:28:23.190" style="s2">games and that they&#39;re taking place</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.179" end="00:28:26.220" style="s2">simultaneously in a million different</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.190" end="00:28:28.260" style="s2">dimensions and the key question is can</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.220" end="00:28:29.789" style="s2">we isolate the principal components of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.260" end="00:28:31.049" style="s2">some of those so that we understand like</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.789" end="00:28:33.779" style="s2">whether what is what is where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.049" end="00:28:35.100" style="s2">majority of the action happening or are</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.779" end="00:28:36.809" style="s2">we actually doing violence to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.100" end="00:28:38.370" style="s2">problem by virtue of the fact that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.809" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">singled out a few of them and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.370" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">missed named it while that was going on</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:45.929" style="s2">in the status game so for example any</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">univariate measure has the property that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.929" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">it has an ordering on it but every by</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:53.470" style="s2">variant measure unless</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:55.750" style="s2">as a metric does not imply an ordering</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.470" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">like if you have one attribute that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.750" end="00:29:00.460" style="s2">positive that is greater than mine and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.850" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">one that is worse until we can say in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.460" end="00:29:04.060" style="s2">some sense how those two things</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">interrelate we can&#39;t say Agnes is better</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.060" end="00:29:07.650" style="s2">than Eric or Eric is better than Agnes</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:10.690" style="s2">however if there&#39;s only one attribute</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.650" end="00:29:12.280" style="s2">like who can run faster then one of us</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.690" end="00:29:15.820" style="s2">is better and the other of us is worse</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.280" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">unless there&#39;s a bizarre tie now what</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.820" end="00:29:22.690" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get at is here we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:25.240" style="s2">21st century beings and we&#39;re outside of</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.240" end="00:29:30.730" style="s2">question is what is this philosophical</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.730" end="00:29:37.150" style="s2">is the is the examine life really aided</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.140" end="00:29:40.300" style="s2">by philosophy or is there a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.150" end="00:29:41.650" style="s2">infinite tower of questions and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.300" end="00:29:44.830" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of an intellectual</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.830" end="00:29:50.050" style="s2">getting into deeper and deeper water by</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.940" end="00:29:51.970" style="s2">noticing something only to find out that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.050" end="00:29:54.540" style="s2">the noticing created a larger problem</p>

<p begin="00:29:58.510" end="00:30:04.360" style="s2">philosophy is like you have to have a</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.180" end="00:30:20.230" style="s2">the first philosopher okay and you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.040" end="00:30:22.600" style="s2">this is pre Plato right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.230" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">pre-socratic philosophers um and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.600" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">know he he like Zeno&#39;s paradoxes are</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:29.470" style="s2">sort of woven into permanent en ism but</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:31.270" style="s2">the basic idea of based pontus basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.470" end="00:30:35.230" style="s2">thought is that there&#39;s only one thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.270" end="00:30:37.090" style="s2">you can say it is so there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.230" end="00:30:38.770" style="s2">there&#39;s just one thing it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.090" end="00:30:42.760" style="s2">one thing you can say about it that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.770" end="00:30:46.680" style="s2">is and you&#39;re like well Parmenides no</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.760" end="00:30:50.170" style="s2">look there&#39;s also like this chair is and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.680" end="00:30:52.750" style="s2">Parmenides is saying says well if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.170" end="00:30:55.030" style="s2">say that the chair is and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.750" end="00:30:57.070" style="s2">say that the chair is something and is</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.030" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">different from say that table right then</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.070" end="00:31:00.990" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that the chair is not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:02.920" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.990" end="00:31:06.820" style="s2">so you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.920" end="00:31:11.559" style="s2">the chair is not but you&#39;re also saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.820" end="00:31:13.299" style="s2">that it is Parmenides and generations of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.559" end="00:31:15.520" style="s2">people have different entities thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.299" end="00:31:19.330" style="s2">this was like just this really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.520" end="00:31:21.570" style="s2">puzzle about how non-being can be how</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.330" end="00:31:27.090" style="s2">can how can there be anything that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.570" end="00:31:30.100" style="s2">like this chair not being this table and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.090" end="00:31:32.590" style="s2">the the the the problem of non-being is</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.100" end="00:31:34.870" style="s2">has a lot of different manifestations so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.590" end="00:31:37.179" style="s2">DIF is one manifestation change over</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.870" end="00:31:38.410" style="s2">time how can the chair at one time exist</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.179" end="00:31:43.030" style="s2">and then later it&#39;s collapsed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.410" end="00:31:46.179" style="s2">not there anymore and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.030" end="00:31:49.090" style="s2">Parmenides thought was that our like our</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.179" end="00:31:51.280" style="s2">thinking cannot support this way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.090" end="00:31:52.510" style="s2">talking it&#39;s like it&#39;s just words when</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.280" end="00:31:54.190" style="s2">we when we when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.510" end="00:31:56.290" style="s2">diversity out in the world and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.190" end="00:31:57.669" style="s2">only one thing we can coherently say</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.290" end="00:31:59.049" style="s2">there&#39;s only one thing where when we say</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.669" end="00:32:01.240" style="s2">it we&#39;ve understood what we said and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.049" end="00:32:03.070" style="s2">that&#39;s it is now Plato comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.240" end="00:32:04.870" style="s2">he&#39;s like no Parmenides that&#39;s nuts we</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.070" end="00:32:06.669" style="s2">have to be able to talk about some kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.870" end="00:32:08.710" style="s2">of difference but you&#39;re right that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.669" end="00:32:10.030" style="s2">entire world as we see it right the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.710" end="00:32:11.260" style="s2">entire sensible world that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.030" end="00:32:12.970" style="s2">nonsense that doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.260" end="00:32:14.380" style="s2">that&#39;s a bunch of contradictions but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.970" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">there are these things called forms okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.380" end="00:32:17.620" style="s2">like the beautiful or the just or</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.870" style="s2">whatever and at least the beautiful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.620" end="00:32:22.419" style="s2">always beautiful the only mystery about</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.870" end="00:32:23.650" style="s2">it is that it is beautiful and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.419" end="00:32:25.450" style="s2">something I can say the beautiful is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.650" end="00:32:27.940" style="s2">beautiful the just is just so at least</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.450" end="00:32:29.380" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m like one step beyond Parmenides</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.940" end="00:32:30.760" style="s2">right I&#39;m like I can talk about these</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.380" end="00:32:34.210" style="s2">forms I still can&#39;t talk about the chair</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.760" end="00:32:36.790" style="s2">right um okay and then you get Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.210" end="00:32:38.500" style="s2">and Aristotle&#39;s like um though guys we</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.790" end="00:32:40.450" style="s2">have to be able to talk about like human</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.500" end="00:32:42.820" style="s2">beings and things and and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.450" end="00:32:45.160" style="s2">enrich our language further now the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.820" end="00:32:47.740" style="s2">reason I bring all this up is that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.160" end="00:32:49.690" style="s2">basic philosophical impulse is that when</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.740" end="00:32:51.610" style="s2">you draw distinctions and you carve</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.690" end="00:32:53.500" style="s2">things up and you talk about layers okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.610" end="00:32:55.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve in a sense you&#39;ve in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.500" end="00:32:57.309" style="s2">collapsed your own thought into a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.630" end="00:33:00.549" style="s2">of different things that are like not</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.309" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">unified right and you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.549" end="00:33:05.980" style="s2">see the unity of them if you can&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:07.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t actually had a thought like you</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.980" end="00:33:10.419" style="s2">haven&#39;t thought anything you just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.900" end="00:33:12.730" style="s2">words so philosophers are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.419" end="00:33:14.350" style="s2">attuned to this worry that we might just</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.730" end="00:33:16.510" style="s2">be saying words and not having thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.350" end="00:33:18.010" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a standard</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.510" end="00:33:22.809" style="s2">for the unity of a thought that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.010" end="00:33:24.100" style="s2">pretty high standard and and so like if</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.809" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">you draw a distinction you need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.100" end="00:33:27.010" style="s2">understand the unity that underlies the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:32.890" style="s2">distinction and what legitimates the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.010" end="00:33:34.780" style="s2">distinction and so like if I say you</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.890" end="00:33:35.860" style="s2">know if I say even like I ate the cookie</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.780" end="00:33:36.970" style="s2">even though I knew that it wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.860" end="00:33:38.290" style="s2">right thing to do and you&#39;re like well</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.970" end="00:33:39.669" style="s2">wait a minute you free lead the cooking</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.290" end="00:33:41.770" style="s2">you chose Danika cookie yes</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.669" end="00:33:42.910" style="s2">so that was an intentional action yes so</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.770" end="00:33:44.860" style="s2">an intentional actions when we have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.910" end="00:33:45.820" style="s2">reason yes so a reason means that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.860" end="00:33:46.900" style="s2">think that it&#39;s all things considered</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.820" end="00:33:48.429" style="s2">the best thing to do yes that&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.900" end="00:33:49.870" style="s2">reason is wait a minute you just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.429" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">you thought it was all things considered</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.870" end="00:33:52.720" style="s2">the best thing to do and you thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">that there was something better that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:55.780" style="s2">should do you just contradicted yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:33:57.340" style="s2">right and Parmenides thought that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.780" end="00:33:58.870" style="s2">contradicting yourself was written into</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.340" end="00:34:01.750" style="s2">this is a chair and this is a table</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.870" end="00:34:03.610" style="s2">right and so you know so we&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.750" end="00:34:07.570" style="s2">really far we can talk about so much now</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.610" end="00:34:10.270" style="s2">but only I think because only if we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.570" end="00:34:12.970" style="s2">sort of back those checks that these</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.270" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">distinctions have some way of like</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.970" end="00:34:25.929" style="s2">holding together breathe with me</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:28.270" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.929" end="00:34:32.109" style="s2">singularly unmoved by this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.270" end="00:34:35.500" style="s2">thinking well object to it well where</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.109" end="00:34:37.419" style="s2">did I go wrong at least I went wrong you</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.500" end="00:34:39.790" style="s2">know Hegel at some point said the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.419" end="00:34:41.740" style="s2">absolute idea the ideas unity of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.790" end="00:34:43.780" style="s2">subject of an objective idea is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.740" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">notion of the idea a notion whose object</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.780" end="00:34:47.830" style="s2">is the idea as such and for which</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:52.470" style="s2">objective is idea and object embracing</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.830" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">all characteristics in its unity okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.470" end="00:35:01.390" style="s2">when I talk like that I sound insane to</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:35:05.170" style="s2">myself and the key question for me is</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.390" end="00:35:08.500" style="s2">what is an idea that settles down when</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.170" end="00:35:10.630" style="s2">its analysis doesn&#39;t sort of alter and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.500" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">destroy it it&#39;s sort of a fixed point if</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.630" end="00:35:16.690" style="s2">you will under analysis so if I</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">communicate the problem with let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.690" end="00:35:20.020" style="s2">with the status game with which we began</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">our discussion this is that in some</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.020" end="00:35:24.900" style="s2">cases when you call attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:27.400" style="s2">need for status you diminish your status</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.900" end="00:35:28.750" style="s2">that&#39;s also true I think that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.400" end="00:35:29.790" style="s2">only reason why you can&#39;t cause but</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.750" end="00:35:31.470" style="s2">there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.790" end="00:35:34.200" style="s2">which you can try to call attention to</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.470" end="00:35:36.540" style="s2">your status in which the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.200" end="00:35:37.940" style="s2">status that you achieve by calling</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.540" end="00:35:40.290" style="s2">attention to your status remains</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.360" style="s2">constant that the calling doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.290" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">effectively alter the problem for</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.360" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">example you might signal that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">comfortable enough in your own skin to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:51.150" style="s2">talk about a part of your minds petty</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:52.860" style="s2">needs and a part of your minds</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.150" end="00:35:55.020" style="s2">reasonable needs for status I have both</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.860" end="00:35:57.180" style="s2">for example and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.020" end="00:35:58.980" style="s2">terrible thing to say that there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.180" end="00:36:01.590" style="s2">times when I simply want to be regarded</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.980" end="00:36:04.680" style="s2">because I am and that there are times</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.590" end="00:36:07.190" style="s2">that I want to be regarded because it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.680" end="00:36:09.750" style="s2">important not to deranged a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.190" end="00:36:11.490" style="s2">let&#39;s say I only have 45 minutes for</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.750" end="00:36:13.920" style="s2">something and if we begin with the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.490" end="00:36:16.860" style="s2">notion of Who I am it will take too long</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.920" end="00:36:19.590" style="s2">so there&#39;s always this question in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.860" end="00:36:21.300" style="s2">bad breath example the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.590" end="00:36:22.830" style="s2">that the talking about it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.300" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">an interpretive complex or own</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.830" end="00:36:27.030" style="s2">client-side and your internal inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:29.750" style="s2">your interlocutors mind and so your</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.030" end="00:36:32.520" style="s2">input stimulates a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.750" end="00:36:34.230" style="s2">transpiring within the client-side</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.520" end="00:36:35.970" style="s2">architecture and it leads to an</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.230" end="00:36:39.960" style="s2">uncomfortable and unpleasant and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.970" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">untrue outcome if I could find the input</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.960" end="00:36:45.510" style="s2">which when processed remains the input</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:48.450" style="s2">right in other words it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.510" end="00:36:51.180" style="s2">eigenvalue of truth an eigenvector of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">truth then that&#39;s something which is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.180" end="00:36:57.860" style="s2">philosophically interesting to me what</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:57.860" style="s2">what concerns me is the tower of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.190" end="00:37:04.710" style="s2">concepts and conflicts which don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.350" end="00:37:08.190" style="s2">to settle down the more we understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.710" end="00:37:09.900" style="s2">them you know that so one thing is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.190" end="00:37:11.820" style="s2">really liked what you said about Hegel</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.900" end="00:37:14.460" style="s2">when I talk like that I sound crazy to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.820" end="00:37:16.050" style="s2">myself so I think that is Parmenides</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.460" end="00:37:18.120" style="s2">this point about saying that something</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.050" end="00:37:20.580" style="s2">is not Parmenides is the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.120" end="00:37:22.440" style="s2">realized when I talk like that when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.580" end="00:37:24.390" style="s2">say the chairs not the table they sound</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.440" end="00:37:25.890" style="s2">crazy to myself you&#39;re really used to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.390" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">talking that way cuz that&#39;s just how we</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.890" end="00:37:32.820" style="s2">talk Parmenides saw the giant crack in</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:36.780" style="s2">everything and and so if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.820" end="00:37:38.760" style="s2">how like when I hear someone say I know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.780" end="00:37:40.470" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t have this cookie but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.760" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2">really feel like it so I&#39;m gonna have it</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.470" end="00:37:45.660" style="s2">if I talk like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:47.610" style="s2">I sound crazy to myself and so I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.660" end="00:37:48.930" style="s2">I can&#39;t I can&#39;t talk like this I have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.610" end="00:37:50.970" style="s2">find another way of talking okay so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.930" end="00:37:54.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea that at some level first</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.970" end="00:37:56.190" style="s2">of all you need a primary description of</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.150" end="00:37:59.130" style="s2">the most of us understand weakness of</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.190" end="00:38:01.770" style="s2">will intuitively but we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.130" end="00:38:03.720" style="s2">weakness of well as a is emergent from</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.770" end="00:38:05.400" style="s2">fundamental principles and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.720" end="00:38:07.860" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it intuitively you just</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.400" end="00:38:09.780" style="s2">think you do well again you can pick out</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.860" end="00:38:11.460" style="s2">the phenomenon you can be making this to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.780" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">your point about the practicality you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.460" end="00:38:15.180" style="s2">may be able to work with it at a</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:17.460" style="s2">practical level so for example I might</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.180" end="00:38:19.770" style="s2">be able to sell a product where you put</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.460" end="00:38:21.300" style="s2">cookies in a time-release safe and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.770" end="00:38:24.119" style="s2">you you can&#39;t get it your own cookies</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.300" end="00:38:27.210" style="s2">until one is dispensed to you people</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.119" end="00:38:28.590" style="s2">will immediately understand that but the</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.210" end="00:38:30.510" style="s2">key question is you know can I take a</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.590" end="00:38:32.610" style="s2">placebo and get the placebo effect if</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.510" end="00:38:35.070" style="s2">it&#39;s labeled placebo you know these are</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.610" end="00:38:37.590" style="s2">the sort of unstable non fixed points of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.070" end="00:38:39.180" style="s2">the of the philosophical problem one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.590" end="00:38:41.430" style="s2">the reasons that I really love physics</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.180" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">as an alternative to philosophy at its</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.430" end="00:38:47.130" style="s2">ground level is is that it tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:49.950" style="s2">stable under analysis when we have an</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.130" end="00:38:51.810" style="s2">idea of a known quantum mechanics the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.950" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">propagation in quantum mechanics has a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.810" end="00:38:56.430" style="s2">very stable interpretation it may be</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:58.140" style="s2">wrong but we didn&#39;t think we know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.430" end="00:39:00.180" style="s2">going on when we&#39;re asking how an</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.140" end="00:39:02.490" style="s2">electron moves and it&#39;s when an electron</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.180" end="00:39:04.710" style="s2">gets measured when you&#39;re asking a bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.490" end="00:39:06.840" style="s2">question which is are you in state a or</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.710" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">state B and it was in state a plus B</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.840" end="00:39:10.830" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:13.230" style="s2">then the multiple-choice nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.830" end="00:39:16.530" style="s2">quantum mechanical question is bizarrely</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.230" end="00:39:19.350" style="s2">accommodated by the system somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.530" end="00:39:22.490" style="s2">randomly falling into state a or state B</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.350" end="00:39:24.660" style="s2">as a weighted probability no that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.490" end="00:39:27.900" style="s2">bothers us because we have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.660" end="00:39:30.180" style="s2">that maybe that&#39;s not really a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.900" end="00:39:31.950" style="s2">point how did we know what we were when</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.180" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">we asked the question where we part of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.950" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2">the quantum system did we hold ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.280" style="s2">aside and keep ourselves classical while</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.150" end="00:39:40.080" style="s2">asking that the electron be considered</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.280" end="00:39:42.450" style="s2">quantum mechanically was it in a semi</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.080" end="00:39:44.100" style="s2">quantum semi classical state so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.450" end="00:39:48.200" style="s2">not really sure whether we&#39;ve committed</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.100" end="00:39:48.200" style="s2">a sin against God and logic in that case</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.350" end="00:39:54.210" style="s2">yeah good I mean I think that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:56.849" style="s2">your worries about the the tower and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.210" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">I still think they go back</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.849" end="00:40:06.660" style="s2">- something there&#39;s a question whether</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:09.210" style="s2">we ever make any progress in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.660" end="00:40:12.839" style="s2">conversation that seems to me to be the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.210" end="00:40:15.299" style="s2">real question they&#39;re like can we learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.839" end="00:40:21.859" style="s2">from each other and can we learn from</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.299" end="00:40:30.210" style="s2">each other in some sense without making</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.859" end="00:40:32.309" style="s2">any without taking as the frame of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.210" end="00:40:34.440" style="s2">conversations something that we just</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.309" end="00:40:39.329" style="s2">happened to get slotted into and that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.440" end="00:40:42.210" style="s2">don&#39;t question right and and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.329" end="00:40:44.759" style="s2">think that it&#39;s true about philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.210" end="00:40:46.559" style="s2">that you are not guaranteed in any way</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.759" end="00:40:48.630" style="s2">that the answer to that question is yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.559" end="00:40:50.369" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that it&#39;s yes and there</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.630" end="00:40:53.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve had epiphanies in conversations</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.369" end="00:40:55.049" style="s2">which you&#39;ve changed your life ah my</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.700" end="00:41:01.049" style="s2">problem is that I have too many of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.049" end="00:41:04.200" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s not a dearth of epiphanies</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.049" end="00:41:05.219" style="s2">it&#39;s a total state instability but can I</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.200" end="00:41:06.390" style="s2">just say there&#39;s that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.219" end="00:41:08.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this moment okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.390" end="00:41:10.410" style="s2">um like I feel like you&#39;re um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.460" end="00:41:12.450" style="s2">Mina okay this is the soccer this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.410" end="00:41:15.089" style="s2">Plato&#39;s Meno and they&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.450" end="00:41:17.119" style="s2">conversation Socrates is like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.089" end="00:41:19.589" style="s2">you&#39;re a big opponent of excellence</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.119" end="00:41:21.690" style="s2">Socrates Meno comes to Socrates knees</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.589" end="00:41:23.339" style="s2">like I want it I want excellence how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.690" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">i how do I get it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.339" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">and Socrates is like well let&#39;s start by</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:29.130" style="s2">figuring out what it is and Mina&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.180" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">that&#39;s not hard right um that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.130" end="00:41:32.489" style="s2">easy Meno says it&#39;s easy about like the</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:34.229" style="s2">seven times in a row it&#39;s really funny</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.489" end="00:41:35.579" style="s2">he&#39;s like here&#39;s what it&#39;s here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.229" end="00:41:36.749" style="s2">it and Socrates like refute some bunch</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.579" end="00:41:38.849" style="s2">of times and a certain point Minos like</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.749" end="00:41:40.559" style="s2">look this is not going anywhere like</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.849" end="00:41:43.619" style="s2">obviously you can just sort of come up</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.559" end="00:41:45.630" style="s2">with more words against my words how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.619" end="00:41:48.509" style="s2">we ever know we&#39;ll ever get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.630" end="00:41:49.739" style="s2">with this right and Socrates actually at</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.509" end="00:41:52.650" style="s2">that point turns to math and they use a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.739" end="00:41:54.150" style="s2">mathematical example about finding the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.650" end="00:41:56.009" style="s2">double square so if you have a square</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.150" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">and you want to find the square whose</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.009" end="00:41:59.880" style="s2">area is twice as big as that square and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:01.049" style="s2">how somebody who&#39;s goes into that</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.880" end="00:42:02.579" style="s2">problem making a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.049" end="00:42:04.769" style="s2">assumptions will never find the answer</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.579" end="00:42:07.799" style="s2">we talk about you why it&#39;s great example</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.769" end="00:42:10.559" style="s2">um but the point is afterwards Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.799" end="00:42:13.119" style="s2">is like yeah the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.559" end="00:42:18.700" style="s2">there is no guarantee we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:23.079" style="s2">right but I think that it is better we</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.700" end="00:42:25.690" style="s2">will be better men and braver if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.079" end="00:42:28.569" style="s2">believe that we ought to inquire then</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.690" end="00:42:30.279" style="s2">not and you know you say you like</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.569" end="00:42:32.440" style="s2">physics but I don&#39;t see it as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.279" end="00:42:34.329" style="s2">alternative in a sense that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.440" end="00:42:35.710" style="s2">gonna give me it&#39;s the layers levels</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.329" end="00:42:36.819" style="s2">problem right it&#39;s just physics it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.710" end="00:42:38.200" style="s2">gonna give me the answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.819" end="00:42:39.970" style="s2">questions I have and I can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.200" end="00:42:41.710" style="s2">abandon those questions and I would be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.970" end="00:42:43.569" style="s2">coward if I didn&#39;t try to find answers</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.710" end="00:42:45.940" style="s2">to them what coward is in a very high</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.569" end="00:42:48.430" style="s2">state of the stack for a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.940" end="00:42:50.289" style="s2">the stack right in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.430" end="00:42:53.410" style="s2">questions that really have come to</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.289" end="00:42:56.740" style="s2">animate me throughout my adult life have</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.410" end="00:42:59.319" style="s2">to do with this question how how can we</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.740" end="00:43:04.299" style="s2">improve upon it is without involving</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.319" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">ourselves in the equation maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.299" end="00:43:08.349" style="s2">good I&#39;m mostly interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:11.109" style="s2">equations that essentially involve me</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.349" end="00:43:15.759" style="s2">right so that might be a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.109" end="00:43:17.170" style="s2">when you say coward-like I think in some</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.759" end="00:43:21.160" style="s2">sense courage is what makes life worth</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.170" end="00:43:23.739" style="s2">living like I wouldn&#39;t if I didn&#39;t if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.160" end="00:43:25.630" style="s2">thought it was person um if I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.739" end="00:43:28.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t care about courage like if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.630" end="00:43:30.009" style="s2">thought I was okay being a coward yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.239" end="00:43:30.579" style="s2">would think that my life might not be</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.009" end="00:43:33.190" style="s2">worth living</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.579" end="00:43:34.779" style="s2">I think courage is the sense the at</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.190" end="00:43:36.849" style="s2">least the sense of the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.779" end="00:43:40.539" style="s2">courage is the sense that life is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.849" end="00:43:44.739" style="s2">merely a biological the life is worth</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.539" end="00:43:47.079" style="s2">something well okay so think about your</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.739" end="00:43:49.859" style="s2">background you are not only Jewish but</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.079" end="00:43:52.539" style="s2">Hungarian Jewish yes that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.859" end="00:43:54.489" style="s2">notice anything I mean you want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.539" end="00:43:57.369" style="s2">about a group of non cowardly human</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.489" end="00:43:59.499" style="s2">beings I would say Hungarian Jews are</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.369" end="00:44:01.259" style="s2">about one of the most courageous groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.499" end="00:44:04.630" style="s2">of people I&#39;ve ever dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.259" end="00:44:06.670" style="s2">ethnically courage is a huge trait</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.630" end="00:44:10.809" style="s2">different even from other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.670" end="00:44:12.460" style="s2">Ashkenazim I think it was very</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.809" end="00:44:17.799" style="s2">courageous of my parents to come here</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.460" end="00:44:21.519" style="s2">yeah yeah but I don&#39;t think that they</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.799" end="00:44:22.779" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know did they did they I</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.519" end="00:44:23.710" style="s2">don&#39;t think courage is something you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.779" end="00:44:25.540" style="s2">like hand down</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.710" end="00:44:26.890" style="s2">that way though I do think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.540" end="00:44:29.290" style="s2">facilitate the conditions of its</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.890" end="00:44:31.660" style="s2">acquisition and you can kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.290" end="00:44:34.390" style="s2">a system of selective pressures that</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.660" end="00:44:37.480" style="s2">existed in Hungary in the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.390" end="00:44:41.619" style="s2">community that produced an exaggerated</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.480" end="00:44:43.570" style="s2">extrema file response right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.619" end="00:44:45.849" style="s2">Edward Teller came from a firmament</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.570" end="00:44:48.310" style="s2">there was the you know you can&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.849" end="00:44:52.119" style="s2">a giraffe in isolation from the trees on</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.310" end="00:44:55.270" style="s2">which it feeds sure that that could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.119" end="00:44:56.980" style="s2">right um that mode of thinking is one</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.270" end="00:44:58.869" style="s2">that it&#39;s a little bit like the Addams</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.980" end="00:45:02.349" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t for me shed light on</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.869" end="00:45:03.820" style="s2">like like the circumstances in which I</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.349" end="00:45:05.710" style="s2">have to fight and what I have to fight</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.820" end="00:45:08.500" style="s2">for under this I have more courage and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.710" end="00:45:10.570" style="s2">take another look at it I mean in other</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.500" end="00:45:12.609" style="s2">words there this is the this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.570" end="00:45:15.099" style="s2">the problem which is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.609" end="00:45:16.690" style="s2">there is that what you feel and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.099" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">gonna use anything personal because I</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.690" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">asked you going into somebody like I get</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:23.859" style="s2">you know I had this erotic actress in</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:25.690" style="s2">your chair not too long ago and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.859" end="00:45:28.540" style="s2">want to ask her about the details of her</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.690" end="00:45:31.210" style="s2">sex life I wanted to talk around sex not</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.540" end="00:45:32.859" style="s2">about her sexuality which is what</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.210" end="00:45:34.060" style="s2">happens in every so I don&#39;t want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.859" end="00:45:36.190" style="s2">about anything that you haven&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.060" end="00:45:38.020" style="s2">surfaced but for example you held a</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.190" end="00:45:41.290" style="s2">seminar at the University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.020" end="00:45:44.410" style="s2">with an ex-husband talking about divorce</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.290" end="00:45:47.050" style="s2">now that is an incredibly courageous</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.410" end="00:45:50.140" style="s2">position from many from many</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.050" end="00:45:51.130" style="s2">perspectives right because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.140" end="00:45:53.770" style="s2">dealing with something that would</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.130" end="00:45:56.440" style="s2">usually cause feelings to well up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.770" end="00:45:58.510" style="s2">might touch on things that would</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.440" end="00:46:00.910" style="s2">actually alter and perhaps deform your</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.510" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">life but you felt that you had enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.910" end="00:46:06.790" style="s2">ability to do that with strength and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:08.320" style="s2">distance that it was something that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.790" end="00:46:09.640" style="s2">were not only willing to do but</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.320" end="00:46:12.970" style="s2">interested in doing in front of an</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.640" end="00:46:14.680" style="s2">audience right so maybe one thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.970" end="00:46:16.450" style="s2">interesting about the personal you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.680" end="00:46:20.680" style="s2">I think I wrote this to you in an email</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.450" end="00:46:22.570" style="s2">that I it&#39;s just I guess this is a just</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.680" end="00:46:24.609" style="s2">a psychological factor but no it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.570" end="00:46:28.630" style="s2">justice I think it&#39;s connected to some</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.609" end="00:46:30.580" style="s2">philosophical things but I don&#39;t things</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.630" end="00:46:34.119" style="s2">that other people would find like too</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.580" end="00:46:37.060" style="s2">personal and uncomfortable to share I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.119" end="00:46:37.510" style="s2">often have to consciously classify in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.060" end="00:46:39.369" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.510" end="00:46:41.230" style="s2">which of those which are those things</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.369" end="00:46:45.190" style="s2">and be like don&#39;t say it that way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.230" end="00:46:46.660" style="s2">yeah and so like I like I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.190" end="00:46:48.250" style="s2">learned by experience and we&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.660" end="00:46:50.170" style="s2">other people uncomfortable if I say</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.250" end="00:46:51.430" style="s2">things to someone I don&#39;t know that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.170" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">too personal but it doesn&#39;t make me</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.430" end="00:46:56.290" style="s2">uncomfortable so I don&#39;t have an inner</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">sense of that so there isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.290" end="00:47:00.850" style="s2">anything where I would be like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:04.540" style="s2">maybe there is better you can&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.850" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">it that it wouldn&#39;t be interesting for</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.540" end="00:47:08.020" style="s2">me to go there to prove to you that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.369" end="00:47:09.730" style="s2">exists for you right but that&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.020" end="00:47:11.320" style="s2">I guess to the divorce thing like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.730" end="00:47:12.760" style="s2">think it&#39;s not as courageous as it would</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.320" end="00:47:14.680" style="s2">be for other people because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.760" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">not as courageous for you as it would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.680" end="00:47:19.720" style="s2">for other people but are you really</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:21.369" style="s2">looking like I think you know another</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.720" end="00:47:24.130" style="s2">person who sat in that chair was Bryan</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.369" end="00:47:25.450" style="s2">Callen the comedian and actor and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.130" end="00:47:31.450" style="s2">made the point that there are no tough</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.450" end="00:47:35.770" style="s2">guys that ultimately the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.450" end="00:47:40.750" style="s2">is so frail and so prone to abuse an</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.770" end="00:47:43.060" style="s2">insult that in the face of actually you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.750" end="00:47:47.020" style="s2">know incredibly destructive pressures we</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.060" end="00:47:49.300" style="s2">all fold and you can discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.020" end="00:47:50.530" style="s2">straight okay so then courage is also</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.300" end="00:47:52.810" style="s2">important to me one of the reasons I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.530" end="00:47:54.700" style="s2">doing this the show and and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.810" end="00:47:55.660" style="s2">idea of naming the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.700" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.660" end="00:47:59.170" style="s2">has to do for me with answering the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.930" style="s2">question what would I have done during</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.170" end="00:48:04.119" style="s2">the McCarthy era is that I watched my</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.930" end="00:48:05.800" style="s2">family terrorized by this government and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.119" end="00:48:07.869" style="s2">I wanted to know what I would I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.800" end="00:48:10.150" style="s2">stood up or what I have cowered under a</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.869" end="00:48:11.650" style="s2">table so it&#39;s a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.150" end="00:48:16.270" style="s2">courage and by the way it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.650" end="00:48:18.369" style="s2">unpleasant many days but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.270" end="00:48:23.440" style="s2">kind of courage to which I am partially</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.369" end="00:48:25.270" style="s2">well suited okay so my question is isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.440" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">it a question of marginal courage and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.270" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">the marginal courage to which you in</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:31.960" style="s2">particular agnes are particularly well</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:34.300" style="s2">suited i mean the act of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.960" end="00:48:36.310" style="s2">another life into the world turns us all</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.300" end="00:48:37.570" style="s2">into cowards I guarantee you that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.310" end="00:48:42.820" style="s2">were a coward when it comes to your</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.570" end="00:48:44.109" style="s2">child um I actually think that question</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.820" end="00:48:45.640" style="s2">of courage with respect to one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.109" end="00:48:47.200" style="s2">children is much much more fine-grained</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.640" end="00:48:49.990" style="s2">like it comes up a thousand times a day</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.200" end="00:48:51.790" style="s2">in my interactions with them so it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.990" end="00:48:54.610" style="s2">but certainly certainly there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.790" end="00:48:55.930" style="s2">circumstances in which that you can say</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.610" end="00:48:57.310" style="s2">I&#39;m a coward with respect my children</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.930" end="00:48:58.510" style="s2">and other circumstances I think I have</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.310" end="00:49:01.210" style="s2">to exercise a lot of courage with</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.510" end="00:49:02.530" style="s2">respect to no nobody I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.210" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">talk about your child because I find it</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.530" end="00:49:06.910" style="s2">actually I brought that up and I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.200" end="00:49:08.440" style="s2">like to that would be the last time I</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.910" end="00:49:11.140" style="s2">would actually bring up your actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.440" end="00:49:13.869" style="s2">child okay if I think about Sophie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.140" end="00:49:18.430" style="s2">Choice yeah I get very angry at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.869" end="00:49:21.400" style="s2">existence of that book right because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.430" end="00:49:23.170" style="s2">issue of deforming people by choices</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.400" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">involving their own children where they</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.140" end="00:49:37.300" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s an evilness too simply</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:40.119" style="s2">making us participate I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.300" end="00:49:42.220" style="s2">Saddam Hussein&#39;s penchant for executing</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.119" end="00:49:44.530" style="s2">a family member and selling sending the</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.540" end="00:49:54.130" style="s2">complicit right everyone who brings a</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.890" end="00:49:56.080" style="s2">child into this world is that almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.130" end="00:49:58.450" style="s2">without exception either a monster or a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.080" end="00:50:03.220" style="s2">coward and in fact this is the ax</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.450" end="00:50:04.420" style="s2">brahmic sin I&#39;ll tell you the version of</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.220" end="00:50:05.740" style="s2">that thought that I have and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.420" end="00:50:07.480" style="s2">to answer the marginal question about</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.740" end="00:50:10.570" style="s2">courage the original I thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.480" end="00:50:14.740" style="s2">about that I&#39;ve had is like there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.570" end="00:50:17.350" style="s2">things that so when you invest yourself</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.740" end="00:50:22.060" style="s2">in anything right it&#39;s a point of</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.350" end="00:50:26.320" style="s2">vulnerability and if it&#39;s your child</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.060" end="00:50:28.150" style="s2">then in a sense you&#39;ve invested like</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.320" end="00:50:29.290" style="s2">your mind into them in this way where</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.150" end="00:50:30.550" style="s2">there are things that could happen to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.290" end="00:50:33.130" style="s2">them that you would never recover from</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.550" end="00:50:34.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s almost like you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.130" end="00:50:39.609" style="s2">yourself someone who could become insane</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.840" end="00:50:41.710" style="s2">because you have opened your mind to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.609" end="00:50:44.290" style="s2">wounded by the world in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.710" end="00:50:48.100" style="s2">that you cannot control anymore right</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.290" end="00:50:49.240" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what that is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.100" end="00:50:51.910" style="s2">know what the name for that if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.240" end="00:50:53.320" style="s2">correct it&#39;s certainly in order to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.910" end="00:50:55.119" style="s2">prevent those things from happening you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.320" end="00:50:57.310" style="s2">might do anything and so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.119" end="00:51:00.940" style="s2">the cowardice maybe right but it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.310" end="00:51:03.430" style="s2">than that right it&#39;s this kind of kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.940" end="00:51:04.020" style="s2">of exposure of yourself where like in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.430" end="00:51:06.240" style="s2">way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.020" end="00:51:07.350" style="s2">isn&#39;t your own anymore um that in a way</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.240" end="00:51:10.200" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s even deeper than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.350" end="00:51:11.550" style="s2">question about courage marginal question</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.200" end="00:51:15.120" style="s2">bout courage so the way aristotle think</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.550" end="00:51:16.560" style="s2">about this is that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.120" end="00:51:19.260" style="s2">different circumstances a person can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.560" end="00:51:20.760" style="s2">in and we call them courageous relative</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.260" end="00:51:21.840" style="s2">to a set of circumstances that are also</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.760" end="00:51:23.400" style="s2">relative to them and that&#39;s how you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.840" end="00:51:24.720" style="s2">think about the marginal point so like</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.400" end="00:51:26.280" style="s2">there are certain circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.720" end="00:51:29.340" style="s2">extreme that we couldn&#39;t expect of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.280" end="00:51:31.290" style="s2">anyone to do anything but be crushed by</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.340" end="00:51:32.520" style="s2">the pressure of the circumstances and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.290" end="00:51:33.750" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call them a coward for not</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.520" end="00:51:35.790" style="s2">responding but then there are also</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.750" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">circumstances where we would sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.790" end="00:51:39.180" style="s2">expect of anyone that they would stand</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:40.440" style="s2">up and we would call them a coward right</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.180" end="00:51:42.150" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the intermediate case</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.440" end="00:51:45.120" style="s2">and of course it&#39;s intermediate relative</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.150" end="00:51:47.160" style="s2">to us in some way so what I mean is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.120" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">have to care about courage and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.160" end="00:51:50.130" style="s2">way of putting the March at the point</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:55.230" style="s2">about the margin I have to I have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.130" end="00:51:57.180" style="s2">care about not just not just immediately</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.230" end="00:51:59.070" style="s2">caving to certain pressures I mean can I</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.180" end="00:52:00.390" style="s2">can I give an example that I actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.070" end="00:52:03.300" style="s2">think is a better example in the divorce</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.390" end="00:52:05.280" style="s2">one please but totally I will never</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.300" end="00:52:08.060" style="s2">attempt to interrogate your person if</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.280" end="00:52:10.350" style="s2">you don&#39;t offer it up yeah that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.060" end="00:52:11.820" style="s2">you know in a way this this this this</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.350" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">sort of reveals our difference it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.820" end="00:52:15.030" style="s2">I think through my personal life that</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:16.170" style="s2">that&#39;s like the lens or something you</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.030" end="00:52:17.430" style="s2">think you think through your personal</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.170" end="00:52:19.590" style="s2">life that&#39;s not theirs but there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.430" end="00:52:21.480" style="s2">levels of which I could interrogate that</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.590" end="00:52:23.190" style="s2">would be different than the levels at</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.480" end="00:52:24.840" style="s2">which you&#39;re interrogating yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.190" end="00:52:28.220" style="s2">absolutely but I might still have those</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.840" end="00:52:33.260" style="s2">in my head even if I don&#39;t say them um</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.220" end="00:52:33.260" style="s2">so like when</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.860" end="00:52:44.390" style="s2">when I like having that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.080" end="00:52:45.860" style="s2">with my ex-husband who I&#39;m good friends</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.390" end="00:52:49.880" style="s2">with we were divorced</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.860" end="00:52:54.430" style="s2">you know 2011 a long time ago right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.880" end="00:52:57.470" style="s2">um that really wasn&#39;t so hard but</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.430" end="00:52:59.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a thing I did in 2011 which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.470" end="00:53:00.560" style="s2">that I gave a talk about getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.870" end="00:53:06.050" style="s2">divorced</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.560" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">in 2011 because our divorced caused a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.050" end="00:53:08.900" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:10.970" style="s2">he&#39;s faculty member at Chicago and it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.900" end="00:53:13.790" style="s2">caused this huge sort of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.970" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">response in the whole community and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.790" end="00:53:18.320" style="s2">lot of people hated me a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:20.210" style="s2">still don&#39;t really talk to me as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.320" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">result of it just because of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.210" end="00:53:24.860" style="s2">divorce even though the two of you have</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:26.510" style="s2">accepted yourself correct um but it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.860" end="00:53:30.850" style="s2">like you know sometimes there are wounds</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.510" end="00:53:30.850" style="s2">that are created and then they get</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.880" end="00:53:37.910" style="s2">supported um they they they they I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.800" end="00:53:40.940" style="s2">know what the right word is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.910" end="00:53:42.590" style="s2">they they get scarred over is that like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.940" end="00:53:46.220" style="s2">it comes from the divorce it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.590" end="00:53:50.570" style="s2">the etiology of the divorce yes right so</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.220" end="00:53:52.940" style="s2">it but I gave a talk about this about</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.570" end="00:53:55.310" style="s2">getting divorced and falling in love and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.940" end="00:53:57.170" style="s2">what love and marriage and divorce are</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.310" end="00:54:00.280" style="s2">and I gave this talk because I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.170" end="00:54:03.730" style="s2">worried I didn&#39;t mind if people were um</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.280" end="00:54:06.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t like me or my choices or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.730" end="00:54:08.210" style="s2">except my students I was worried about</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.080" end="00:54:12.410" style="s2">my students I was worried that if the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.210" end="00:54:13.940" style="s2">students that I had taught came to sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.410" end="00:54:15.800" style="s2">of I don&#39;t know except a bunch of gossip</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.940" end="00:54:18.440" style="s2">and rumor about me that I would that it</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.800" end="00:54:21.230" style="s2">would both undo the teaching that I had</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.440" end="00:54:23.720" style="s2">done of them and get in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.230" end="00:54:27.670" style="s2">potential teaching in the future</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.720" end="00:54:30.350" style="s2">that it was like a professional</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.670" end="00:54:32.600" style="s2">obligation that I had to clarify the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.350" end="00:54:34.100" style="s2">situation for my students like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.600" end="00:54:35.570" style="s2">mind if people gossip about me but I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.100" end="00:54:37.700" style="s2">mind if the people I&#39;m trying to teach</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.570" end="00:54:39.260" style="s2">but I don&#39;t even think you&#39;re I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.700" end="00:54:40.850" style="s2">don&#39;t believe you that you don&#39;t mind if</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.260" end="00:54:43.700" style="s2">people gossip about you you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.850" end="00:54:45.080" style="s2">able to start I do I write that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.700" end="00:54:46.720" style="s2">meant what I meant was I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.080" end="00:54:49.310" style="s2">moral obligation to try to correct that</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.720" end="00:54:50.570" style="s2">but I did feel I had an obligation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.310" end="00:54:53.120" style="s2">there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.570" end="00:54:54.380" style="s2">like people you know through</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.120" end="00:54:57.020" style="s2">backchannels we&#39;re telling me like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.380" end="00:54:59.000" style="s2">give this talk do not like you know do</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.020" end="00:55:02.660" style="s2">not give a public talk about your life</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.000" end="00:55:07.820" style="s2">and and it was like can you say what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.660" end="00:55:17.810" style="s2">contents of the talk wer about or some</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.820" end="00:55:19.460" style="s2">day it was so I mean really in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.810" end="00:55:21.620" style="s2">the talk was quite academic it was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.460" end="00:55:26.180" style="s2">talk about love so it was it started</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.620" end="00:55:27.950" style="s2">with the circumstances which is I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.180" end="00:55:28.550" style="s2">married to someone and I fell in love</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.950" end="00:55:31.340" style="s2">with someone else</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.550" end="00:55:33.170" style="s2">okay and then I was like I didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.340" end="00:55:34.580" style="s2">that that was like the kind of person I</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.170" end="00:55:38.270" style="s2">was the kind of person to whom that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.580" end="00:55:40.820" style="s2">could happen but it did happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.270" end="00:55:44.870" style="s2">tried to explain it and I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.820" end="00:55:48.860" style="s2">explain it using some of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.870" end="00:55:51.230" style="s2">texts that I think shed the most light</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.860" end="00:55:52.850" style="s2">on my own situation so they were I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.230" end="00:55:54.320" style="s2">I talked about this passage from Henry</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.850" end="00:55:57.470" style="s2">James as wings of the Dove and from</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.320" end="00:56:00.800" style="s2">Plato&#39;s symposium about what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.470" end="00:56:03.860" style="s2">love was and how it was related to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.800" end="00:56:06.800" style="s2">kind of quest to become a person okay so</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.860" end="00:56:09.740" style="s2">that that&#39;s what the talk was about but</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.800" end="00:56:12.110" style="s2">it was like it was like I wanted to give</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.740" end="00:56:14.030" style="s2">to my students my own understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.110" end="00:56:15.980" style="s2">what had happened to me I felt very much</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.030" end="00:56:17.810" style="s2">like this might be self aggrandizing but</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.980" end="00:56:21.590" style="s2">I felt like Socrates when Socrates says</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.810" end="00:56:23.180" style="s2">in the sympathy apology I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.590" end="00:56:25.730" style="s2">to you the meaning of what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.180" end="00:56:28.010" style="s2">to me and he&#39;s he&#39;s speaking there after</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.730" end="00:56:29.630" style="s2">they&#39;ve condemned him to death and he</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.010" end="00:56:30.770" style="s2">says and he&#39;s already spoken to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.630" end="00:56:33.800" style="s2">people who condemn him he&#39;s like to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.770" end="00:56:35.420" style="s2">people who voted not to condemn me to my</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.800" end="00:56:37.160" style="s2">students and my friends I want to show</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.420" end="00:56:40.490" style="s2">to you the meaning I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.160" end="00:56:41.570" style="s2">understand and it was really important</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.490" end="00:56:44.540" style="s2">to him that those people understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.570" end="00:56:45.890" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t want to sabotage the</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.540" end="00:56:47.300" style="s2">educational project that they had been</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.890" end="00:56:48.770" style="s2">involved in and that&#39;s what I felt at</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.300" end="00:56:50.750" style="s2">that time so in other words in order for</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.770" end="00:56:52.610" style="s2">me to infer why you would do this</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.750" end="00:56:54.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s a rather odd thing to do at</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.610" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">one level and their understandable in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.170" end="00:57:00.080" style="s2">another I would have to surmise and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:02.210" style="s2">infer that you would in fact invested</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.080" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">certain teachings of yours to your</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.210" end="00:57:07.069" style="s2">students with the personal</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:09.410" style="s2">therefore calling it means you see one</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.069" end="00:57:11.059" style="s2">thing no I actually no that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.410" end="00:57:13.520" style="s2">right so first of all I don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.059" end="00:57:16.160" style="s2">teachings um so I didn&#39;t hadn&#39;t invested</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:20.260" style="s2">in teach ethics absolutely okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.160" end="00:57:24.170" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine wanting to teach ethics</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.260" end="00:57:27.049" style="s2">because if I&#39;m aware of my own ethical</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.170" end="00:57:28.339" style="s2">failings and you know there are many</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.049" end="00:57:32.299" style="s2">they are many and varied and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.339" end="00:57:35.630" style="s2">unremarkable yeah the idea of getting up</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.299" end="00:57:37.069" style="s2">and talking about ethical failings of</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.630" end="00:57:38.809" style="s2">others and why you shouldn&#39;t fail</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.069" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">ethically you know I&#39;m friends with sam</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.809" end="00:57:43.010" style="s2">harris and he really doesn&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:44.839" style="s2">much in lying now he&#39;s not absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.010" end="00:57:47.150" style="s2">fanatical about it he knows there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.839" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">certain cases where he has to lie but I</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.150" end="00:57:53.690" style="s2">would never want because I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.099" style="s2">be aware of truthfulness and fickleness</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.690" end="00:57:57.380" style="s2">and all these sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.099" end="00:58:01.220" style="s2">you know status for example I have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.380" end="00:58:03.079" style="s2">need for status it&#39;s not a standard need</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.220" end="00:58:07.099" style="s2">for status in some ways in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.079" end="00:58:07.640" style="s2">it&#39;s boring but I don&#39;t mind talking</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.099" end="00:58:10.670" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.640" end="00:58:13.279" style="s2">because I I can make contact within it I</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.670" end="00:58:14.690" style="s2">don&#39;t feel diminished by inheriting a</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.279" end="00:58:17.299" style="s2">human condition the thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.690" end="00:58:19.460" style="s2">distorts me is that I feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.299" end="00:58:22.460" style="s2">all handed this white suit that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.460" end="00:58:24.920" style="s2">want at Birth and then as we live our</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.460" end="00:58:28.849" style="s2">lives all of the things that we do and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.920" end="00:58:32.510" style="s2">we spill our soup or you know we spend</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.849" end="00:58:34.490" style="s2">time in the barn end up soiling this</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.510" end="00:58:36.890" style="s2">white suit and people look at us and say</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.490" end="00:58:38.630" style="s2">my god you know look at you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.890" end="00:58:40.279" style="s2">my question is well who ordered the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.630" end="00:58:43.339" style="s2">white suit to begin with wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.279" end="00:58:46.099" style="s2">rather start with a baseline that says I</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.339" end="00:58:48.230" style="s2">bet I&#39;m a fairly standard person and if</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.099" end="00:58:50.779" style="s2">lying is a problem and if hypocrisy is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.230" end="00:58:53.029" style="s2">problem if injustice and bigotry are</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.779" end="00:58:55.700" style="s2">problems wouldn&#39;t I want to give myself</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.029" end="00:58:57.410" style="s2">a budget in all of those areas and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.700" end="00:59:00.200" style="s2">key question is trying to live within</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.410" end="00:59:01.970" style="s2">one&#39;s means I think that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.200" end="00:59:04.250" style="s2">right so when you said like I have all</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.970" end="00:59:05.480" style="s2">these flaws like that&#39;s why you want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.250" end="00:59:07.869" style="s2">teach ethics because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.480" end="00:59:10.099" style="s2">understand them I mean um</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.869" end="00:59:12.619" style="s2">the thing about the white suit so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.099" end="00:59:16.130" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really pervasive myth in</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.619" end="00:59:18.480" style="s2">our society and it&#39;s maybe a bad a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.130" end="00:59:20.190" style="s2">of good legacies of Christianity bits</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.480" end="00:59:22.350" style="s2">the kind of virtues of innocence idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.190" end="00:59:23.730" style="s2">the idea that we all start out ethically</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.350" end="00:59:25.200" style="s2">good right and that&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.730" end="00:59:26.880" style="s2">status game point about how we get</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.200" end="00:59:28.260" style="s2">something for free right but that and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:29.850" style="s2">the idea as well maybe you can sully it</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.260" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">maybe you can sort of and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.850" end="00:59:33.450" style="s2">clean it up again and that can be your</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:34.800" style="s2">ethical agency right but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.450" end="00:59:35.250" style="s2">that children have some kind of innate</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.800" end="00:59:36.810" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.250" end="00:59:38.460" style="s2">I think virtue is something you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.810" end="00:59:40.200" style="s2">acquire like in you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.460" end="00:59:42.330" style="s2">come to an understanding of what matters</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.200" end="00:59:44.730" style="s2">but the point is society voiced the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.330" end="00:59:46.500" style="s2">white suit upon right right so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.730" end="00:59:48.690" style="s2">that&#39;s theme so you you have to say I</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.500" end="00:59:50.790" style="s2">reject this white suit I will fashion my</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.690" end="00:59:54.450" style="s2">own yeah if you don&#39;t want to disappoint</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.790" end="00:59:58.290" style="s2">people right now that the problem there</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.450" end="01:00:01.260" style="s2">is that I believe that your privacy like</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.290" end="01:00:05.940" style="s2">for example we see very few of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.260" end="01:00:08.370" style="s2">colleagues naked yeah there was a there</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.940" end="01:00:10.560" style="s2">was a professor that would was probably</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.370" end="01:00:13.260" style="s2">the closest to being my official adviser</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.560" end="01:00:15.570" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have a PhD advisor but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.260" end="01:00:18.210" style="s2">person who signed my thesis as if he was</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.570" end="01:00:21.150" style="s2">my PhD advisor had a Holman in in</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.210" end="01:00:23.130" style="s2">Martha&#39;s Vineyard and we would we would</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.150" end="01:00:25.140" style="s2">swim naked together you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.130" end="01:00:26.730" style="s2">that was what one did he was the Sun</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.140" end="01:00:32.340" style="s2">worshipper mm-hmm uh-huh</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.730" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">in a Hungarian Jew the the fact that we</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.340" end="01:00:37.650" style="s2">don&#39;t see each other naked means that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:40.350" style="s2">we&#39;re stunned whenever we do catch a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.650" end="01:00:41.610" style="s2">glimpse of somebody out of context in</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.350" end="01:00:43.860" style="s2">which they are in their most natural</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.610" end="01:00:45.450" style="s2">state and this has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.860" end="01:00:47.130" style="s2">that we are handed these clothes and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.450" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">told to wear it wear them at all times</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.130" end="01:00:52.440" style="s2">and then our our simple underlying</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">reality is totally shocking so it seems</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.440" end="01:00:56.580" style="s2">to me very sad that you would have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:58.200" style="s2">give the lecture I&#39;m not saying that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.580" end="01:01:00.570" style="s2">you might want to give the lecture you</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.200" end="01:01:02.430" style="s2">might enjoy the exhibition of it you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.570" end="01:01:04.380" style="s2">might enjoy the courage exercise of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.430" end="01:01:06.360" style="s2">you might enjoy the intellectual puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.380" end="01:01:08.430" style="s2">of it but the idea that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.360" end="01:01:11.360" style="s2">compulsion so as not to ruin your</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.430" end="01:01:13.950" style="s2">students has to do with the flaw of</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.360" end="01:01:16.730" style="s2">having accepted the white suit to begin</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.950" end="01:01:20.280" style="s2">with and therefore losing your privacy</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.730" end="01:01:24.480" style="s2">um it&#39;s a really good point so I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">that can I do a victory dance I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.480" end="01:01:29.460" style="s2">but I think and I see what you mean and</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:32.080" style="s2">I think what you&#39;re helping me to see is</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.460" end="01:01:35.110" style="s2">that I have somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.080" end="01:01:37.780" style="s2">framed what I was doing slightly wrong</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.110" end="01:01:41.950" style="s2">like I it&#39;s the point what the thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.780" end="01:01:46.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t like well if people if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.950" end="01:01:49.270" style="s2">give this talk then my students will</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.780" end="01:01:50.680" style="s2">think I did something evil and then they</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.270" end="01:01:54.820" style="s2">won&#39;t respect me anymore</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.680" end="01:01:57.250" style="s2">and now and and so instead I need to</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.820" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">like um excuse myself right and I need</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.250" end="01:02:02.530" style="s2">to show that actually I&#39;m as white as</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:04.600" style="s2">they thought I was and that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.530" end="01:02:06.250" style="s2">not like like for instance it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.600" end="01:02:08.500" style="s2">all what Socrates does at that moment in</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.250" end="01:02:10.660" style="s2">the apology actually what he says is</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.500" end="01:02:12.460" style="s2">that um he&#39;s like you might think that</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.660" end="01:02:13.450" style="s2">you know some really bad thing is half</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.460" end="01:02:14.590" style="s2">that&#39;s but he goes on to say you might</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.450" end="01:02:16.120" style="s2">think some really bad thing has happened</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.590" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">to me you might think this is terrible</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.120" end="01:02:18.070" style="s2">that they&#39;re putting me to death which</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:21.580" style="s2">is what everyone thinks about Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.070" end="01:02:22.870" style="s2">oh look this Plato showed that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.580" end="01:02:24.550" style="s2">have philosophy because look at this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.870" end="01:02:26.080" style="s2">terrible result and the whole point of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.550" end="01:02:27.850" style="s2">the apology is a Socrates like this</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.080" end="01:02:29.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t a bad thing not no bad thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.850" end="01:02:31.000" style="s2">happened to me yes they&#39;re putting me to</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.020" end="01:02:34.030" style="s2">death but a good man can&#39;t be harmed</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.000" end="01:02:36.880" style="s2">neither in life nor death and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.030" end="01:02:38.170" style="s2">you know I&#39;m like it&#39;s bad for them cuz</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.880" end="01:02:39.790" style="s2">they&#39;re doing something on just so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.170" end="01:02:41.380" style="s2">bad for their souls but it&#39;s not bad for</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.790" end="01:02:44.200" style="s2">me don&#39;t like don&#39;t feel sorry for me</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.380" end="01:02:49.570" style="s2">don&#39;t feel bad for right okay um and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.200" end="01:02:51.100" style="s2">guess so I guess as much as and I like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.570" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">think you were right in picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.100" end="01:02:56.650" style="s2">the kind of self excusing nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:03:00.040" style="s2">way that I put it but like if you think</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.650" end="01:03:02.800" style="s2">about what I told you as the content of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.040" end="01:03:06.540" style="s2">the talk right um it was more like as</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.800" end="01:03:08.950" style="s2">much as anything it was an opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.540" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">like to say something truthful about</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.950" end="01:03:12.870" style="s2">love that I had never I&#39;d never had such</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:15.160" style="s2">an opportunity because I had never</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.870" end="01:03:18.010" style="s2">someone one of my one of my colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.160" end="01:03:19.030" style="s2">came to the talk and he&#39;s like this was</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.010" end="01:03:20.380" style="s2">not a compliment this reserved a</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.030" end="01:03:22.060" style="s2">criticism he&#39;s like you talked as if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.380" end="01:03:24.010" style="s2">were Moses come down from the mountain</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.060" end="01:03:25.390" style="s2">like you like you had like as though you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.010" end="01:03:26.740" style="s2">had so much knowledge I guess though you</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.390" end="01:03:28.840" style="s2">thought you were Socrates or something</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.740" end="01:03:30.220" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m like yeah that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.840" end="01:03:32.710" style="s2">felt like I felt like I had all this</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.220" end="01:03:35.500" style="s2">knowledge and it was wonderful and I had</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.710" end="01:03:38.190" style="s2">to share it with my students and I so it</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.500" end="01:03:40.570" style="s2">was sort of it was almost like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.190" end="01:03:41.710" style="s2">there&#39;s two points of correction right</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.570" end="01:03:43.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a one point of correction would</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.710" end="01:03:45.460" style="s2">be to get to the white suit but the the</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.150" end="01:03:45.880" style="s2">actual content of the talk was to go the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.460" end="01:03:47.080" style="s2">step four</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.880" end="01:03:52.090" style="s2">they&#39;re like this was an educational</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.080" end="01:03:54.370" style="s2">opportunity and and I think that I I let</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.090" end="01:03:57.340" style="s2">myself not frame it that way</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.370" end="01:03:59.500" style="s2">in telling the story maybe somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.340" end="01:04:00.580" style="s2">under the pressure of the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.500" end="01:04:02.770" style="s2">self-purification</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.580" end="01:04:04.390" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a truthful way of telling</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.770" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">the story well but it but this is the</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.390" end="01:04:08.620" style="s2">question about whether to use the avenue</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:11.140" style="s2">of truth you see because at some level</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.620" end="01:04:15.630" style="s2">there&#39;s an aspect of of grace and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.140" end="01:04:19.120" style="s2">meaning that is present here which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.630" end="01:04:23.140" style="s2">the you know whether you know it or not</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.120" end="01:04:26.620" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know that you know this that</p>

<p begin="01:04:26.620" end="01:04:30.550" style="s2">on two different systems both of them</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.750" end="01:04:32.530" style="s2">within the autonomic nervous system one</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.550" end="01:04:34.660" style="s2">sympathetic one parasympathetic called</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.530" end="01:04:37.330" style="s2">psychogenic and reflects a genic arousal</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.660" end="01:04:40.360" style="s2">mmm-hmm and it&#39;s not under the conscious</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.330" end="01:04:42.520" style="s2">control of the prefrontal cortex it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.360" end="01:04:44.970" style="s2">much more primitive system nature&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.520" end="01:04:48.670" style="s2">going to trust the reproductive system</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.970" end="01:04:51.670" style="s2">to the prefrontal cortex and a friend of</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.670" end="01:04:55.570" style="s2">mine Leisha Lee just came out with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.670" end="01:04:58.090" style="s2">company I think called rosebud AI that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.570" end="01:05:02.590" style="s2">generates faces of people who never were</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.090" end="01:05:04.450" style="s2">and you can find that you know she I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.590" end="01:05:07.420" style="s2">sure she will release a tool at some</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.450" end="01:05:09.370" style="s2">point in which she finds your phenotype</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.420" end="01:05:11.230" style="s2">and can hone to a fare-thee-well and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.370" end="01:05:12.730" style="s2">create a person that you cannot tell has</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.230" end="01:05:15.340" style="s2">never existed and put them in all sorts</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.730" end="01:05:17.470" style="s2">of situations so that you can fall</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.340" end="01:05:22.230" style="s2">hopelessly in love with that which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.470" end="01:05:24.550" style="s2">not okay now because that&#39;s taking place</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.230" end="01:05:27.460" style="s2">effectively your prefrontal cortex is</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.550" end="01:05:29.560" style="s2">like your parent trying to get control</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.460" end="01:05:31.240" style="s2">of a child has been asked that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.560" end="01:05:34.590" style="s2">terrible question who wants ice cream</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.240" end="01:05:37.960" style="s2">and the child is now out of control okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.590" end="01:05:39.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t really talk about this because</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.960" end="01:05:41.710" style="s2">this is happening everywhere in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.670" end="01:05:42.970" style="s2">certain sense I mean we can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.710" end="01:05:46.920" style="s2">it in the general but not in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.970" end="01:05:50.530" style="s2">specific so for example you can say that</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.920" end="01:05:54.430" style="s2">self gratification is natural and normal</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.530" end="01:05:56.250" style="s2">and that the world engages on this</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.430" end="01:05:59.200" style="s2">almost without exception</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.250" end="01:05:59.740" style="s2">you cannot say I&#39;m sorry I was late for</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.200" end="01:06:02.619" style="s2">the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.740" end="01:06:08.350" style="s2">spent the morning lost an onanism right</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.619" end="01:06:11.110" style="s2">and as a result that kind of layer of</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.350" end="01:06:13.240" style="s2">indirection including in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.110" end="01:06:17.800" style="s2">using a language layer of indirection is</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.240" end="01:06:19.420" style="s2">a necessary part of the distortion of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.800" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">the truth that&#39;s needed for meaning</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.420" end="01:06:25.330" style="s2">fitness and grace different from pure</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.440" end="01:06:29.400" style="s2">truth and I think that you&#39;re caught in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.330" end="01:06:29.400" style="s2">the bad breath problem in this story</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.460" end="01:06:36.010" style="s2">right in the self purification we come</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.970" end="01:06:37.480" style="s2">from a tradition where those a ritual</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.010" end="01:06:42.600" style="s2">bath known as a mikvah</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.480" end="01:06:45.490" style="s2">and these purifying rituals are</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.600" end="01:06:47.350" style="s2">necessary to do what you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.490" end="01:06:48.820" style="s2">have to unfortunately got tied to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.350" end="01:06:50.770" style="s2">issue of menstruation and whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.820" end="01:06:54.730" style="s2">women are intrinsically dirty through</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.770" end="01:06:56.560" style="s2">the process of renewing themselves but</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.730" end="01:06:58.119" style="s2">simply the concept of a mikvah as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.560" end="01:07:01.360" style="s2">ritual and the fact that our brains have</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.119" end="01:07:03.970" style="s2">a place to allow us to be reborn hmm</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.360" end="01:07:06.390" style="s2">there&#39;s an incredibly powerful facility</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.970" end="01:07:08.710" style="s2">that people focused on truth very often</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.390" end="01:07:10.420" style="s2">they try to do things through the truth</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.710" end="01:07:11.560" style="s2">channel it doesn&#39;t work as well as doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.420" end="01:07:15.400" style="s2">it through the ritual and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.560" end="01:07:19.540" style="s2">channels it&#39;s interesting that mcfuzz</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.400" end="01:07:22.810" style="s2">are used for conversion - yeah right and</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.540" end="01:07:25.990" style="s2">born as it you well and another thing if</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.810" end="01:07:30.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever read what prayers we say on</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.990" end="01:07:33.250" style="s2">Yom Kippur the Day of Atonement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.520" end="01:07:35.050" style="s2">terrifying because you sort of start by</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.250" end="01:07:38.980" style="s2">atoning for your sins and then you get</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.050" end="01:07:40.540" style="s2">into we are sorry for pretending to</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.980" end="01:07:42.550" style="s2">atone for our sins when actually we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.540" end="01:07:48.100" style="s2">not really sorry at all you know just</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.550" end="01:07:50.320" style="s2">like holy cow that&#39;s written in so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.100" end="01:07:53.080" style="s2">think that the idea that we can step</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.320" end="01:07:56.560" style="s2">away from being so concerned with the</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.080" end="01:07:58.869" style="s2">truth and move over to you know ritual</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.560" end="01:08:01.420" style="s2">and meaning and something else it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.869" end="01:08:03.850" style="s2">it&#39;s as though you can step outside of</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.420" end="01:08:06.250" style="s2">thinking and do something else with your</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.850" end="01:08:08.080" style="s2">mind than thinking like and my view is</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.250" end="01:08:11.740" style="s2">there&#39;s only thinking there isn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.080" end="01:08:12.940" style="s2">other operation there are other things</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.740" end="01:08:13.540" style="s2">that happen like there are other things</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.940" end="01:08:16.150" style="s2">that happen too</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.540" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">brain right but there&#39;s only kind of one</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.150" end="01:08:25.450" style="s2">thing you can do with your mind and</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:27.700" style="s2">there is no way to not care about truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.450" end="01:08:31.660" style="s2">even in your dreams don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.700" end="01:08:34.420" style="s2">truth in no way if you asked when when</p>

<p begin="01:08:34.420" end="01:08:39.339" style="s2">the end and there was an issue about how</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.270" end="01:08:41.230" style="s2">does a final theory of everything affect</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.339" end="01:08:43.660" style="s2">our concepts of ourselves Yeah right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.230" end="01:08:45.160" style="s2">I said to him you know at some point the</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.660" end="01:08:47.190" style="s2">hard thing is to conceive of what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.160" end="01:08:50.020" style="s2">mean by a theory of everything because</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.190" end="01:08:51.460" style="s2">there&#39;s that which is left undone in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.020" end="01:08:53.380" style="s2">theory of everything and it usually</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.460" end="01:08:55.540" style="s2">would what I believe it means is that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.380" end="01:08:57.430" style="s2">are no longer searching for mathematical</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.540" end="01:08:59.530" style="s2">improvements at that point but searching</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.430" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">for something ineffable some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.530" end="01:09:05.980" style="s2">gossamer that we can&#39;t touch without</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:07.960" style="s2">disintegrating at our touch or you you</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.980" end="01:09:09.970" style="s2">know this issue of what is the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.960" end="01:09:11.319" style="s2">of life and to the extent that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.970" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">able to try to distill it into a</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.319" end="01:09:15.970" style="s2">sentence that doesn&#39;t crumble on me I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:20.190" style="s2">said that the meaning of life to me is</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.970" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">the struggle to impart meaning - meaning</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.190" end="01:09:27.760" style="s2">and as soon the reason I constructed it</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:29.650" style="s2">that way is that if you just say that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.760" end="01:09:31.780" style="s2">you&#39;re a hundred percent clear look even</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.650" end="01:09:33.790" style="s2">on what that means then you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.780" end="01:09:35.170" style="s2">struggling and so as soon as the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.790" end="01:09:36.609" style="s2">struggle disappears the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.170" end="01:09:39.069" style="s2">disappears on the other hand if you say</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.609" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">there is no meaning to life you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.069" end="01:09:42.250" style="s2">the Shakespeare quote about sound and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.960" end="01:09:44.950" style="s2">fury signifying nothing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.250" end="01:09:46.750" style="s2">then you&#39;ve also lost the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.950" end="01:09:49.089" style="s2">life because you&#39;ve sort of crapped out</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.750" end="01:09:51.280" style="s2">of the game and so it&#39;s only the active</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.089" end="01:09:55.600" style="s2">part of turning this thing over in your</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.280" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">mind that keeps us animated I think</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.600" end="01:10:00.280" style="s2">there have to be completion points even</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:02.260" style="s2">if they&#39;re provisional that is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.280" end="01:10:04.210" style="s2">think it can just be struggle like</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.260" end="01:10:08.280" style="s2">because the short version of your answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.210" end="01:10:13.600" style="s2">is the meaning of life is struggle no</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.280" end="01:10:15.850" style="s2">without qualification yeah it is the it</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.600" end="01:10:18.490" style="s2">is it&#39;s a struggle to impart meaning -</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.850" end="01:10:20.740" style="s2">right it&#39;s a particular aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.490" end="01:10:23.350" style="s2">struggle okay but my point is the genus</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.740" end="01:10:26.680" style="s2">is struggle right correct which is like</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.350" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">something kinetic right</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.680" end="01:10:37.510" style="s2">emotion necessarily if I&#39;m struggling to</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:39.970" style="s2">pry the top off of a ketchup bottle</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.510" end="01:10:41.380" style="s2">there can be a static moment where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.970" end="01:10:45.010" style="s2">simply putting pressure and there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.380" end="01:10:46.210" style="s2">much kinetic there and metaphorically I</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.010" end="01:10:49.420" style="s2">mean obviously it&#39;s not really about</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.210" end="01:10:53.110" style="s2">ketchup right but like like even if</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.420" end="01:10:55.450" style="s2">there isn&#39;t in order imagine you just</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.110" end="01:10:57.730" style="s2">saw a frozen picture of you like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.450" end="01:10:58.840" style="s2">with the bottle right even if your</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.730" end="01:11:00.220" style="s2">muscles were tensed</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.840" end="01:11:02.650" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t know whether you were</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.220" end="01:11:04.180" style="s2">trying to get the top on take it off or</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.650" end="01:11:07.810" style="s2">just keep it the way that it was right</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.180" end="01:11:10.240" style="s2">struggle is in a way diachronic and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.810" end="01:11:11.590" style="s2">can see the struggle through a longer by</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.240" end="01:11:13.300" style="s2">the way every time you say diachronic</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.590" end="01:11:21.430" style="s2">the next time we meet we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.300" end="01:11:26.970" style="s2">drink I love that this conversation is</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.430" end="01:11:29.350" style="s2">going incredibly well um so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.970" end="01:11:31.150" style="s2">look there&#39;s this problem something else</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.350" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">you said in your conversation with Rabbi</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.150" end="01:11:35.050" style="s2">well P was that you hate when people say</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:38.790" style="s2">that happiness is the meaning of life so</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.050" end="01:11:41.710" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say that I think happiness is</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.790" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">I think it&#39;s true but I think the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.710" end="01:11:45.580" style="s2">obvious there&#39;s no other answer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:47.080" style="s2">completely trivial truth no one can</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.580" end="01:11:49.060" style="s2">disagree with this one um</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.080" end="01:11:51.450" style="s2">because so because of something I would</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.060" end="01:11:54.580" style="s2">call the value deferral problem okay so</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.450" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">and I think this is like the number one</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.580" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">ethical insight of the ancient world</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:12:01.480" style="s2">it&#39;s super simple okay which is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:05.140" style="s2">like it&#39;s something like this like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.480" end="01:12:07.840" style="s2">value of my life my life yeah can never</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.140" end="01:12:09.220" style="s2">be somehow something outside of me</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.840" end="01:12:11.320" style="s2">something to be found outside of me so</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.220" end="01:12:13.270" style="s2">like I mean suppose like okay here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.320" end="01:12:15.040" style="s2">thing that Aristotle considers a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.270" end="01:12:16.720" style="s2">of possibilities for like what a really</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.040" end="01:12:18.280" style="s2">good life looks like yeah the most</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.720" end="01:12:19.810" style="s2">interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.280" end="01:12:22.510" style="s2">possibilities that he considers is one</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.810" end="01:12:23.620" style="s2">that he leaves out he&#39;d so nowhere he oh</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.510" end="01:12:26.860" style="s2">he has that the of the life of money</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.620" end="01:12:29.020" style="s2">making life of honor the life of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.860" end="01:12:30.790" style="s2">intellectual life the the political life</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.020" end="01:12:32.260" style="s2">etc it goes on but one thing he does not</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.790" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">consider is like what about altruism</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.260" end="01:12:35.980" style="s2">okay what are the altruistic life like</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:36.460" style="s2">suppose that I say the entire point of</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.980" end="01:12:38.530" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.460" end="01:12:40.430" style="s2">right it&#39;s make you happy I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.530" end="01:12:43.370" style="s2">altruist</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.430" end="01:12:44.990" style="s2">that is that what it means well let me</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.370" end="01:12:46.810" style="s2">give that as an int alright I write it</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.990" end="01:12:48.620" style="s2">right if that is an instance</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.810" end="01:12:50.450" style="s2">suppose you&#39;re an actress too though</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.620" end="01:12:52.310" style="s2">right it&#39;s okay so you go and you make</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.450" end="01:12:53.690" style="s2">someone else happy right you just double</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.310" end="01:12:55.940" style="s2">the number of counterfactuals I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.690" end="01:12:58.070" style="s2">entertaining I&#39;m gonna keep going yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.940" end="01:13:00.230" style="s2">okay here&#39;s here&#39;s here&#39;s what why</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.070" end="01:13:03.080" style="s2">Arizona didn&#39;t consider the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.230" end="01:13:07.250" style="s2">of that right as a good life is that as</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.080" end="01:13:08.750" style="s2">an altruist sounds like deferring the</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.250" end="01:13:09.980" style="s2">problem of the meaning of my life on to</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.750" end="01:13:11.570" style="s2">you and I&#39;m like well the point is like</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.980" end="01:13:14.150" style="s2">the point is that Erik be happy right</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.570" end="01:13:15.650" style="s2">and suppose you differ also right to</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.150" end="01:13:17.780" style="s2">somebody else it&#39;s like we can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.650" end="01:13:19.910" style="s2">deferring somewhere along line someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.780" end="01:13:22.490" style="s2">actually got to do the happying right</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.910" end="01:13:24.260" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s got to be me who does</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.490" end="01:13:26.540" style="s2">it for my life it&#39;s not my children it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.260" end="01:13:28.580" style="s2">not my students no one can do the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.540" end="01:13:30.740" style="s2">meaning of my life for me and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.580" end="01:13:33.200" style="s2">just what sort of ancient you diamond</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.740" end="01:13:35.420" style="s2">ISM is is the realization that the Hat</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.200" end="01:13:37.910" style="s2">that the value of someone&#39;s life has to</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.420" end="01:13:39.890" style="s2">come home to them and be available to</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.910" end="01:13:42.260" style="s2">them in the form of something like an</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.890" end="01:13:44.990" style="s2">experience something you know not that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.260" end="01:13:46.090" style="s2">pleasure but no one I mean no one none</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.990" end="01:13:48.560" style="s2">people thought was pleasure but</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.090" end="01:13:50.570" style="s2">something that is in a way transparent</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.560" end="01:13:53.660" style="s2">to them and available to them as meaning</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.570" end="01:13:55.940" style="s2">as an experience and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.660" end="01:13:57.530" style="s2">word happiness is supposed to capture at</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.940" end="01:13:59.000" style="s2">least insofar as it&#39;s say a translation</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.530" end="01:14:07.190" style="s2">of the Greek like a diamond eeeh</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.000" end="01:14:09.860" style="s2">right so so like and I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.190" end="01:14:12.920" style="s2">struggle is kind of another way to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.860" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">into a worrisome deferral problem right</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.920" end="01:14:16.880" style="s2">like you&#39;re always struggling and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:19.430" style="s2">thing never happens they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.880" end="01:14:23.870" style="s2">where do we know if the meaning is the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.430" end="01:14:25.910" style="s2">struggle yeah but no there is so much</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.870" end="01:14:27.650" style="s2">work to do and there&#39;s so many partial</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.910" end="01:14:29.120" style="s2">you know to your point where you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.650" end="01:14:31.010" style="s2">say the word milestone but I think what</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.120" end="01:14:33.500" style="s2">you talked about his partial completions</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.010" end="01:14:35.780" style="s2">on the roof right so there are so many</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.500" end="01:14:37.190" style="s2">milestones and partial completions that</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.780" end="01:14:39.890" style="s2">are part of the struggle I would never</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.190" end="01:14:43.850" style="s2">wish to suggest that it&#39;s just pure has</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.890" end="01:14:46.130" style="s2">Sisyphean pointless struggle well you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.850" end="01:14:47.840" style="s2">defined it as a struggle so you can</p>

<p begin="01:14:53.820" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">completions okay I mean I guess I I</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.179" end="01:15:08.579" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t hear that as implicit like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:09.869" style="s2">is to me the arrival somewhere like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.579" end="01:15:12.510" style="s2">like there&#39;s going somewhere and then</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.510" end="01:15:19.770" style="s2">arriving and this idea that the journey</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.760" end="01:15:22.849" style="s2">is what&#39;s important never makes sense to</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.770" end="01:15:26.280" style="s2">me right but I think your definition</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.849" end="01:15:28.199" style="s2">suggests that that the definition that</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.280" end="01:15:30.449" style="s2">the meaning of life is the struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.199" end="01:15:35.699" style="s2">impart meaning meaning is a version of</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.449" end="01:15:38.969" style="s2">the journey view in long but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.699" end="01:15:40.500" style="s2">that life is one airline long airline</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.969" end="01:15:45.270" style="s2">flight with no landings or takeoffs</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.500" end="01:15:47.099" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really enter into that well so I</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.270" end="01:15:49.469" style="s2">get that like you don&#39;t think that but</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.099" end="01:15:51.150" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is you&#39;re saying that so</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.469" end="01:15:53.010" style="s2">so there&#39;s like there&#39;s like how you</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.150" end="01:15:54.119" style="s2">view life and then there&#39;s the way that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.010" end="01:15:56.460" style="s2">you have a particular weird with like</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.119" end="01:15:59.070" style="s2">act academic support footnotes so</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.460" end="01:16:00.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a footnote on that yeah okay but</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.070" end="01:16:01.710" style="s2">I actually want you to bring the</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.060" end="01:16:06.420" style="s2">footnote up it in the main text oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.710" end="01:16:09.389" style="s2">by your definition and say that you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.420" end="01:16:11.070" style="s2">the pursuit of meaning essentially</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.389" end="01:16:13.500" style="s2">involves these two components that are</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.070" end="01:16:14.790" style="s2">actually really hard to fit together and</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.500" end="01:16:17.369" style="s2">this is one of those distinctions we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.790" end="01:16:19.860" style="s2">gonna need to like back up right to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.369" end="01:16:23.610" style="s2">able to cash that check but it involves</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.860" end="01:16:26.070" style="s2">both the you know a kind of movement a</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.610" end="01:16:29.400" style="s2">kind of struggle towards something like</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.070" end="01:16:31.889" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m putting meaning a</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.400" end="01:16:33.389" style="s2">meaning or understanding or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.889" end="01:16:35.369" style="s2">there&#39;s more than one a kind of endpoint</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.389" end="01:16:37.500" style="s2">um and then and then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.369" end="01:16:39.659" style="s2">like being at the endpoint right and</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.500" end="01:16:41.520" style="s2">there has to be a what it is like to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.659" end="01:16:44.190" style="s2">at the endpoint and that has to be part</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.520" end="01:16:44.969" style="s2">of what the meaning of life is what</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.190" end="01:16:46.739" style="s2">happened let me give you a little</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.969" end="01:16:49.230" style="s2">completion story that actually made a</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.739" end="01:16:51.750" style="s2">huge difference in my life you ever</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.230" end="01:16:53.429" style="s2">heard somebody say when you complain</p>

<p begin="01:16:53.429" end="01:16:58.260" style="s2">somebody says well what&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.290" end="01:17:00.329" style="s2">common factor to the 7 problematic</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.260" end="01:17:02.460" style="s2">relationships you just described you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.329" end="01:17:04.500" style="s2">supposed to say it&#39;s me isn&#39;t it right</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.460" end="01:17:06.480" style="s2">right okay so I was going around and</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.500" end="01:17:07.820" style="s2">saying to a close friend of mine named</p>

<p begin="01:17:07.820" end="01:17:12.770" style="s2">I keep having the following bizarre</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.770" end="01:17:18.610" style="s2">clearly me he said no not in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.790" end="01:17:21.050" style="s2">that you mean it I said what do you mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.610" end="01:17:23.810" style="s2">he said look I know you very well</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.050" end="01:17:26.420" style="s2">and you&#39;re imagining that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.810" end="01:17:29.000" style="s2">something really wrong he said in fact</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.420" end="01:17:30.440" style="s2">think about a different problem you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.000" end="01:17:32.840" style="s2">got someone with a compromised immune</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.440" end="01:17:34.880" style="s2">system they&#39;re the only person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.840" end="01:17:37.610" style="s2">actually seeing the world of pathogens</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.880" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">correctly because they&#39;re actually not</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.610" end="01:17:42.110" style="s2">defended against the pathogens everyone</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:44.090" style="s2">with a non compromised immune system is</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.110" end="01:17:45.710" style="s2">oblivious to what&#39;s actually going on in</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.090" end="01:17:47.420" style="s2">their environment he says the problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.710" end="01:17:50.120" style="s2">that you have is that you&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.420" end="01:17:51.800" style="s2">guy who isn&#39;t oblivious to the problems</p>

<p begin="01:17:51.800" end="01:17:56.000" style="s2">because for whatever reason you do not</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.050" end="01:17:58.340" style="s2">have the immune system that the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:59.390" style="s2">us carry implicitly so did that extent</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.340" end="01:18:00.950" style="s2">if you want to say that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.390" end="01:18:03.110" style="s2">you&#39;re doing wrong but that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.950" end="01:18:05.330" style="s2">bad example because the pathogens are</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.110" end="01:18:07.670" style="s2">real they&#39;re not imagined okay that</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.330" end="01:18:09.050" style="s2">totally changed my life it completely</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.670" end="01:18:12.230" style="s2">reframed something I thought I</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.050" end="01:18:15.050" style="s2">effectively had a de facto proof of one</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.230" end="01:18:17.330" style="s2">thing and somebody&#39;s better insight came</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.050" end="01:18:18.890" style="s2">in and made my life much richer and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.330" end="01:18:20.750" style="s2">stopped worrying about that particular</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.890" end="01:18:24.230" style="s2">problem now I could move on to the next</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.750" end="01:18:26.360" style="s2">problem that&#39;s an example of a milestone</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.230" end="01:18:30.160" style="s2">of completion I never had to go back</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.360" end="01:18:33.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a very durable insight okay</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.160" end="01:18:34.610" style="s2">that is part of the struggle to impart</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.140" end="01:18:37.220" style="s2">meaning to meeting to get to these</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.610" end="01:18:38.990" style="s2">higher forms where you&#39;re not trapped in</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.220" end="01:18:40.940" style="s2">the same problems that everyone else has</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.990" end="01:18:43.970" style="s2">it gives you an ability to teach to</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.940" end="01:18:45.530" style="s2">share to give paradigms and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.970" end="01:18:46.310" style="s2">think that they&#39;re tied to personality</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.530" end="01:18:48.920" style="s2">so one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.310" end="01:18:51.740" style="s2">important to me for example and I talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.920" end="01:18:53.990" style="s2">about it a lot on this show I think or</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.740" end="01:18:56.630" style="s2">in other interviews is the fact that in</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.990" end="01:18:59.810" style="s2">mathematics we honor our Nazis that</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.630" end="01:19:02.600" style="s2">there were Nazis who contributed major</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.810" end="01:19:05.000" style="s2">insights and it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.600" end="01:19:06.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not sons of bitches but the part</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.000" end="01:19:09.440" style="s2">of them that contribute mathematical and</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.800" end="01:19:13.160" style="s2">physical insight is not compromised by</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.440" end="01:19:14.810" style="s2">their goddamn evil Nazism those</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.160" end="01:19:20.030" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.810" end="01:19:20.960" style="s2">so the ability to divorce to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.030" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">the human</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.960" end="01:19:24.620" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any choice in mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.880" end="01:19:26.330" style="s2">if somebody finds something essential</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.620" end="01:19:28.550" style="s2">and that person happens to be a</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.330" end="01:19:30.980" style="s2">son-of-a-bitch you don&#39;t have the right</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.550" end="01:19:33.680" style="s2">to edit that person out of history</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.980" end="01:19:39.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s inconvenient for you that</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.680" end="01:19:42.530" style="s2">that happened right so I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.140" end="01:19:44.570" style="s2">the moral failings of the people who do</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.530" end="01:19:48.020" style="s2">the teachings should be assumed by the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.570" end="01:19:50.239" style="s2">students now the key question is do</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.020" end="01:19:52.700" style="s2">those moral failings compromise let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.239" end="01:19:54.860" style="s2">say the the teachings themselves in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.700" end="01:19:57.230" style="s2">cases they do particularly comes from a</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.860" end="01:19:58.969" style="s2">point of sanctimony if the teacher has</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.230" end="01:20:00.920" style="s2">not struggled as much as the student</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.969" end="01:20:05.390" style="s2">then in fact the relationship maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.920" end="01:20:07.130" style="s2">would be more profitable if reversed but</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.390" end="01:20:08.840" style="s2">I think it matters a lot so here the</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.130" end="01:20:10.370" style="s2">theoretical practical divide is really</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.840" end="01:20:12.590" style="s2">helping you out because I think that</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.370" end="01:20:14.150" style="s2">mathematics is very squarely theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.590" end="01:20:16.250" style="s2">and the more we move towards the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.150" end="01:20:19.550" style="s2">theoretical the easier it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.250" end="01:20:21.020" style="s2">to make that kind of divorce a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.550" end="01:20:27.260" style="s2">people would find it harder with music</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.020" end="01:20:29.120" style="s2">my mom is very torn about vogner it look</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.260" end="01:20:30.560" style="s2">for me the very hardest case and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.120" end="01:20:32.750" style="s2">one that I personally struggled with is</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.560" end="01:20:38.060" style="s2">Aristotle so I think that Aristotle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.750" end="01:20:40.850" style="s2">views on like women and natural slavery</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.060" end="01:20:42.350" style="s2">are deeply embedded in his ethical</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.850" end="01:20:44.390" style="s2">theories so I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.350" end="01:20:46.520" style="s2">like some kind of little extra bit that</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.390" end="01:20:48.860" style="s2">you can just ignore those they&#39;re ways</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.520" end="01:20:50.930" style="s2">in which something is infected with the</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.860" end="01:20:52.850" style="s2">problem and you have to refactor the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.930" end="01:20:54.890" style="s2">teaching it&#39;s it&#39;s and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.850" end="01:20:56.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s that it&#39;s like even what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.890" end="01:20:57.469" style="s2">even connected to what&#39;s good about the</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.270" end="01:20:58.880" style="s2">teaching there were years when I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.469" end="01:21:00.020" style="s2">teach it for this exact reason like</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.880" end="01:21:01.460" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just morally corrupt and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.020" end="01:21:04.010" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t teach it I came to think</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.460" end="01:21:05.660" style="s2">differently about it but my point is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.010" end="01:21:08.360" style="s2">question of like how should we deal with</p>

<p begin="01:21:13.160" end="01:21:17.239" style="s2">question what kind of thing do they have</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.380" end="01:21:18.680" style="s2">to teach us how theoretical is it how</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.239" end="01:21:19.969" style="s2">practical is it are they they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.860" end="01:21:28.820" style="s2">is almost given that you don&#39;t know as</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.870" end="01:21:31.219" style="s2">literary device in other words are they</p>

<p begin="01:21:36.920" end="01:21:39.770" style="s2">like and like in some sense like with</p>

<p begin="01:21:56.120" end="01:22:02.719" style="s2">case but I I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.659" end="01:22:04.219" style="s2">single answer here like that is I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.719" end="01:22:05.780" style="s2">that the theoretical practical divide</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.219" end="01:22:08.030" style="s2">makes a big difference and in a way the</p>

<p begin="01:22:21.199" end="01:22:28.909" style="s2">view about it but I also like the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.170" end="01:22:31.100" style="s2">question that&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.909" end="01:22:34.610" style="s2">question right because that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.100" end="01:22:35.960" style="s2">question about there&#39;s some knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.610" end="01:22:37.280" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the source of that</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.960" end="01:22:39.550" style="s2">knowledge we have a different set of</p>

<p begin="01:22:48.440" end="01:22:53.360" style="s2">thing that to me is important in asking</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.360" end="01:22:56.360" style="s2">myself that question is like about this</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.360" end="01:23:00.620" style="s2">sort of question like it&#39;s why I raised</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.360" end="01:23:02.719" style="s2">the Aristotle case it&#39;s a kind of faux</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.620" end="01:23:04.760" style="s2">deliberation that I would be engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.719" end="01:23:06.489" style="s2">because no one is ever going to come to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.760" end="01:23:08.390" style="s2">me and be like should we tear this down</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.489" end="01:23:10.310" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to start this campaign</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.390" end="01:23:14.719" style="s2">because I&#39;m really getting tired of</p>

<p begin="01:23:28.699" end="01:23:33.770" style="s2">I&#39;ve chosen hypocrisy as a life strategy</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.550" end="01:23:36.020" style="s2">is is that it offered the greatest</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.770" end="01:23:40.390" style="s2">benefits per unit of responsibility of</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.020" end="01:23:43.730" style="s2">all major philosophies all right okay</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.390" end="01:23:45.800" style="s2">I&#39;m always troubled when people tell me</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.730" end="01:23:47.080" style="s2">that hypocrisy is terrible</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.800" end="01:23:49.600" style="s2">now I</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.080" end="01:23:51.220" style="s2">to minimize my hypocrisy so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.600" end="01:23:53.290" style="s2">think it&#39;s you wooden struggle to</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.290" end="01:23:57.840" style="s2">struggles to maximize it because like</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.630" end="01:24:00.580" style="s2">what a great deal right but the the</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.840" end="01:24:03.070" style="s2">supervisory capacity within me is sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.580" end="01:24:04.930" style="s2">of it&#39;s an embarrassment of riches by</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.070" end="01:24:07.870" style="s2">embracing hypocrisy that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.930" end="01:24:09.790" style="s2">world becomes your candy store so that</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.870" end="01:24:11.410" style="s2">distinction between it I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.790" end="01:24:12.970" style="s2">interrupt between the it and that like</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.410" end="01:24:14.020" style="s2">that&#39;s one of those faux distinctions</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.970" end="01:24:15.160" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think you have a right to</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.020" end="01:24:17.080" style="s2">in the sense that I think you&#39;re one</p>

<p begin="01:24:17.080" end="01:24:23.410" style="s2">dear sweet child so it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.680" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">struggle with your own hypocrisy and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.410" end="01:24:26.440" style="s2">try to minimize it because you think</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:30.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with hypocrisy I</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.440" end="01:24:33.520" style="s2">don&#39;t love my hypocrisy in one region of</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.940" end="01:24:36.490" style="s2">my mind in other regions of my mind I</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.520" end="01:24:38.050" style="s2">certainly enjoy my hypocrisy I love</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.490" end="01:24:41.050" style="s2">steak dinners and if I actually think</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.050" end="01:24:43.660" style="s2">about what you know what what veal is it</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.050" end="01:24:45.400" style="s2">changes the enjoyment of veal because</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.660" end="01:24:48.070" style="s2">veal is pretty sick thing to to really</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.400" end="01:24:50.260" style="s2">take pleasure from to be blunt right and</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.070" end="01:24:51.940" style="s2">so there&#39;s this issue you know when I</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.260" end="01:24:53.530" style="s2">bring this up is in Cambridge</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.940" end="01:24:54.640" style="s2">Massachusetts there&#39;s a store in North</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.530" end="01:24:57.130" style="s2">Cambridge I think it says like</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.640" end="01:24:59.590" style="s2">fresh-killed poultry and it&#39;s just there</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.130" end="01:25:01.090" style="s2">on its advertising what it is and if</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.590" end="01:25:02.830" style="s2">you&#39;re buying from that store you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.090" end="01:25:04.330" style="s2">pretty much not going to have the the</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.830" end="01:25:05.470" style="s2">shock when you actually think about what</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.330" end="01:25:07.120" style="s2">it is that you&#39;re consuming because you</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.470" end="01:25:10.570" style="s2">bought it with that kind of thought in</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.120" end="01:25:11.980" style="s2">mind so there&#39;s this issue about you</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.570" end="01:25:13.570" style="s2">know obviously when I when I what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.980" end="01:25:16.120" style="s2">saying that I&#39;m a hypocrite in that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.570" end="01:25:18.580" style="s2">embraced as a philosophy there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.120" end="01:25:22.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a playful aspect to it which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.580" end="01:25:23.830" style="s2">that I&#39;m recognizing that most people</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.060" end="01:25:25.420" style="s2">don&#39;t see their own hypocrisy they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.830" end="01:25:28.300" style="s2">structured to see it in others and not</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.420" end="01:25:30.580" style="s2">in themselves it&#39;s a very easy teaching</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.300" end="01:25:32.440" style="s2">to just walk around watching for your</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.580" end="01:25:34.000" style="s2">own hypocrisy and then you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.440" end="01:25:36.520" style="s2">make yourself sick before pointing the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.000" end="01:25:38.860" style="s2">finger at other people what is very odd</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.520" end="01:25:41.890" style="s2">to me is how few people are aware of how</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.860" end="01:25:46.120" style="s2">deep their own hypocrisy is and then to</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.890" end="01:25:48.640" style="s2">lead a naive rallying cry of you know I</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.120" end="01:25:51.910" style="s2">can&#39;t believe this is this hypocrisy in</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.640" end="01:25:54.040" style="s2">in other people it&#39;s shocking to not</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.910" end="01:25:56.590" style="s2">have an idea of what baseline hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.040" end="01:25:58.720" style="s2">is based on yourself seems a bit rich I</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.590" end="01:26:00.460" style="s2">think you&#39;re the true crusader against</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.720" end="01:26:02.050" style="s2">hypocrisy we in some weird way</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.460" end="01:26:04.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s tends to be institutional</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.050" end="01:26:07.180" style="s2">hypocrisy in other words the the the</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.000" end="01:26:10.210" style="s2">thing that really bothers me if we had a</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.180" end="01:26:12.130" style="s2">2x2 grid there&#39;s individual versus</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.210" end="01:26:14.140" style="s2">individual conflicts there&#39;s institution</p>

<p begin="01:26:27.969" end="01:26:33.400" style="s2">always try what if the institution is</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.150" end="01:26:36.940" style="s2">right and the individual is wrong well</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.400" end="01:26:38.320" style="s2">then I don&#39;t view that as being a that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:27:12.420" end="01:27:16.360" style="s2">hypocritical institutions are different</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.620" end="01:27:18.580" style="s2">from hypocritical individuals yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.360" end="01:27:21.310" style="s2">like you know you you brought up the</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.580" end="01:27:25.800" style="s2">arch case right and so through the thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.310" end="01:27:27.850" style="s2">that I really don&#39;t like is like when a</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.800" end="01:27:29.469" style="s2">question is posed but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.850" end="01:27:32.050" style="s2">masquerading as a point or something</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.469" end="01:27:33.580" style="s2">else right so it&#39;s like I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.050" end="01:27:34.989" style="s2">totally willing to deliberate about</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.580" end="01:27:37.330" style="s2">whether or not we should take this arch</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.989" end="01:27:39.700" style="s2">down but that wasn&#39;t really why you</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.330" end="01:27:41.440" style="s2">raised it right why don&#39;t I raise it do</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.700" end="01:27:43.989" style="s2">you think um I think you raised it as a</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:45.400" style="s2">potential point of inconsistency um but</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.989" end="01:27:46.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t know when I think about the arch</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.400" end="01:27:48.940" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.450" end="01:27:50.650" style="s2">whether or not to to the fact that if I</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.940" end="01:27:54.160" style="s2">did an interesting question means that</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.650" end="01:27:56.440" style="s2">you are not convinced that it that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.160" end="01:27:57.670" style="s2">question is settled correct right that</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.440" end="01:27:59.020" style="s2">was sort of my point about all the cases</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.670" end="01:28:00.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t think there is one way to say I</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.020" end="01:28:02.469" style="s2">understand I deal with a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.880" end="01:28:06.250" style="s2">who find that these things are settled</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.469" end="01:28:07.870" style="s2">right then but but see that&#39;s my point</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.250" end="01:28:09.340" style="s2">you wanted to know maybe whether I find</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.870" end="01:28:11.650" style="s2">the question to be settled or not right</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.340" end="01:28:13.929" style="s2">and so you asked me a question should we</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.650" end="01:28:15.310" style="s2">tear down Sartre not and your design</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.929" end="01:28:16.390" style="s2">and ask you man that question was maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.310" end="01:28:18.100" style="s2">to figure out whether I thought a</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.390" end="01:28:19.390" style="s2">certain question was settled right but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.100" end="01:28:20.650" style="s2">think that&#39;s an actually a deliberative</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.390" end="01:28:23.830" style="s2">question like should we turn down the</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.650" end="01:28:25.270" style="s2">arch or not right and so what I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.830" end="01:28:26.440" style="s2">like and and and that&#39;s the distinction</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.270" end="01:28:29.199" style="s2">I drew between practical and theoretical</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.440" end="01:28:31.330" style="s2">but by doing that you&#39;re going to move</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.199" end="01:28:33.010" style="s2">it closer to the like when you say that</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.330" end="01:28:35.440" style="s2">something is a live question it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.010" end="01:28:36.460" style="s2">neutral frame which is I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.440" end="01:28:39.250" style="s2">interesting question I&#39;m not sure either</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.460" end="01:28:40.510" style="s2">way if I said to you what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.250" end="01:28:42.100" style="s2">about the violent overthrow of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.510" end="01:28:43.090" style="s2">United States and you were to say I</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.100" end="01:28:47.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.090" end="01:28:50.739" style="s2">that&#39;s a very strong statement yes to</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.920" end="01:28:54.550" style="s2">find it an interesting question right I</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.739" end="01:28:56.409" style="s2">think though that you know this goes</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.550" end="01:28:57.909" style="s2">deep into something like conversational</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.409" end="01:29:00.100" style="s2">trust but I could find almost anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.909" end="01:29:02.080" style="s2">to be an interesting question but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.100" end="01:29:03.790" style="s2">would need it would be pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.080" end="01:29:06.870" style="s2">to me that the person posed it to me as</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.790" end="01:29:08.949" style="s2">a question rather than as a test right</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.870" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">because sometimes questions aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.949" end="01:29:11.739" style="s2">questions that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:13.570" style="s2">parasitic about this you see you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.739" end="01:29:15.820" style="s2">have a society in which everybody finds</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.570" end="01:29:17.170" style="s2">whether the the violent overthrow of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.820" end="01:29:19.900" style="s2">United States is to be an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.170" end="01:29:21.550" style="s2">question in general the substrate that</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.900" end="01:29:23.199" style="s2">makes this country possible so that a</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.550" end="01:29:25.090" style="s2">few people can find that an entertaining</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.199" end="01:29:28.590" style="s2">question have to make sure that that</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.090" end="01:29:30.460" style="s2">question is in fact you Loutre I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.590" end="01:29:32.469" style="s2">with respect to that particular one I</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.460" end="01:29:34.060" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet seen the interest that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.469" end="01:29:35.260" style="s2">you you sold me on the interest of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.060" end="01:29:37.330" style="s2">previous one on the grounds of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.260" end="01:29:39.940" style="s2">discussion right on the face of it it</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.330" end="01:29:41.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t we haven&#39;t yet established the</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.940" end="01:29:42.280" style="s2">the grounds that might make it</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.140" end="01:29:45.280" style="s2">interesting with the destruction of</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.280" end="01:29:48.580" style="s2">Monticello like I I if I found things</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.280" end="01:29:52.600" style="s2">that you know had been built with slave</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.580" end="01:29:55.120" style="s2">labor right you know that I can start to</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.600" end="01:29:56.260" style="s2">create a great deal of destruction by</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.120" end="01:29:58.810" style="s2">opening up a lot of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.260" end="01:30:01.360" style="s2">questions there by moving the midpoint</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.810" end="01:30:03.040" style="s2">of the discussion quite a bit farther</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.360" end="01:30:06.969" style="s2">these are not in fact neutral this is</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.040" end="01:30:09.570" style="s2">part of why I find philosophy troubling</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.969" end="01:30:14.469" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t recognize often that</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.570" end="01:30:19.600" style="s2">the act of asking these questions is in</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.469" end="01:30:21.730" style="s2">fact a non neutral action if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.600" end="01:30:24.810" style="s2">remember the Dukakis question where</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.730" end="01:30:27.780" style="s2">there was a question about Willie Horton</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.810" end="01:30:30.210" style="s2">yet very vaguely okay I read the memory</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.780" end="01:30:31.650" style="s2">hole it&#39;s pretty amazing so I think he</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.210" end="01:30:34.020" style="s2">was asked a question about what should</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.650" end="01:30:36.270" style="s2">happen if somebody raped his wife yes</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.020" end="01:30:39.210" style="s2">yes that&#39;s right yes and in general the</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.270" end="01:30:40.650" style="s2">correct answer is I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.210" end="01:30:41.910" style="s2">answer that question and don&#39;t make me</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.650" end="01:30:43.470" style="s2">tell you a second time</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.910" end="01:30:45.600" style="s2">my wife is sitting right here right</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.470" end="01:30:47.070" style="s2">thank you very much I will not be</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.600" end="01:30:48.300" style="s2">entertaining that don&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.070" end="01:30:50.220" style="s2">mistake again sir</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.300" end="01:30:52.470" style="s2">right because the point is I don&#39;t wish</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.220" end="01:30:54.270" style="s2">to open it this up right now the</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.470" end="01:30:56.520" style="s2">philosophers impulses that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.270" end="01:30:58.500" style="s2">interesting question very often not if</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.520" end="01:31:01.020" style="s2">like sometimes you can tell that the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.500" end="01:31:02.430" style="s2">person asked it the test you mean not</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.020" end="01:31:04.290" style="s2">you mean if it wasn&#39;t asked I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.430" end="01:31:06.690" style="s2">saying that very often the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.290" end="01:31:08.940" style="s2">gambit is a pretend state in which we</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.690" end="01:31:12.240" style="s2">are quite comfortable entertaining</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.940" end="01:31:15.960" style="s2">anything you know oh yes let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.240" end="01:31:17.660" style="s2">that the Jain uses her steak knife to</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.960" end="01:31:20.100" style="s2">kill Billy across the table at the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.660" end="01:31:22.110" style="s2">Philosopher&#39;s dinner right and then you</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.100" end="01:31:24.060" style="s2">start talking about these all of these</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.110" end="01:31:25.860" style="s2">sorts of things in general this is again</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.060" end="01:31:27.630" style="s2">that there are no tough guys we all</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.860" end="01:31:30.120" style="s2">should have personal boundaries and</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.630" end="01:31:31.860" style="s2">limits in places where we wish to said I</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.120" end="01:31:33.420" style="s2">would prefer that that question not be</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.860" end="01:31:36.240" style="s2">asked because the question is itself is</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.420" end="01:31:38.280" style="s2">a form of violence so you say oh the</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.240" end="01:31:39.750" style="s2">philosopher has this pretend interest in</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.280" end="01:31:41.630" style="s2">curiosity but I would say the non</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.750" end="01:31:46.350" style="s2">philosopher has these pretend questions</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.630" end="01:31:48.540" style="s2">that they put before us and and then if</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.350" end="01:31:50.010" style="s2">we if we say back to them look there are</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.540" end="01:31:51.690" style="s2">circumstances under which that could be</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.010" end="01:31:54.690" style="s2">a real question if somebody were really</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.690" end="01:31:56.490" style="s2">asking me of it it of me and there is no</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.690" end="01:31:58.410" style="s2">question such that I could rule out in</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.490" end="01:32:01.140" style="s2">advance that anyone could honestly ask</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.410" end="01:32:03.510" style="s2">it of me in any conversation um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.140" end="01:32:05.670" style="s2">not the same thing as saying like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.510" end="01:32:07.320" style="s2">buying into your gambit and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.670" end="01:32:08.880" style="s2">answer your pretend question as though</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.320" end="01:32:10.080" style="s2">it were a real question and if I were to</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.880" end="01:32:11.790" style="s2">do that I would have to do it with</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.080" end="01:32:13.650" style="s2">pretend interest but let&#39;s talk about a</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.790" end="01:32:15.900" style="s2">situation in which a question that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.650" end="01:32:16.710" style="s2">should not have been asked too much in</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.900" end="01:32:18.840" style="s2">my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.710" end="01:32:21.690" style="s2">must now be asked because of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.840" end="01:32:24.060" style="s2">changing landscape so for example the</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.690" end="01:32:25.500" style="s2">Tesla problem which is that you might</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.060" end="01:32:27.630" style="s2">have thought trolley problems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.500" end="01:32:29.190" style="s2">bizarre and academic well now that you</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.630" end="01:32:31.020" style="s2">have to commit it to code and you have</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.190" end="01:32:33.510" style="s2">to say well what should i do how many</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.020" end="01:32:35.400" style="s2">baby carriages should I write okay</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.510" end="01:32:37.770" style="s2">that&#39;s an incredibly interesting</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.400" end="01:32:39.540" style="s2">situation where we can no longer a four</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.770" end="01:32:42.420" style="s2">to leave an expression unev alyou it</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.540" end="01:32:43.800" style="s2">exactly right so there there can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.420" end="01:32:45.570" style="s2">really be questions we can&#39;t ask cuz we</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.800" end="01:32:46.860" style="s2">might be in the situation my point is is</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.570" end="01:32:49.650" style="s2">that there can&#39;t be a question that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.860" end="01:32:51.870" style="s2">can&#39;t ask under any circumstances but</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.650" end="01:32:55.440" style="s2">that we may find that a question that</p>

<p begin="01:33:00.510" end="01:33:07.890" style="s2">circumstances have changed right right</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.120" end="01:33:11.720" style="s2">so right and um and a lot of I mean in</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.890" end="01:33:14.190" style="s2">that situation it might even be that I</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.720" end="01:33:15.720" style="s2">think what what will probably end up</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.190" end="01:33:18.030" style="s2">doing is trying to find a lot of ways to</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.720" end="01:33:19.860" style="s2">avoid exactly answering it right</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.030" end="01:33:21.240" style="s2">managing the situation in which the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.860" end="01:33:25.920" style="s2">question has been asked rather than</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.240" end="01:33:28.110" style="s2">answering it I mean I guess right these</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.920" end="01:33:30.120" style="s2">kind of like I thought we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.110" end="01:33:31.980" style="s2">self-driving cars away before now and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.120" end="01:33:34.410" style="s2">think we do right but we don&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.980" end="01:33:37.680" style="s2">because of these I thought we were going</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.410" end="01:33:40.650" style="s2">to get stuck here that having to commit</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.680" end="01:33:42.780" style="s2">things to code forces us to promote the</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.650" end="01:33:44.070" style="s2">consciousness and to responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.780" end="01:33:46.440" style="s2">things that we would prefer like I</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.070" end="01:33:48.510" style="s2">believe that one of the reasons that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.440" end="01:33:51.000" style="s2">tend to have more sex while drunk than</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.510" end="01:33:52.890" style="s2">than sober at least the early stages of</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.000" end="01:33:55.950" style="s2">relationship is because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.890" end="01:33:57.930" style="s2">actually interested in is an excuse and</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.950" end="01:34:00.450" style="s2">that we want to find an excuse which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.930" end="01:34:02.030" style="s2">I panicked you know that&#39;s a great thing</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.450" end="01:34:04.460" style="s2">to do behind the wheel I panicked</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.030" end="01:34:07.860" style="s2">everybody understands a momentary</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.460" end="01:34:10.470" style="s2">split-second decision to have a series</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.860" end="01:34:12.900" style="s2">of documented meetings in which we</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.470" end="01:34:15.020" style="s2">deliberated over this and then it plays</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.900" end="01:34:18.000" style="s2">out in an actual intersection somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.020" end="01:34:20.640" style="s2">you know in North Dakota and suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.000" end="01:34:22.620" style="s2">you know two baby carriages are taken</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.640" end="01:34:25.440" style="s2">out so that a collection of school</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.620" end="01:34:27.360" style="s2">children are spared right that situation</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.440" end="01:34:29.550" style="s2">is like well who made this decision and</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.360" end="01:34:31.110" style="s2">then it becomes a very thorny issue that</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.550" end="01:34:33.510" style="s2">we&#39;re not capable of it and we may</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.110" end="01:34:35.070" style="s2">choose to exist in an ignorant state and</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.510" end="01:34:36.540" style="s2">forgo the benefit of a technology</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.070" end="01:34:39.600" style="s2">because we can&#39;t bear to take</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.540" end="01:34:43.200" style="s2">responsibility deliberatively for what</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.600" end="01:34:46.920" style="s2">we what must commit to do right right</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.200" end="01:34:48.660" style="s2">and but there this question is exists at</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.920" end="01:34:50.930" style="s2">a lot of different levels right and so</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.660" end="01:34:53.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like one question is</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.930" end="01:34:55.610" style="s2">you know so you&#39;re right that we can</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.630" end="01:34:57.800" style="s2">hide behind the panic but like suppose</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.610" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">that I just had the time so many of</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.800" end="01:35:01.460" style="s2">these TV shows you know like 24 or</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.360" end="01:35:02.540" style="s2">whatever are about like cases worry</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.460" end="01:35:04.100" style="s2">again there&#39;s time pressure but the</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.540" end="01:35:06.340" style="s2">person has like a minute to think about</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.100" end="01:35:09.470" style="s2">it and they make a decision right and</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.340" end="01:35:14.150" style="s2">like I might have to make a decision and</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.470" end="01:35:17.060" style="s2">I think you know it it at least has to</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.150" end="01:35:19.250" style="s2">be possible for me not necessarily to</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.060" end="01:35:20.570" style="s2">approve of the decision I make even to</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.250" end="01:35:21.680" style="s2">be able to live with the decision I make</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.570" end="01:35:24.440" style="s2">but to accept the fact that I made a</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.680" end="01:35:25.490" style="s2">decision I think that has to be possible</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.440" end="01:35:27.860" style="s2">so it has to be possible for me to</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.490" end="01:35:29.420" style="s2">entertain the question but the question</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.860" end="01:35:31.490" style="s2">of whether we can as a society</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.420" end="01:35:33.410" style="s2">deliberate together about that question</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.490" end="01:35:34.970" style="s2">yeah and come up with sort of like an</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.410" end="01:35:36.770" style="s2">answer that we can then all live with</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.970" end="01:35:38.360" style="s2">and in some sense be governed by that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.770" end="01:35:40.040" style="s2">like a whole other level and there are</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.360" end="01:35:41.510" style="s2">many levels in between right well the</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.040" end="01:35:43.010" style="s2">question of should we deranged what it</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.510" end="01:35:45.500" style="s2">is that we know about the world so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.010" end="01:35:48.980" style="s2">we can live with the noble truth that</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.500" end="01:35:51.560" style="s2">may be foundational to our society you</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.980" end="01:35:53.300" style="s2">know if we came to understand cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.560" end="01:35:56.300" style="s2">noble truth or noble lies sorry noble</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.300" end="01:35:56.810" style="s2">lie right noble truths are easy yes</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.300" end="01:36:00.380" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.810" end="01:36:02.630" style="s2">thanks for no but like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.380" end="01:36:04.190" style="s2">disturbing to those of us who believe in</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.630" end="01:36:06.290" style="s2">evolutionary theory that people who</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.190" end="01:36:09.200" style="s2">claim to believe in systems of selective</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.290" end="01:36:10.790" style="s2">pressures are unable to accept the basic</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.200" end="01:36:12.770" style="s2">premise which is that they operate on</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.790" end="01:36:14.300" style="s2">systems with heredity variation in</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.770" end="01:36:17.240" style="s2">differential success and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.300" end="01:36:20.870" style="s2">differential success is the aspect by</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.240" end="01:36:23.720" style="s2">which one group you know carries an</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.870" end="01:36:25.460" style="s2">evolutionary advantage over another the</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.720" end="01:36:27.350" style="s2">idea that there should be evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.460" end="01:36:30.350" style="s2">advantages and disadvantages relative to</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.350" end="01:36:32.780" style="s2">different environments is toxic to many</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.350" end="01:36:34.700" style="s2">of the lies that we&#39;ve told ourselves to</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.780" end="01:36:37.160" style="s2">create the foundation of our society and</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.700" end="01:36:40.690" style="s2">so to be able to say well I absolutely I</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.160" end="01:36:43.610" style="s2">would never question Darwin&#39;s theory of</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.690" end="01:36:45.620" style="s2">selection however I also believe in all</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.610" end="01:36:48.320" style="s2">of the lies that are necessary and this</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.620" end="01:36:49.850" style="s2">is an unresolved conflict has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.320" end="01:36:52.370" style="s2">the partitioning of the mind I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.850" end="01:36:54.140" style="s2">how you could do it otherwise and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.370" end="01:36:56.510" style="s2">deep partition mind doesn&#39;t seem to be a</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.140" end="01:36:58.760" style="s2">healthy state I know that my friend sam</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.510" end="01:37:00.520" style="s2">Harris you know has this idea that he</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.760" end="01:37:03.020" style="s2">should have kind of a uniform</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.520" end="01:37:04.200" style="s2">interoperable access to all aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.020" end="01:37:07.200" style="s2">his mind but that seems like</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.200" end="01:37:09.750" style="s2">this to me I mean it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.200" end="01:37:12.120" style="s2">think like I should at any given time</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.750" end="01:37:14.220" style="s2">have access to all of it it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.120" end="01:37:18.080" style="s2">thing to think that with respect to any</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.220" end="01:37:20.880" style="s2">particular bit or I don&#39;t have access I</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.080" end="01:37:23.760" style="s2">can be sort of okay with that and be</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.880" end="01:37:26.550" style="s2">okay with the awareness of not having</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.760" end="01:37:28.560" style="s2">access like you can&#39;t just straight-up</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.550" end="01:37:30.110" style="s2">deceive yourself right you have to sort</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.560" end="01:37:32.940" style="s2">of deceive yourself behind your back</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.110" end="01:37:34.790" style="s2">that&#39;s not true I mean I can&#39;t say to</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.940" end="01:37:37.710" style="s2">myself like you go to synagogue</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.790" end="01:37:41.880" style="s2">sometimes okay don&#39;t you find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.710" end="01:37:43.050" style="s2">straight-up deceiving yourself let me</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.880" end="01:37:44.970" style="s2">give you an example what I mean by</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.050" end="01:37:48.750" style="s2">strips you mean you can see whether I</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.970" end="01:37:50.610" style="s2">would say no not but um but like suppose</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.750" end="01:37:52.980" style="s2">that you were like look I&#39;ll pay you a</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.610" end="01:37:57.210" style="s2">million dollars if you believe that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.980" end="01:37:59.070" style="s2">wearing like a red suit right um I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.210" end="01:38:00.450" style="s2">form that belief it would I would be so</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.070" end="01:38:03.750" style="s2">advantageous to me to believe it right</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.450" end="01:38:04.620" style="s2">but like I can&#39;t do I self believe it no</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.750" end="01:38:04.860" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work it doesn&#39;t work like</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.620" end="01:38:07.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.860" end="01:38:10.530" style="s2">right that&#39;s what I mean by I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.200" end="01:38:12.600" style="s2">deceive myself there&#39;s a kind of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.530" end="01:38:14.400" style="s2">a kind of fundamental will to truth that</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.600" end="01:38:18.060" style="s2">is just built into thinking and that I</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.400" end="01:38:19.710" style="s2">can&#39;t override manually so I could</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.060" end="01:38:21.330" style="s2">certainly come to believe that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.710" end="01:38:23.730" style="s2">wearing a red suit through very funny</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.330" end="01:38:25.140" style="s2">channels right I might even be able to</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.730" end="01:38:26.580" style="s2">take a pill if I knew a certain pill</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.140" end="01:38:27.780" style="s2">would induce in me that belief I could</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.580" end="01:38:29.130" style="s2">decide to take the pill and then take</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.780" end="01:38:31.250" style="s2">the pill right and that would be kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.130" end="01:38:33.120" style="s2">obscure way of coming to have the belief</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.250" end="01:38:35.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s why I meant by you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.120" end="01:38:37.650" style="s2">straight forwardly right</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.040" end="01:38:40.080" style="s2">you can indirectly I think and people do</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.650" end="01:38:41.970" style="s2">very few layers of indirection I think</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.080" end="01:38:44.760" style="s2">that&#39;s right but not with zero right</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.970" end="01:38:49.920" style="s2">that&#39;s it oh I like this point a lot um</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.760" end="01:38:54.120" style="s2">and and so I think that that like that</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.920" end="01:38:56.010" style="s2">limit is like a certain kind of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.120" end="01:38:57.360" style="s2">maybe where Sam Harris is like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.010" end="01:38:59.340" style="s2">certain kind or something that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.360" end="01:39:02.190" style="s2">about his position there is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.340" end="01:39:04.020" style="s2">a certain kind of thing I couldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:39:04.020" end="01:39:13.590" style="s2">myself of opacity and when I you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.040" end="01:39:15.450" style="s2">feel like the story that you told about</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.590" end="01:39:16.950" style="s2">the hierarchy case right and the way in</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.450" end="01:39:17.490" style="s2">which somebody sort of unraveled that</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.950" end="01:39:19.650" style="s2">for you there</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.490" end="01:39:21.600" style="s2">Mantic hierarchy right and brought it</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.650" end="01:39:25.830" style="s2">brought to your own understanding what</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.600" end="01:39:28.380" style="s2">was happening and gave you a it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.830" end="01:39:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s like shedding a light on yourself</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.380" end="01:39:37.440" style="s2">such that you now can can articulate it</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.740" end="01:39:40.590" style="s2">in a way that like makes sense to you</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.440" end="01:39:41.790" style="s2">right when we&#39;re not when we&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.590" end="01:39:43.380" style="s2">that position with respect to something</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.790" end="01:39:45.630" style="s2">it bothers us and when we get into that</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.380" end="01:39:50.070" style="s2">position that&#39;s a real and very</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.630" end="01:39:51.420" style="s2">significant kind of progress interesting</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.070" end="01:39:53.130" style="s2">let me ask you a different question</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.420" end="01:39:55.230" style="s2">that&#39;s been bugging me a lot yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.130" end="01:39:57.720" style="s2">think that the rauzein veil of ignorance</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.230" end="01:40:02.790" style="s2">is there&#39;s something terribly wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.720" end="01:40:06.060" style="s2">it and I see it as having an example of</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.790" end="01:40:07.980" style="s2">a piece of philosophy that is got a lot</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.060" end="01:40:10.170" style="s2">of purchase outside of philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.980" end="01:40:13.590" style="s2">departments and I&#39;m worried that it may</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.170" end="01:40:15.240" style="s2">be deranging us as a society that this</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.590" end="01:40:17.400" style="s2">idea that identity should somehow be</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.240" end="01:40:20.340" style="s2">fungible and we should say ok we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.400" end="01:40:23.670" style="s2">know who we&#39;re gonna come back as and in</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.340" end="01:40:25.950" style="s2">fact it means something very bizarre to</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.670" end="01:40:28.710" style="s2">say that we would come back as as the</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.950" end="01:40:31.920" style="s2">other is there something wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.710" end="01:40:33.780" style="s2">Rawls in which if we predicate too much</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.920" end="01:40:36.750" style="s2">and we we lean on that pillar too</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.780" end="01:40:37.380" style="s2">heavily we may do ourselves a great</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.750" end="01:40:42.120" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.380" end="01:40:43.980" style="s2">it&#39;s an intuition yeah so um I think yes</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.120" end="01:40:47.700" style="s2">actually I think I may be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.980" end="01:40:49.230" style="s2">I&#39;m somewhat in agreement with you let</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.700" end="01:40:54.840" style="s2">me tell you how I would put this problem</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.230" end="01:40:58.200" style="s2">to myself the rauzein move is a species</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.840" end="01:41:00.030" style="s2">of a genus of stepping back moves right</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.200" end="01:41:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like look there are these facts</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.030" end="01:41:05.730" style="s2">about you but you can imagine that they</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.640" end="01:41:08.190" style="s2">were not the case just abstract them</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.730" end="01:41:12.060" style="s2">away and now make your decision okay but</p>
<p begin="01:41:08.190" end="01:41:14.100" style="s2">um I assume you can do that that is my</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.060" end="01:41:16.800" style="s2">assume you have that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.100" end="01:41:21.270" style="s2">metacognition available to you right and</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.800" end="01:41:22.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like look look at Rawls and look at</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.270" end="01:41:25.470" style="s2">all the people that Rawls influenced and</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.890" end="01:41:28.170" style="s2">the rauzein tradition like there was</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.470" end="01:41:30.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a very characteristic</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.170" end="01:41:32.460" style="s2">set of say</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.170" end="01:41:34.380" style="s2">political and social and economic views</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.460" end="01:41:36.330" style="s2">that go along with those people and like</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.380" end="01:41:38.220" style="s2">did they really step did they abstract</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.330" end="01:41:39.960" style="s2">from those sufficiently in in in</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.220" end="01:41:47.070" style="s2">producing the theory like maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.960" end="01:41:48.690" style="s2">right and so I think that there is the</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.070" end="01:41:51.810" style="s2">at the very least there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.690" end="01:41:53.970" style="s2">assumption there that it is that it is</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.810" end="01:41:55.230" style="s2">possible and it may be possible it just</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.970" end="01:41:57.090" style="s2">may be that you can&#39;t do it so easily</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.230" end="01:41:58.410" style="s2">maybe that you can&#39;t do it merely by</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.090" end="01:41:59.400" style="s2">entertaining like a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.410" end="01:42:01.950" style="s2">or something like that it may be</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.400" end="01:42:03.150" style="s2">possible to really learn to abstract</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.950" end="01:42:04.860" style="s2">away certain parts of your identity</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.150" end="01:42:06.780" style="s2">through a lot of work right through a</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.860" end="01:42:08.550" style="s2">lot of cognitive work and through like</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.780" end="01:42:10.050" style="s2">experience and stuff that you do but the</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.550" end="01:42:13.380" style="s2">idea that you could do it just by</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.050" end="01:42:18.330" style="s2">entertaining a counterfactual I think is</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.380" end="01:42:20.490" style="s2">not right I&#39;m not sure exactly what the</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.330" end="01:42:21.930" style="s2">implications are of that I mean that is</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.490" end="01:42:23.130" style="s2">it seems to me that this problem is like</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.930" end="01:42:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s an instance of something more</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.130" end="01:42:31.890" style="s2">general that I&#39;ve criticized but um have</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.440" end="01:42:33.900" style="s2">you ever seen John Belushi and Joe</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.890" end="01:42:37.470" style="s2">Cocker singing feeling alright on</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.900" end="01:42:40.080" style="s2">Saturday Night Live no it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.470" end="01:42:42.660" style="s2">great moments in television history John</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.080" end="01:42:45.600" style="s2">Belushi becomes Joe Cocker and Joe</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.660" end="01:42:48.240" style="s2">Cocker is so idiosyncratic that to have</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.600" end="01:42:49.980" style="s2">Joe Cocker watching himself acted by</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.240" end="01:42:53.310" style="s2">John Belushi they collaborate on the</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.980" end="01:42:56.160" style="s2">song is disturbing and funny and</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.310" end="01:42:59.070" style="s2">beautiful because Belushi is actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.160" end="01:43:03.300" style="s2">amazing as Joe Cocker as a singer in</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.070" end="01:43:05.310" style="s2">that moment I came to believe that John</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.300" end="01:43:07.560" style="s2">Belushi could run a version of Joe</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.310" end="01:43:10.140" style="s2">Cocker at least to first second and</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.560" end="01:43:12.660" style="s2">third-order in emulation right do you</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.140" end="01:43:14.100" style="s2">point talent right well this is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.660" end="01:43:15.930" style="s2">thing which is I have people that I</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.100" end="01:43:17.730" style="s2">could come back as and I have people</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.930" end="01:43:20.280" style="s2">that I couldn&#39;t come back as to varying</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.730" end="01:43:22.980" style="s2">orders of approximation and so that</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.280" end="01:43:25.320" style="s2">aspect of non fungible identity to me</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.980" end="01:43:27.570" style="s2">dooms the entire rauzein project in a</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.320" end="01:43:36.770" style="s2">way that I can&#39;t explain to people who</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.570" end="01:43:36.770" style="s2">are under its spell um I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.290" end="01:43:42.760" style="s2">so maybe what I&#39;m willing to agree to is</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.140" end="01:43:47.950" style="s2">slightly more limited that is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.760" end="01:43:51.670" style="s2">willing to agree with you that the idea</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.950" end="01:43:54.130" style="s2">that one can subtract away the</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.670" end="01:43:55.420" style="s2">commitments and concerns of identity and</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.130" end="01:44:01.870" style="s2">in effect right what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.420" end="01:44:03.880" style="s2">arguing about is sort of Rawls&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.870" end="01:44:06.130" style="s2">sort of the conceit that we can separate</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.880" end="01:44:07.990" style="s2">away comprehensive doctrines right Oh</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.130" end="01:44:10.210" style="s2">imagine if I didn&#39;t believe in God or</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.990" end="01:44:11.440" style="s2">something and like you know but that</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.210" end="01:44:12.940" style="s2">might be really important to me that I</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.440" end="01:44:18.220" style="s2">believe in God it is important to me</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.940" end="01:44:20.130" style="s2">right so and so I&#39;m like um so I sort of</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.220" end="01:44:23.410" style="s2">agree that the sort of conceit that</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.130" end="01:44:24.970" style="s2">identity is so thin and trivial that you</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.410" end="01:44:27.790" style="s2">can separate it away and then do your</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.970" end="01:44:29.770" style="s2">reasoning that&#39;s a real problem but the</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.790" end="01:44:32.560" style="s2">thing I don&#39;t agree with is that um</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.770" end="01:44:35.110" style="s2">there is some particular barrier of</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.560" end="01:44:37.060" style="s2">identity namely like say the set of</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.110" end="01:44:43.060" style="s2">people who you couldn&#39;t be born as right</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.060" end="01:44:44.620" style="s2">where you couldn&#39;t over time spend</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.060" end="01:44:46.480" style="s2">enough time with those people and talk</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.620" end="01:44:48.130" style="s2">to them to the point where at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.480" end="01:44:50.770" style="s2">that process you&#39;re like I could be born</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.130" end="01:44:52.360" style="s2">as them right it&#39;s it&#39;s like now you</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.770" end="01:44:54.250" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine it</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.360" end="01:44:57.190" style="s2">we have the diachronic again for our</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.250" end="01:44:59.530" style="s2">drinking game yes like you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.190" end="01:45:02.110" style="s2">so the the the the real for me the real</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.530" end="01:45:04.720" style="s2">objection like is that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.110" end="01:45:07.300" style="s2">difference between what I can do merely</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.720" end="01:45:09.910" style="s2">through the OP like through a mental</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.300" end="01:45:12.130" style="s2">operation that we engage in alone right</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.910" end="01:45:14.230" style="s2">and what I can do by learning from</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.130" end="01:45:16.240" style="s2">people and I think I worked with</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.230" end="01:45:19.600" style="s2">somebody who I can&#39;t run very well in</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.240" end="01:45:21.160" style="s2">emulation I do a really basic Peter teal</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.600" end="01:45:23.560" style="s2">impression but I can only go for about</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.160" end="01:45:25.330" style="s2">20 or 30 seconds and then it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.560" end="01:45:27.160" style="s2">very clear that it&#39;s just mannerisms</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.330" end="01:45:29.200" style="s2">because the guys operating system is</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.160" end="01:45:32.530" style="s2">wildly idiosyncratic there&#39;s one guy who</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.200" end="01:45:35.080" style="s2">can do a better job of it named a Jay</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.530" end="01:45:36.940" style="s2">Ryan who probably get to second order</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.080" end="01:45:38.890" style="s2">and I&#39;m kind of just blown away by it</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.940" end="01:45:40.840" style="s2">because Peter&#39;s just too hard to model I</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.890" end="01:45:42.460" style="s2">don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a convergent</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.840" end="01:45:43.660" style="s2">process in general even when you spend a</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.460" end="01:45:46.420" style="s2">lot of time with somebody let me let me</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.660" end="01:45:47.680" style="s2">switch gears yeah you can have the last</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.420" end="01:45:49.710" style="s2">word on that one if you want I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.680" end="01:45:51.270" style="s2">mean to cut you off the</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.710" end="01:45:55.110" style="s2">two topics I want to get to after can I</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.270" end="01:45:57.000" style="s2">say quickly I think that um I I want to</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.110" end="01:45:58.530" style="s2">UM distinguish the question of whether</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.000" end="01:45:59.670" style="s2">you could model them from whether you</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.530" end="01:46:01.080" style="s2">could get yourself into a position where</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.670" end="01:46:03.810" style="s2">you could imagine being born as them I</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.080" end="01:46:07.590" style="s2">guess okay so yeah something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.810" end="01:46:09.660" style="s2">okay good yeah I want to get into one</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.590" end="01:46:11.940" style="s2">issue which is that this doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.660" end="01:46:14.460" style="s2">talk a lot about feeling and I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.940" end="01:46:15.989" style="s2">worry that critical thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.460" end="01:46:17.850" style="s2">something we talk a lot about and</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.989" end="01:46:18.989" style="s2">critical feeling is something we neglect</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.850" end="01:46:22.290" style="s2">okay groupthink</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.989" end="01:46:24.300" style="s2">yes group feel no overthinking yes over</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.290" end="01:46:25.860" style="s2">feeling though these every place that</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.300" end="01:46:27.570" style="s2">you talk about something in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.860" end="01:46:29.130" style="s2">thinking if you substitute the word</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.570" end="01:46:31.920" style="s2">feeling and you realize that feeling is</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.130" end="01:46:33.690" style="s2">a kind of enhanced cognition we somehow</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.920" end="01:46:35.670" style="s2">don&#39;t feel comfortable so I want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.690" end="01:46:38.730" style="s2">about something that happened as we sat</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.670" end="01:46:39.840" style="s2">down in these chairs where I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.730" end="01:46:41.580" style="s2">comfortable talking to you about</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.840" end="01:46:44.130" style="s2">thinking and I&#39;m not very comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.580" end="01:46:45.600" style="s2">talking to you about feeling okay so you</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.130" end="01:46:47.070" style="s2">were saying that you&#39;d reviewed some</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.600" end="01:46:49.230" style="s2">episodes of the show and I said did you</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.070" end="01:46:51.390" style="s2">find them interesting and you quite</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.230" end="01:46:54.630" style="s2">truthfully said you did and then I said</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.390" end="01:46:56.340" style="s2">something like were they worth your</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.630" end="01:46:57.989" style="s2">while because you&#39;d also expressed an</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.340" end="01:46:59.850" style="s2">idea that you prefer to read things</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.989" end="01:47:01.530" style="s2">rather to listen because the you value</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.850" end="01:47:04.230" style="s2">your time and the time is very expensive</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.530" end="01:47:06.020" style="s2">in long-form podcast sorry can I correct</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.230" end="01:47:08.280" style="s2">one thing it&#39;s not only that it&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.020" end="01:47:09.900" style="s2">process information much better when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.280" end="01:47:12.540" style="s2">reading and so in terms of what I can</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.900" end="01:47:14.190" style="s2">remember and think about etc given that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.540" end="01:47:15.540" style="s2">I heard it it&#39;s like less of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.190" end="01:47:17.160" style="s2">true but it&#39;s also the case that</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.540" end="01:47:20.190" style="s2">something is lost without seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.160" end="01:47:21.900" style="s2">inflections the body language hearing</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.190" end="01:47:24.239" style="s2">the warmth or the coldness of the tone</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.900" end="01:47:26.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s an interesting point as to</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.239" end="01:47:28.140" style="s2">whether or not the transcript is the</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.160" end="01:47:29.640" style="s2">interview right what information are</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.140" end="01:47:32.100" style="s2">there so the course what information do</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.640" end="01:47:34.410" style="s2">I prefer to preserve yeah exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.100" end="01:47:36.300" style="s2">yeah but then you sort of said that no</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.410" end="01:47:41.000" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t really a great exercise for</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.300" end="01:47:44.310" style="s2">you or something like that that hurt me</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.000" end="01:47:45.810" style="s2">what are your reactions to that I think</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.310" end="01:47:47.730" style="s2">that the show is quite a bit better and</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.810" end="01:47:50.130" style="s2">particularly one or two of the episodes</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.730" end="01:47:52.170" style="s2">that you listen to I think are</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.130" end="01:47:55.200" style="s2">extraordinary and it made me feel that</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.170" end="01:47:57.690" style="s2">you could not possibly have seen what it</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.200" end="01:48:00.120" style="s2">is that I saw in the in those one or two</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.690" end="01:48:01.650" style="s2">episodes because it would have been</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.120" end="01:48:04.270" style="s2">worth</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.650" end="01:48:07.090" style="s2">ten hours of your time because it was so</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.270" end="01:48:08.560" style="s2">rare now I could be wrong so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.090" end="01:48:10.690" style="s2">interesting that of course I have a</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.560" end="01:48:13.150" style="s2">vested interest and so I&#39;m budgeting</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.690" end="01:48:15.070" style="s2">something for my own distortion I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.150" end="01:48:17.890" style="s2">thinking about what the feedback I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.070" end="01:48:20.380" style="s2">had how specific the feedback made me</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.890" end="01:48:22.720" style="s2">question whether or not I viewed you as</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.380" end="01:48:25.720" style="s2">a reliable receiver of the content of</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.720" end="01:48:27.790" style="s2">the show had I over invested in my image</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.720" end="01:48:30.070" style="s2">of you as the person capable of</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.790" end="01:48:31.540" style="s2">processing what we&#39;re doing here and it</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.070" end="01:48:33.520" style="s2">made me wonder whether or not I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.540" end="01:48:36.910" style="s2">something outside of the Academy which</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.520" end="01:48:39.690" style="s2">the Academy sort of realizes is some</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.910" end="01:48:41.710" style="s2">cheap version of intellectualism and</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.690" end="01:48:43.470" style="s2">storytelling a narrative that would</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.710" end="01:48:45.850" style="s2">never survive in a rigorous academic</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.470" end="01:48:48.810" style="s2">context so I went through a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.850" end="01:48:52.630" style="s2">self-doubt accusation negative feeling</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.810" end="01:48:54.520" style="s2">question and uncertainty about you</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.630" end="01:48:55.900" style="s2">myself and the project that we were</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.520" end="01:48:58.570" style="s2">going to sit down to create an episode</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.900" end="01:49:01.210" style="s2">together this is a great question</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.570" end="01:49:02.200" style="s2">so I guess let me report a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.210" end="01:49:04.360" style="s2">different things so there was the first</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.200" end="01:49:06.850" style="s2">thing when you said you asked me like</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.360" end="01:49:09.370" style="s2">how does that feel to me when you said</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.850" end="01:49:12.730" style="s2">like that hurt me and immediately I felt</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.370" end="01:49:14.380" style="s2">hurt like I felt like reflexive totally</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.730" end="01:49:16.120" style="s2">not conscious empathetic response so I</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.380" end="01:49:18.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t at the time when I first said it</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.120" end="01:49:19.480" style="s2">it didn&#39;t hurt me to say that to you but</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.880" end="01:49:21.130" style="s2">it often</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.480" end="01:49:23.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t why should say both of us are</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.130" end="01:49:25.720" style="s2">quite disagreeable as people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.740" end="01:49:28.120" style="s2">that&#39;s my perception that both of us</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.720" end="01:49:29.860" style="s2">feel comfortable contradicting something</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.120" end="01:49:31.270" style="s2">if we it&#39;s an issue about the courage of</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.860" end="01:49:32.620" style="s2">your convictions I think that you in</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.270" end="01:49:34.720" style="s2">general are very high courage of your</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.620" end="01:49:36.430" style="s2">convictions aren&#39;t willing to share but</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.720" end="01:49:38.290" style="s2">also it&#39;s an issue of I had no</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.430" end="01:49:40.360" style="s2">perception at all that it hurt you when</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.290" end="01:49:41.620" style="s2">I said it and I&#39;m often bad at picking</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.360" end="01:49:43.150" style="s2">up on those signals and it makes it</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.620" end="01:49:45.040" style="s2">easier to because I was masking it</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.150" end="01:49:46.540" style="s2">because it was obviously a vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.040" end="01:49:48.100" style="s2">question so the last thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.540" end="01:49:50.740" style="s2">do was to signal to you that I could be</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.100" end="01:49:52.720" style="s2">easily fair enough but perhaps also I</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.740" end="01:49:53.860" style="s2">could have you know if I were somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.720" end="01:49:55.750" style="s2">otherwise I would predict that or</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.860" end="01:50:00.040" style="s2">something but I didn&#39;t at all cool okay</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.750" end="01:50:03.220" style="s2">so um um I guess so that that was just</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.040" end="01:50:06.130" style="s2">my instinctive response and now like you</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.220" end="01:50:09.190" style="s2">know yeah I think that your your your</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.130" end="01:50:11.350" style="s2">subsequent ruminations maybe the most</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.190" end="01:50:12.700" style="s2">interesting bit in them is that the paid</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.350" end="01:50:15.070" style="s2">about academia right so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.700" end="01:50:17.860" style="s2">interesting to me is that</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.070" end="01:50:21.700" style="s2">the moment at which I have this response</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.860" end="01:50:26.710" style="s2">it it it is a is attributed to me as an</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.700" end="01:50:30.550" style="s2">academic right like it&#39;s so 90s show</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.710" end="01:50:32.710" style="s2">yeah is about the kind of things that</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.550" end="01:50:35.200" style="s2">take place in universities all over the</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.710" end="01:50:38.740" style="s2">country that I&#39;m alleging that has not</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.200" end="01:50:41.350" style="s2">filtered out to some extent to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.740" end="01:50:43.630" style="s2">general public like there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.350" end="01:50:45.670" style="s2">amount of pressure to survive in</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.630" end="01:50:47.860" style="s2">academics causing people in my opinion</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.670" end="01:50:49.690" style="s2">just as we say that constant cut well</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.860" end="01:50:51.640" style="s2">let me say it differently concentration</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.690" end="01:50:53.620" style="s2">camp survivors from World War two death</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.640" end="01:50:56.200" style="s2">camp survivors will often say something</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.620" end="01:50:57.940" style="s2">if they trust you which is don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.200" end="01:50:59.620" style="s2">celebrate us because the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.940" end="01:51:01.180" style="s2">survived weren&#39;t the good ones we did</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.620" end="01:51:02.500" style="s2">what we had to do to survive it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.180" end="01:51:04.570" style="s2">ones who perished that you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.500" end="01:51:06.580" style="s2">thinking about it&#39;s a very tough thing</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.570" end="01:51:09.010" style="s2">to say in general when I meet somebody</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.580" end="01:51:11.080" style="s2">who&#39;s succeeded in academics they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.010" end="01:51:13.090" style="s2">always under a cloud if they did it</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.080" end="01:51:16.270" style="s2">under this era because the pressures are</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.090" end="01:51:17.740" style="s2">simply too severe now it some people do</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.270" end="01:51:18.850" style="s2">better than that you know if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.740" end="01:51:20.410" style="s2">you&#39;re good enough you can have a</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.850" end="01:51:23.410" style="s2">peacocks tail that you in fact are an</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.410" end="01:51:26.020" style="s2">ethical academic but in general people</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.410" end="01:51:28.060" style="s2">are going to have to take intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.020" end="01:51:30.070" style="s2">and moral half-measures in order to</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.060" end="01:51:32.380" style="s2">survive in this competitive of an</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.070" end="01:51:35.440" style="s2">environment so I was trying to talk</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.380" end="01:51:37.180" style="s2">about that in episode 19 not actually</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.440" end="01:51:40.210" style="s2">attempting to single at an individual</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.180" end="01:51:42.490" style="s2">there&#39;s the weirdness that simply</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.210" end="01:51:44.350" style="s2">talking about a problem in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.490" end="01:51:46.570" style="s2">case when people haven&#39;t understood that</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.350" end="01:51:48.580" style="s2">problem will tend to privilege an</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.570" end="01:51:49.990" style="s2">individual but but by the hundredth case</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.580" end="01:51:51.850" style="s2">of it you start to realize though this</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.990" end="01:51:55.510" style="s2">is a general feature pervading the</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.850" end="01:51:58.000" style="s2">society good um so like maybe a couple</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.510" end="01:51:59.980" style="s2">of different responses so I found that</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.000" end="01:52:02.020" style="s2">um the the sort of first of all just the</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.980" end="01:52:04.360" style="s2">scientific console new to me I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.020" end="01:52:10.180" style="s2">know anything about this way in which</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.360" end="01:52:13.960" style="s2">the kind of the propensity of a cell</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.180" end="01:52:16.000" style="s2">towards becoming tumorous like that that</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.960" end="01:52:17.260" style="s2">cuts against its ability like if you</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.000" end="01:52:21.040" style="s2">want to if you want to cut down on that</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.260" end="01:52:22.810" style="s2">you have to make it bad at repair and</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.040" end="01:52:24.070" style="s2">that there&#39;s that that was so</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.810" end="01:52:28.360" style="s2">interesting to me to learn with that</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.070" end="01:52:31.590" style="s2">that is in weirdly the central insight</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.360" end="01:52:34.810" style="s2">than the the narrative and the drama of</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.590" end="01:52:38.380" style="s2">interpersonal warfare within the Academy</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.810" end="01:52:42.310" style="s2">just what is death why is it baked in</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.380" end="01:52:43.270" style="s2">right yeah um so but like so so so as I</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.310" end="01:52:44.590" style="s2">say there are a lot of different things</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.270" end="01:52:45.940" style="s2">and for me that was actually super</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.590" end="01:52:48.460" style="s2">interesting and I went and looked and</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.940" end="01:52:51.880" style="s2">read the abstract of the paper and your</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.460" end="01:52:54.100" style="s2">awesome thing and um and but I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.880" end="01:52:55.840" style="s2">thing is like I I did feel that the sort</p>
<p begin="01:52:54.100" end="01:52:58.690" style="s2">of thrust of the episode was supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.840" end="01:53:00.820" style="s2">be like this is how things can go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.690" end="01:53:03.040" style="s2">and I get that on an interpersonal level</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.820" end="01:53:04.690" style="s2">it is that but the way I hear the story</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.040" end="01:53:06.550" style="s2">yeah there was this incredible</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.690" end="01:53:08.500" style="s2">scientific discovery that happened</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.550" end="01:53:10.210" style="s2">partly because of an academic context</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.500" end="01:53:12.460" style="s2">and it happened and the truth got out</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.210" end="01:53:14.410" style="s2">and like it&#39;s your brother and so you</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.460" end="01:53:16.120" style="s2">love him and you&#39;re heartbroken about</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.410" end="01:53:18.220" style="s2">stuff that happened to him but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.120" end="01:53:21.040" style="s2">my brother and from my point of view</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.220" end="01:53:23.560" style="s2">like look what academia did it got this</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.040" end="01:53:27.700" style="s2">amazing tree yeah kidding Agnes</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.560" end="01:53:30.220" style="s2">let&#39;s actually do this as a emotional</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.700" end="01:53:32.530" style="s2">and cognitive okay who gets to leave</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.220" end="01:53:36.400" style="s2">children people get to become professors</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.530" end="01:53:39.070" style="s2">if you look at the professors who are</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.400" end="01:53:42.520" style="s2">left by a great professor mm-hmm the</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.070" end="01:53:45.040" style="s2">idea that the thought is what got out</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.520" end="01:53:47.740" style="s2">there and and by virtue of the fact you</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.040" end="01:53:50.560" style="s2">know in some sense that there was a</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.740" end="01:53:52.360" style="s2">conflict to do this I called the horse</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.560" end="01:53:54.700" style="s2">and rider problem which is yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.360" end="01:53:57.310" style="s2">let&#39;s knock the rider off of the horse</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.700" end="01:53:59.740" style="s2">and as long as we have the horse then</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.310" end="01:54:01.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what matters this is a complete</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.740" end="01:54:05.650" style="s2">misreading of history because the key</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.600" end="01:54:07.420" style="s2">thing that we find is a Michael attea</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.650" end="01:54:09.430" style="s2">for example great mathematician will</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.420" end="01:54:11.110" style="s2">leave multiple fields medalists as</p>
<p begin="01:54:09.430" end="01:54:13.600" style="s2">students people who are at the very top</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.110" end="01:54:17.140" style="s2">of their game this whole thing is about</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.600" end="01:54:23.470" style="s2">the Train the Train of transmission when</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.140" end="01:54:25.930" style="s2">you actually effectively castrate or</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.470" end="01:54:28.390" style="s2">give a hysterectomy to a professor so</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.930" end="01:54:30.840" style="s2">they cannot reproduce what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.390" end="01:54:33.790" style="s2">is you&#39;re harming the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.840" end="01:54:35.920" style="s2">propagate the specialness that allows</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.790" end="01:54:37.750" style="s2">that that the machine tools of those</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.920" end="01:54:39.920" style="s2">discoveries you&#39;re confusing the</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.750" end="01:54:41.900" style="s2">important measure</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.920" end="01:54:44.660" style="s2">the tool in the machine tool the machine</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.900" end="01:54:46.100" style="s2">tool is the tool that makes tools mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.660" end="01:54:48.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.100" end="01:54:53.000" style="s2">III just I think it&#39;s an incredible</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.770" end="01:54:55.340" style="s2">opportunity and you know you also have</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.000" end="01:54:57.560" style="s2">written on the subject of anger right</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.340" end="01:54:59.990" style="s2">this is a question of functional anger</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.560" end="01:55:02.300" style="s2">mmm-hmm I find that outrageous what you</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.990" end="01:55:04.430" style="s2">just said and I don&#39;t think that I find</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.300" end="01:55:06.470" style="s2">it outrageous because I&#39;m flush with</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.430" end="01:55:08.240" style="s2">chemicals I&#39;m and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:06.470" end="01:55:10.210" style="s2">because it&#39;s my brother if you were to</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.240" end="01:55:12.200" style="s2">talk to me about Douglas pressure</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.210" end="01:55:14.240" style="s2">Douglas pressure was one of the people</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.200" end="01:55:17.270" style="s2">who gave us green fluorescent protein or</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.240" end="01:55:20.030" style="s2">GFP he was driving a shuttle bus in</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.270" end="01:55:21.860" style="s2">Huntsville Alabama before I was</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.030" end="01:55:23.540" style="s2">championing my brother I was championing</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.860" end="01:55:25.130" style="s2">Douglas pressure because how could it be</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.540" end="01:55:28.430" style="s2">that the person who should have been on</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.130" end="01:55:32.060" style="s2">the Nobel Prize for GFP in full view of</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.430" end="01:55:33.590" style="s2">the academic community was driving not</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.060" end="01:55:37.280" style="s2">only a shuttle bus in Huntsville Alabama</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.590" end="01:55:39.410" style="s2">but after being featured in the New York</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.280" end="01:55:42.560" style="s2">Times with a full you know top</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.410" end="01:55:46.280" style="s2">above-the-fold picture of Doug a year</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.560" end="01:55:49.220" style="s2">later he was still driving a shuttle bus</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.280" end="01:55:52.280" style="s2">and feel about it so and I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.220" end="01:55:53.840" style="s2">with all academic rigor what the is</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.280" end="01:55:57.670" style="s2">wrong with that thought process that</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.840" end="01:56:00.110" style="s2">that&#39;s what you think so I think like</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.670" end="01:56:03.260" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re clear in your own</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.110" end="01:56:06.200" style="s2">mind as to exactly which bit of this you</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.260" end="01:56:07.190" style="s2">find offensive it seems to me that from</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.200" end="01:56:11.030" style="s2">the way that you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.190" end="01:56:13.970" style="s2">the Douglas pressure that a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.030" end="01:56:16.490" style="s2">for you is about credit and who gets</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.970" end="01:56:18.380" style="s2">credit it&#39;s about reproduction so your</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.490" end="01:56:19.580" style="s2">your problem is that Douglas pressure</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.380" end="01:56:22.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to have stood as this</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.580" end="01:56:26.260" style="s2">pressure didn&#39;t get to have students</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.360" end="01:56:29.840" style="s2">this is this is just like an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.260" end="01:56:31.760" style="s2">inability to understand what the game is</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.840" end="01:56:35.750" style="s2">if you rather did get to have student</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.760" end="01:56:38.630" style="s2">know he didn&#39;t well I mean no he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.750" end="01:56:40.790" style="s2">he went on to teach didn&#39;t he have</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.630" end="01:56:42.680" style="s2">students taught at an a weird</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.790" end="01:56:44.960" style="s2">undergraduate institution with no</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.680" end="01:56:47.660" style="s2">graduate program you&#39;re really not</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.960" end="01:56:49.460" style="s2">getting it but did he choose to teach</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.660" end="01:56:51.170" style="s2">there and didn&#39;t he see that teaching</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.460" end="01:56:53.090" style="s2">his description of that teaching there</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.170" end="01:56:53.640" style="s2">was that it was extremely valuable to</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.090" end="01:56:56.250" style="s2">him yeah</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.640" end="01:56:58.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a very sweet story and right now</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.250" end="01:57:00.330" style="s2">for example I have a discord group and I</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.800" end="01:57:03.840" style="s2">am teaching people with no formal</p>
<p begin="01:57:00.330" end="01:57:06.060" style="s2">background how to see gauge Theory the</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.840" end="01:57:08.550" style="s2">key point is that you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.060" end="01:57:10.800" style="s2">what a university is it&#39;s a very special</p>

<p begin="01:57:10.800" end="01:57:16.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t is the story of our future I</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.980" end="01:57:18.360" style="s2">mean this is about so we belong to this</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.200" end="01:57:20.640" style="s2">Jewish tradition and I always use the</p>

<p begin="01:57:29.790" end="01:57:35.910" style="s2">about the resources and the ability to</p>

<p begin="01:58:30.360" end="01:58:34.320" style="s2">if you think about the biathlon which is</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.970" end="01:58:36.180" style="s2">what I always give us an example I was</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.320" end="01:58:39.690" style="s2">first time I heard about the biathlon I</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.180" end="01:58:41.640" style="s2">left cross-country skiing and riflery</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.690" end="01:58:45.120" style="s2">what the hell are these two activities</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.640" end="01:58:47.580" style="s2">doing in one sport well if you live in</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.120" end="01:58:49.050" style="s2">Finland you know exactly why you would</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.580" end="01:58:50.340" style="s2">want to combine those two activities</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.050" end="01:58:53.250" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got Russians on your</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.340" end="01:58:55.500" style="s2">eastern border right and so in general</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.250" end="01:58:58.500" style="s2">this is an activity that&#39;s important in</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.500" end="01:59:00.030" style="s2">Norway and Sweden and Finland and</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.500" end="01:59:04.920" style="s2">Russian places like that because you</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.030" end="01:59:06.900" style="s2">shoot the enemy while on skis ok the</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.920" end="01:59:09.270" style="s2">teaching University is an incredible</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.900" end="01:59:12.360" style="s2">confusing object to many people because</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.270" end="01:59:14.820" style="s2">of the Vannevar bush pact called the</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.360" end="01:59:17.360" style="s2">endless frontier we agreed that we were</p>
<p begin="01:59:14.820" end="01:59:20.040" style="s2">going to have the federal government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.360" end="01:59:21.300" style="s2">investment in blue sky research only</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.040" end="01:59:23.520" style="s2">done through the university&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.300" end="01:59:25.980" style="s2">effectively and that meant we took an</p>
<p begin="01:59:23.520" end="01:59:27.800" style="s2">incredibly important facility and we</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.980" end="01:59:30.060" style="s2">confused it with teaching</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.800" end="01:59:31.920" style="s2">now there&#39;s an extent to which those are</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.060" end="01:59:35.040" style="s2">symbiotic that they boost each other the</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.920" end="01:59:36.540" style="s2">teaching and researcher sort of happy</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.040" end="01:59:38.969" style="s2">complements to each other and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.540" end="01:59:39.719" style="s2">way in which they conflict I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.969" end="01:59:44.420" style="s2">understand how you think this</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.719" end="01:59:47.120" style="s2">reproduction so so so there&#39;s suppose um</p>
<p begin="01:59:44.420" end="01:59:49.580" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna reproduce yourself in me</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.120" end="01:59:52.440" style="s2">how do you do that without teaching me</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.580" end="01:59:53.880" style="s2">well the kind of teaching that we</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.440" end="01:59:57.390" style="s2">usually talk about when we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:59:53.880" end="01:59:58.500" style="s2">teaching it tends to be very focused on</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.390" end="01:59:59.969" style="s2">the undergraduate so when you said</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.500" end="02:00:01.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t my brother get to leave students</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.969" end="02:00:03.810" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a relationship of</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.620" end="02:00:05.550" style="s2">graduates and under you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:00:03.810" end="02:00:06.960" style="s2">a relationship to undergraduate students</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.550" end="02:00:11.219" style="s2">because there is no graduate student</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.960" end="02:00:14.040" style="s2">there for me that line is not as as as</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.219" end="02:00:15.870" style="s2">heavy how many members of your</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.040" end="02:00:21.870" style="s2">department on the faculty don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.870" end="02:00:24.030" style="s2">PhDs don&#39;t have PhD HD I believe all of</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.870" end="02:00:25.290" style="s2">them have PhD so that&#39;s new in</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.030" end="02:00:26.370" style="s2">philosophy that is like the older</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.290" end="02:00:29.040" style="s2">generation there were a number the day</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.370" end="02:00:30.840" style="s2">now you have the situation in which you</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.040" end="02:00:32.520" style="s2">have a requirement in order to be able</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.840" end="02:00:35.880" style="s2">to reproduce where you have done</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.520" end="02:00:41.040" style="s2">research this kind of close teaching</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.880" end="02:00:45.600" style="s2">this apprenticeship good and so like I</p>
<p begin="02:00:41.040" end="02:00:47.159" style="s2">think that you can say so this this</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.600" end="02:00:49.050" style="s2">helps clarify a situation so you can say</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.159" end="02:00:50.820" style="s2">your brother was deprived of an</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.050" end="02:00:51.870" style="s2">opportunity to do a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.820" end="02:00:52.469" style="s2">teaching let&#39;s talk about Douglas</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.870" end="02:00:54.150" style="s2">pressure</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.469" end="02:00:55.620" style="s2">Douglas Pasha was fully deprived of</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.150" end="02:00:58.830" style="s2">opportunity to any kind of teaching</p>
<p begin="02:00:55.620" end="02:01:00.630" style="s2">right furthermore he wasn&#39;t able to do</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.830" end="02:01:03.600" style="s2">any more of that kind of research he</p>
<p begin="02:01:00.630" end="02:01:05.670" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get resources he in fact gave</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.600" end="02:01:10.739" style="s2">over his work because his grant mana</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.670" end="02:01:12.360" style="s2">right I&#39;m ready King okay I don&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.739" end="02:01:14.219" style="s2">not as interested in the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.360" end="02:01:15.870" style="s2">good at administrative games who got to</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.219" end="02:01:18.570" style="s2">stay in the game I&#39;m more interested in</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.870" end="02:01:20.489" style="s2">the Douglas pressures and getting the</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.570" end="02:01:22.499" style="s2">Predators the hell out of the way</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.489" end="02:01:24.469" style="s2">so that these guys can continue to work</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.499" end="02:01:26.699" style="s2">in other words they need a starker</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.469" end="02:01:28.739" style="s2">alright the Yiddish for a strong you</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.699" end="02:01:30.719" style="s2">know muscle yeah so you need muscle to</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.739" end="02:01:33.420" style="s2">make sure that the sweet people who</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.719" end="02:01:35.880" style="s2">actually can do great work aren&#39;t preyed</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.420" end="02:01:37.739" style="s2">upon you have sharp Minds and sharp</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.880" end="02:01:39.420" style="s2">elbows and the key point somebody&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.739" end="02:01:42.780" style="s2">to break the sharp bellows right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.420" end="02:01:46.139" style="s2">very important to me I mean I&#39;m but look</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.780" end="02:01:48.570" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a question about and</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.139" end="02:01:50.400" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ve seen many hundreds or</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.570" end="02:01:54.300" style="s2">thousands of these cases I would say</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.400" end="02:01:57.059" style="s2">thousands I would say tens right and</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.300" end="02:01:58.889" style="s2">like into you know in listening to that</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.059" end="02:02:01.980" style="s2">podcast that was listening to it for me</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.889" end="02:02:03.659" style="s2">one case right and then I also have to</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.980" end="02:02:05.159" style="s2">go with my own so you haven&#39;t seen much</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.659" end="02:02:06.869" style="s2">of this I mean you&#39;re at the philosophy</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.159" end="02:02:09.690" style="s2">department I know nothing about how you</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.869" end="02:02:12.300" style="s2">guys do right what I will say is is that</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.690" end="02:02:13.800" style="s2">in situations like let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.300" end="02:02:16.380" style="s2">situation where there&#39;s no skullduggery</p>
<p begin="02:02:13.800" end="02:02:19.110" style="s2">within academics but a career stops so</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.380" end="02:02:21.570" style="s2">every scale wah couldn&#39;t be a more</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.110" end="02:02:23.460" style="s2">important mathematician more or less</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.570" end="02:02:26.340" style="s2">created group theory and Galois theory</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.460" end="02:02:31.050" style="s2">the the day before he died in a duel</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.340" end="02:02:34.050" style="s2">right does it matter that he died yes</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.050" end="02:02:35.969" style="s2">hugely well why we have Galois Theory</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.050" end="02:02:38.010" style="s2">have group Theory thank you very much</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.969" end="02:02:42.360" style="s2">right we could have more we could have</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.010" end="02:02:45.449" style="s2">much more and so the issue of just sort</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.360" end="02:02:47.639" style="s2">of the casual indifference to saying</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.449" end="02:02:50.579" style="s2">that the system works that the story and</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.639" end="02:02:54.659" style="s2">the work could proceed is a stunning</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.579" end="02:02:56.519" style="s2">fact to me like to me you know ray sips</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.659" end="02:03:00.869" style="s2">a loquitur the thing speaks for itself</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.519" end="02:03:02.999" style="s2">and the idea that that is a normal part</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.869" end="02:03:05.179" style="s2">of academics is effectively the proof to</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.999" end="02:03:08.789" style="s2">me that there&#39;s something wildly wrong I</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.179" end="02:03:11.519" style="s2">mean I guess I just think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.789" end="02:03:13.949" style="s2">question like so part of that story was</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.519" end="02:03:15.719" style="s2">a lot of like venality and pressures</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.949" end="02:03:19.949" style="s2">that come from people wanting credit for</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.719" end="02:03:23.639" style="s2">things and people wanting you know</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.949" end="02:03:26.099" style="s2">caring about name and reputation and etc</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.639" end="02:03:27.659" style="s2">and there&#39;s a question there I&#39;m suppose</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.099" end="02:03:29.670" style="s2">we got rid of that suppose we could</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.659" end="02:03:30.979" style="s2">somehow change people&#39;s psyche so that</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.670" end="02:03:33.179" style="s2">they didn&#39;t care about that</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.979" end="02:03:33.960" style="s2">suppose we had the ability to leave</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.179" end="02:03:35.940" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.960" end="02:03:37.500" style="s2">gained resources within the system</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.940" end="02:03:38.310" style="s2">without needing to care about that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.500" end="02:03:39.900" style="s2">proceed from there</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.310" end="02:03:42.870" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s gonna be more or</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.900" end="02:03:44.489" style="s2">less almost the last thing so it comes</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.870" end="02:03:46.830" style="s2">back to status which is where we began</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.489" end="02:03:49.020" style="s2">with so my claim is is that status is</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.830" end="02:03:51.630" style="s2">approximate and the ultimate is the</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.020" end="02:03:53.880" style="s2">ability to transmit and create knowledge</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.630" end="02:03:56.190" style="s2">and the key issue here is is that</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.880" end="02:03:57.960" style="s2">lacking a PhD and lacking the ability to</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.190" end="02:04:00.780" style="s2">compete for grants handily which are</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.960" end="02:04:02.670" style="s2">status mediated means that your line</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.780" end="02:04:06.690" style="s2">becomes self-extinguishing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.670" end="02:04:08.100" style="s2">real issue yeah I do think that this</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.690" end="02:04:14.190" style="s2">actually where it gets back to his</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.100" end="02:04:16.620" style="s2">happiness right um that my life can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.190" end="02:04:18.750" style="s2">about whether my line is extinguished or</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.620" end="02:04:23.090" style="s2">not my life has to be something the</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.750" end="02:04:26.700" style="s2">meaning of which comes home to me and</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.090" end="02:04:28.290" style="s2">like it&#39;s not that that&#39;s not integrated</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.700" end="02:04:30.690" style="s2">into an activity in which I try to put</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.290" end="02:04:34.050" style="s2">something forward but like the the point</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.690" end="02:04:36.750" style="s2">of the pursuit of knowledge can&#39;t be to</p>
<p begin="02:04:34.050" end="02:04:38.730" style="s2">be always handing down the tools to get</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.750" end="02:04:40.440" style="s2">to hand down the tool some more right</p>
<p begin="02:04:38.730" end="02:04:42.150" style="s2">would it keep different place for our</p>
<p begin="02:04:40.440" end="02:04:44.700" style="s2">next disagreement you were taking the</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.150" end="02:04:46.410" style="s2">point of view of Soma I of germ you of</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.700" end="02:04:48.060" style="s2">the self and I have lineage so I think</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.410" end="02:04:50.250" style="s2">we have a great opportunity to begin our</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.060" end="02:04:53.880" style="s2">next conversation I just want to say I</p>
