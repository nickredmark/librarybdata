<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">defriending yourself and then I</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">recommended taking the negative command</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:05.640" style="s2">structure and opening it up and do write</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">a more comprehensive negative and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.640" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">positive promise and some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.780" style="s2">recognize this is my attempt to get the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">the idea of the Aristotelian golden</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.780" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">how we cultivate virtue properly into</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">the promises the idea of the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:21.990" style="s2">integrity is we&#39;re trying to the friend</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get harmony between the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.990" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">patterns and processes were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:29.790" style="s2">inculcate in our sitting and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:31.709" style="s2">patterns and processes by which we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.790" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">govern who regulate and live our lives</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.709" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">we want that consonant we want them for</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">ending each other and affording each</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">other so that what I&#39;m calling in my</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">practice will be transferred to my life</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:44.880" style="s2">and what is occurring in my life can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">brought in to the deep meditative</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.880" end="00:02:52.260" style="s2">reflection of I said and thereby I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">was separately open I can we I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.260" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">remember the being mode in a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">way and so we think of the training</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">precepts by setting up the process of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">resonance and it also is a process by</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:10.260" style="s2">which we are affording opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:11.690" style="s2">apply to apply the practices and skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.260" end="00:03:15.810" style="s2">that were training in this course and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.690" end="00:03:19.610" style="s2">also to celebrate and to remember the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.810" end="00:03:23.670" style="s2">Buddha and the Dharma and the Sangha so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.610" end="00:03:25.470" style="s2">just to review what we do is of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.670" end="00:03:28.079" style="s2">we try to live out the promises</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.470" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">throughout the day but at the end of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.079" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">sit right normally say now you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">slowly throughout your practice trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:37.200" style="s2">as best you can to integrate what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">cultivated in your practice with the</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:49.890" style="s2">to yourself with intentionality you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.150" end="00:03:53.100" style="s2">trying to make a promise the way you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.890" end="00:03:55.560" style="s2">would make a sincere promise with</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.100" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">integrity let sincere promise to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.560" end="00:04:00.060" style="s2">friend so you&#39;re making that promise as</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.440" end="00:04:02.609" style="s2">a way of trying to integrate what you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:24.539" style="s2">precepts all of these processes do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.860" end="00:04:29.410" style="s2">find that helpful</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.590" end="00:27:08.070" style="s2">and I&#39;ve done a little bit of practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.820" end="00:27:10.580" style="s2">of Tantra to try and also understand as</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.070" end="00:27:13.769" style="s2">I mentioned last time the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.580" end="00:27:17.100" style="s2">interpenetration of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.769" end="00:27:19.230" style="s2">practices and sexuality so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.100" end="00:27:22.019" style="s2">answers from like a Western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.230" end="00:27:25.049" style="s2">but in my mind I&#39;m putting it into Vella</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.049" end="00:27:29.610" style="s2">practice have done of Tantra right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.409" end="00:27:31.950" style="s2">one of course is a second dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.610" end="00:27:34.679" style="s2">approach and this is the idea that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.950" end="00:27:37.110" style="s2">have sort of this don&#39;t know what to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.679" end="00:27:39.000" style="s2">call it actually in the metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.110" end="00:27:40.769" style="s2">the secretary dynamic approach but you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.000" end="00:27:44.100" style="s2">know the Freudian Union idea of libido</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.769" end="00:27:47.460" style="s2">we have sort of this basic energy of</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.100" end="00:27:49.889" style="s2">attraction and motivation it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.460" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">the continuity between our physiological</p>

<p begin="00:27:55.350" end="00:28:05.190" style="s2">our mind and our heart and then the idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.009" end="00:28:10.230" style="s2">is when we sexually abstain that libido</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.190" end="00:28:12.450" style="s2">gets reach annulled sublimated to use</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.230" end="00:28:15.690" style="s2">the pro extra it gets reach annulled and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.450" end="00:28:21.049" style="s2">if that energy pours into something else</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.690" end="00:28:23.640" style="s2">perhaps a particular practice now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.049" end="00:28:26.540" style="s2">interesting and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.640" end="00:28:28.440" style="s2">and I I think it ties in it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.540" end="00:28:30.810" style="s2">psychodynamic stuff has got some very</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.440" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">powerful connections to the actual</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.740" end="00:28:41.550" style="s2">and theoretical power going for it comes</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.110" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">from the work of Michael Anderson and</p>

<p begin="00:30:31.650" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">out to really feel rooted or to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.030" end="00:30:40.310" style="s2">visualize a route growing into the earth</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:42.740" style="s2">yes so that is a difficulty there is why</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.310" end="00:30:44.870" style="s2">variation within the population our</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.740" end="00:30:48.170" style="s2">degree to which people can get absorbed</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.870" end="00:30:50.750" style="s2">into visualization and so I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.170" end="00:30:54.530" style="s2">responsive to your challenge Chris so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.750" end="00:30:55.580" style="s2">maybe to you know try doing a much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.530" end="00:30:59.180" style="s2">later</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.580" end="00:31:00.470" style="s2">looting not as deep and not just and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.180" end="00:31:02.180" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get a lot of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.470" end="00:31:04.550" style="s2">out of it remember we&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.180" end="00:31:07.610" style="s2">trying to recapture sort of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.550" end="00:31:10.070" style="s2">strong intense experience just you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.610" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">do the core routing in the core of the</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:20.570" style="s2">go flow just come into even a very basic</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.330" end="00:31:23.060" style="s2">awareness and just you know just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.570" end="00:31:25.180" style="s2">just activating an integration of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.060" end="00:31:27.380" style="s2">introspection looking into your mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.180" end="00:31:28.940" style="s2">looking into your body with intercepts I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.380" end="00:31:33.410" style="s2">just feel you&#39;re out there and feel your</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.940" end="00:31:35.690" style="s2">chest just kill it and then go in to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.410" end="00:31:37.880" style="s2">practice and again don&#39;t worry so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.690" end="00:31:39.410" style="s2">about the deep visualization perhaps if</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.880" end="00:31:40.670" style="s2">you need to while you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.410" end="00:31:42.380" style="s2">routing practice actually just reach</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.670" end="00:31:44.420" style="s2">touch the earth and just feel that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.380" end="00:31:48.890" style="s2">groundedness maybe for even say to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.420" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">yourself I&#39;m grounded I&#39;m stable all</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.890" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">right and so perhaps that will help</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:55.340" style="s2">sometimes when will people who have who</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:58.730" style="s2">don&#39;t have a strong visualization more</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.340" end="00:32:01.640" style="s2">external actions and a more compressed</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.730" end="00:32:03.410" style="s2">form of doing this I can be helpful try</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.640" end="00:32:05.330" style="s2">that and see if that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.410" end="00:32:09.290" style="s2">if not please come back and ask a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.330" end="00:32:12.170" style="s2">question again Andrey Ferreira</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.290" end="00:32:14.300" style="s2">hello again Andrey I know that you said</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.170" end="00:32:16.100" style="s2">that there are some bad ways of using</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.300" end="00:32:18.430" style="s2">meditation I would just like to ask if</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.100" end="00:32:23.060" style="s2">it&#39;s okay to use a quicksave in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.430" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">solve an order to stall or meditate on</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.060" end="00:32:30.170" style="s2">urges connected with addiction yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:32.690" style="s2">that is not an abusive way so in any</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.170" end="00:32:33.980" style="s2">ways in which we&#39;re addicted in any ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.690" end="00:32:36.380" style="s2">in which we&#39;re following in to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.980" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">reciprocal narrowing that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.380" end="00:32:41.720" style="s2">uses of meditation of mindfulness is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:44.120" style="s2">exactly to allow us to confront and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.720" end="00:32:45.590" style="s2">challenge and respond to reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.120" end="00:32:48.679" style="s2">narrowing that we get in an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.590" end="00:32:50.509" style="s2">and try and afford reciprocal opening so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.679" end="00:32:53.019" style="s2">is a completely appropriate thing to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.509" end="00:32:55.369" style="s2">doing very very much so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.019" end="00:32:57.139" style="s2">max Breanna</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.369" end="00:32:59.059" style="s2">are there any practices we can apply the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.139" end="00:33:00.980" style="s2">five precepts further through meditation</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.059" end="00:33:04.519" style="s2">sometimes I consciously reflect on some</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.980" end="00:33:10.970" style="s2">areas I like it so that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.519" end="00:33:13.789" style="s2">interesting so if you find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.970" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">an area you&#39;re lacking in one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.789" end="00:33:19.340" style="s2">can sometimes work is let&#39;s say it&#39;s I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.019" style="s2">not I don&#39;t know you max I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.340" end="00:33:23.659" style="s2">accusing you of anything let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.019" end="00:33:25.999" style="s2">find that you&#39;re lying try to remember</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.659" end="00:33:27.889" style="s2">the situation which you lied to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.999" end="00:33:30.860" style="s2">pick it up in your mind and they do</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.889" end="00:33:33.889" style="s2">Metta towards it do matter towards that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.860" end="00:33:35.419" style="s2">situation and try on Paul what was what</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.889" end="00:33:37.639" style="s2">like what was happening in you what</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.419" end="00:33:39.499" style="s2">identity are you assuming what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.639" end="00:33:40.970" style="s2">on and even apply the five factors of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.499" end="00:33:42.710" style="s2">acquiring mindfulness within there</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.970" end="00:33:45.289" style="s2">within that site of matter what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.710" end="00:33:46.999" style="s2">on in the what identity I&#39;m projecting</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.289" end="00:33:48.649" style="s2">and the five factors been climbing</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.999" end="00:33:50.869" style="s2">mindfulness with the matter on to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.649" end="00:33:55.879" style="s2">person and really trying unpack what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.869" end="00:33:57.710" style="s2">happening that situation for you social</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.879" end="00:33:59.179" style="s2">green I was taught to minute with my</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.710" end="00:34:01.659" style="s2">eyes open can you comment on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.179" end="00:34:08.200" style="s2">benefits downside of eyes open or closed</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.659" end="00:34:12.740" style="s2">so one of the benefits of eyes open is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.200" end="00:34:14.929" style="s2">that people are less likely to trigger a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.740" end="00:34:17.750" style="s2">lot of mental time travel zipping off</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.929" end="00:34:20.319" style="s2">into the past it still happens but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.750" end="00:34:24.049" style="s2">reduced a bit one of the difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.319" end="00:34:27.799" style="s2">with eyes open is it&#39;s much harder for</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.049" end="00:34:30.109" style="s2">people to get the interoceptive stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.799" end="00:34:32.210" style="s2">get all the embodied awareness the sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.109" end="00:34:36.619" style="s2">of flow so there&#39;s a bit of a trade-off</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.210" end="00:34:38.059" style="s2">there I think that for novices overall</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.619" end="00:34:39.950" style="s2">in my experience so this I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.059" end="00:34:41.750" style="s2">scientific evidence is just anecdotal I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.950" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">may be teaching this for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.750" end="00:34:47.419" style="s2">generally novices find eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:50.710" style="s2">better than I slightly open</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.419" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">I hope that that answers your question</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.710" end="00:34:56.210" style="s2">there is there is you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">sense of strength and balances but it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.210" end="00:35:01.309" style="s2">seems like for novices eyes closed is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:01.740" style="s2">better initial practice not mandatory of</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.309" end="00:35:03.510" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.740" end="00:35:06.660" style="s2">I just recommend it for the reasons I</p>
