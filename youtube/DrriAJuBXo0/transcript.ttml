<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:27.040" style="s2">fair amount of our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">on the book peer-to-peer the commons</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.040" end="00:01:33.200" style="s2">manifesto written by michelle</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">and two co-authors uh vasilis castakis</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:38.560" style="s2">for me michelle you can say your name is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">better than i</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.560" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">think names are not always that easy but</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">alex pasaritis but i could be wrong</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">find this conversation interesting go</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">back in here</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">basically about the first half of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">book before we jump in though i am going</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">to ask michelle to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">review two main topics which are</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">critical to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to be talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">those two topics</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">are what is peer-to-peer in its simplest</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">and then another concept which goes</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">through all of michelle&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">is the idea of the commons so i would</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">ask michelle to give us a little review</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:22.160" style="s2">about what he means when he says</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">the comments so let&#39;s start with what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.160" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">right well i think a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:29.520" style="s2">your audience will know that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">it was used in the technology field</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.520" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">about 15-20 years ago when</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">you know we we had this new</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">configuration where any computer</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">could talk to any computer without going</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:43.599" style="s2">through a server or</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">any centralized entity and so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.599" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">saying is this is also social</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.200" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.599" style="s2">so we have now technologies which allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">peers</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.599" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">to permissionlessly connect with each</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:57.360" style="s2">you know communicate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">organize things with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.360" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">and also uh you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">produce value together and distribute</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">value together so it&#39;s much more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">just communication technology it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">you know create alternative value</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:14.239" style="s2">circuits that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">may or may not be market oriented and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.239" end="00:03:17.760" style="s2">to understand the historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">significance you know imagine a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.760" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">village</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">uh ten thousand years ago you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:23.360" style="s2">everybody everybody is your uncle or</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">your nephew or</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.360" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">your niece and so if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:31.120" style="s2">you basically talk it out you know as</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">long as it&#39;s inside</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.120" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">the village you you can you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">peacefully arrange</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">uh any conflict uh but then as we got</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">bigger as humanity we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">you know we we created big organization</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s just impractical and too</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:48.159" style="s2">expensive to do</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">everything you know anybody everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.159" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">talking to everybody so we basically</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">invented a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">you know once you have centralized</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">hierarchy then it&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:03:59.519" style="s2">to do peer-to-peer because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">competing you know with with</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.519" end="00:04:02.879" style="s2">armies and other countries and and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">so that was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.879" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">uh something that i think was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">determining</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">in our human history but i think today</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">able technologically and socially to</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">vast projects like you know linux the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">free software</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">operating system or you know arduino</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">open design electronics</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">uh and we combine thousands and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">thousands of people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">necessarily working</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">in a hierarchical relationship to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">other so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">you know to be a bit provocative i call</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">this a peak hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">and so the idea that distributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.280" style="s2">networks can be as strong</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:42.160" style="s2">as centralized entities you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.280" end="00:04:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.160" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">uh dynamic but i think this is very</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">interesting and then of course how both</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">try to adapt to each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">and and create hybrid uh configurations</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">uh the second point the comments is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">of shared resources so basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">you know you can allocate resources</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.080" style="s2">through the gift</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">which is uh you know in complex tribal</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.080" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">civilizations you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:12.479" style="s2">you know one family one clan one village</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">gives something</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.479" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">and that creates uh a duty of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">reciprocity and that&#39;s how you basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">create social relationships and keep the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.840" style="s2">peace</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.759" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">then we got into you know wars of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.840" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">conquest and it becomes redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">so basically the empire you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">overrun</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">and you get lots of advantages but of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">course you have to have disobedience</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">and paid tribute and the third one</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">is the market and the fourth one is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">commons this is a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">so anybody can contribute to a shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">resource like the linux free software</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.320" end="00:05:51.199" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">and everybody can use it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.199" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">this can be done also in the physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:57.120" style="s2">space uh you know there&#39;s a tenfold</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:06:00.400" style="s2">increase in urban commons</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.120" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">in cities so 10 times more in just 10</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.400" end="00:06:04.160" style="s2">years time</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">but you can do you know all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.160" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">using that dynamic and so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">put it next to the state which is about</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">and next to the market which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">about equal value exchange</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">this is about building things</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">collectively which have an advantage for</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">all the participants</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">who are contributing so this is the time</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">of the re-emergence of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">as we are overusing</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">resources on the planet historically</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">what has happened after</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:37.120" style="s2">such extractive periods is that humanity</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:39.039" style="s2">uses the commons as a kind of healing</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.039" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">because pooling and mutualizing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">is absolutely the best way to bring down</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">the human footprint there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">nothing else even beats it uh closely</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">uh so that&#39;s why the comments today are</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">such important then you put the two</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">you know peer-to-peer dynamics creating</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">comments together that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">the era we&#39;re in in in my view</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">well very good that was a good crisp</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">discussion of those two key concepts</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">we&#39;ll come back to lots of times so</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">let&#39;s jump into</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.280" style="s2">chapter three of the book and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">peer-to-peer and the new</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.280" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">socio-technological</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">frameworks you say in theory</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">the internet should provide a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">for many-to-many communications</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">using all other forms of media and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">capacity for self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">that is a result of permissionless</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">communication and the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:35.440" style="s2">to create distribute value in new ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">i.e self-organization could be put to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.440" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">use in the sphere of production</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">tell us what you mean by that what are</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">the benefits because those are seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">all positive attributes and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.520" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a little bit about maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">of the negatives that seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.520" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">emerged from this ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">right absolutely so you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">nothing in the world that is a pure good</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">you know two sides of the coin so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">very happy to discuss the negative side</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:05.120" style="s2">but you know just as like 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">people were exaggerating the positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.120" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:09.599" style="s2">people are now exaggerating the negative</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">size and they&#39;re forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.599" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">all the benefits that we got with it</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of finding the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">balance in within those two polarities</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">so um i don&#39;t know if you remember this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:25.759" style="s2">maybe 10 15 years ago uh pekka himanan</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">wrote a book the hacker</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.759" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">and it was kind of updating that book by</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">max weber called the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">you know which described the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">of capitalist values capitalist ethics</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">after the reformation and you know he</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">makes the link between</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">how the religious reformation at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">uh meant that you know markets became</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.560" style="s2">something positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">right so pekka himmenon describes this</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.560" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">emerging field of free software and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">notices a complete change</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">in mentality and so basically the two</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">values are</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">passion and freedom so we now have</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">social technical systems which allow</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">to join them by choice so they are open</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:15.279" style="s2">collaborative systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">and so that freedom creates passion</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.279" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">so the fact that you can actually choose</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">your activity the ones that you love the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">most that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">that you find the most meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">creates at the same time this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">very huge motivational extra</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">and you know think about to to make it a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">very simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">example you have encyclopedia britannica</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">which you know i used to use an</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">absolutely excellent resource but then</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">you have the wikipedia where</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">you know 100 percent of the people there</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">are there because they want to be there</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">um and so no matter how much money you</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">have how big you are how expert you are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard for uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">that kind of entity to compete with this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">kind of open network</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">and so what will happen is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">one or more individuals say we want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">do this like</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">we need an alternative operating system</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.880" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">uh you know to uh not having not having</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">to use microsoft for example or</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">we want direct access to organic food in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">our neighborhood without you know going</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">big store and paying 30 percent more</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">whatever the goal is we you we now</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">basically have the freedom to broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">these projects and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">people would adhere to it and they will</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:33.839" style="s2">do so with a substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.839" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">and so most of the time these these</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">projects start with passion</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">but of course you can&#39;t eat passion so</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:46.240" style="s2">the second step is usually how can we</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">make a living</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.240" end="00:10:49.440" style="s2">and continue doing this because we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">really like and love to do this</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.440" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">right so around these</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">open productive communities you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">an entrepreneurial coalition and i call</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">it sometimes the enter</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">donario coalition because of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">ideally</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">around the commons you want a vibrant</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">market system that actually benefits the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">commoners and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">takes good care of the you know the web</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">of life the natural resources that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">used in that project</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">so you around this productive</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">community you try to create a generative</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">economy an ethical economy</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">and so that&#39;s step two step three is you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">have to manage the infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">and so what you do there is you create</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">neutral</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">associations for benefit associations</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">which enable and empower</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:42.160" style="s2">the collaboration to occur so typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">for example the wikimedia foundation</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.160" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">will not order you know people to write</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">the articles but they will</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:50.639" style="s2">have editors that have the power to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.639" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s very important because that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">defends the integrity of the system</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.440" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a command hierarchy but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">still have a control hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">and you know the free software and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">associated</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">technologies you know you know is one</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">sixth of gdp already since 2011</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">so this is a substantial part already of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:15.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">u.s economy and and the global economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.760" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">now i want to explain one important</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">once you have a system where some people</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">get paid and others don&#39;t get paid</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">you have a question do i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">things for free</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">and see only a few people benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">our common work</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">and so that creates a whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">where these communities are going to try</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">to do things differently to have more</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:44.440" style="s2">equity</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">and this is sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.440" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">pre-distribution</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:50.639" style="s2">so imagine you create a membrane around</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">your productive community</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.639" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">you you know you get market income maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">you get subsidies or whatever you get</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">but internally you can redistribute the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:03.279" style="s2">in a different way and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">contributory accounting and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.279" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">hundreds of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">you know hundreds of examples that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">have in my p2p accounting section</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">uh of my wiki so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">will try to create new types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">relationships with the entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">for example we are big fans of something</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">called reciprocity licensing</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">and the basic idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">knowledge is free knowledge can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.000" style="s2">shared but</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">if you want to use it commercially you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.000" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">know you have to become a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">association</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">or you know some kind of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:43.519" style="s2">uh which uh you know it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">promise of reciprocity basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.519" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">this is less important in free software</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">because you know everybody can use it</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">it&#39;s it requires fairly</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">relatively low capital but if you want</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">you know some project with machines and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">buildings and actually produce something</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.279" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">you you may want some protection from</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">purely predatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">uh you know companies so just take the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">open source</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">but don&#39;t reciprocate so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:16.399" style="s2">you know first we had a free software</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">and open design communities then we had</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.399" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">the urban commons coming on in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:23.839" style="s2">with a tenfold increase uh and now we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">see the first premises</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.839" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">of distributed manufacturing and we call</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">it cosmo local because</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">everything that slides is global and</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">and everything that&#39;s heavy is local</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">and pos and potentially cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">so just to give you one example of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">this is called the multi-factory system</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a coalition of 120</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">crafts factories in europe</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">so these are usually people who do</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">materials so you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">converting plastic or working with wood</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">or iron</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">or steel or 3d printing and they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">you know look for cheap</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">abandoned factories in the you know in</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.480" style="s2">the ports of the cities and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">but they do this cooperatively they use</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.480" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">open source methods and they have what</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">they call the invisible factory</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">which is the place where they work</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">together you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">independent of the the place where they</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">are working so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">they have their own commons if you like</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">where they&#39;re building this collective</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.880" style="s2">experience and knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">for their whole network so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.880" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">typical example of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">cosmo local production and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">you know this is very very important</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">because we spend three times more</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:46.000" style="s2">transporting stuff than making stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:50.000" style="s2">so if you can produce at the place of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.000" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">on demand using distributed</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">manufacturing this should have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">substantial effect</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">on the human footprint and if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.880" style="s2">pull your resources you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.079" style="s2">mutualize</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.880" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">parts of your provisioning systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.079" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">then you get enormous benefits because</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">you know we we calculated it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">uh in a report called the thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">of peer production and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">we looked at the agriculture and it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">about 80</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">so you know produce as much food but</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">with 80 less uh matter and energy usage</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s very important it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">my own personal passions</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">is the local agriculture movement but</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">unfortunately as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">out the economics are still hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">to work right</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">so long as we don&#39;t have a strong carbon</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:45.839" style="s2">tax</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">because you know all that moving of food</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.839" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">from california to the east coast or</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">even worse a salmon caught in alaska</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">sent to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">china to be processed and then sent back</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.360" style="s2">to the united states</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">gets a free ride by not paying the full</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.360" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">of the transportation and my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:06.319" style="s2">calculations say</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">if you put an honest carbon tax say 100</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.319" end="00:17:10.319" style="s2">us dollars or 100 euros per ton of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">carbon equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.319" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">suddenly local agriculture can out</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">compete the industrial agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">machine but until then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">hard especially</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">in you know places that are optimized</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">like the united states</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">very very efficient industrial</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">agricultural systems hard to out compete</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">it on price</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">absolutely and maybe i can say something</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">about this because this is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">important so</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">you know we have a value regime we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">decided in the 18th century</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:40.559" style="s2">that wealth is created through</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">extraction so you know you need scarce</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.559" end="00:17:43.919" style="s2">commodities in order to be able to price</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.919" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you realize the surplus</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">and so typically anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">regenerative or regenerative and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">anything that creates abundance becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">cheap or free right so that you you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:01.679" style="s2">a fundamental contradiction in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">system where</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.679" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">an organic farmer who improves his soil</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:11.280" style="s2">every year will get punished</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">because the farmer who destroys the soil</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">every year</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">will get much more subsidized and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">uh and so that&#39;s fundamental so as we if</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t change to a contributory</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">value regime the things that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">you know are not going to work very well</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">you know unless</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going me to willing to be to to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">extremes and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:36.960" style="s2">i was recently looking at the bruderhof</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">communities which</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.960" end="00:18:40.080" style="s2">i&#39;m quite impressed with i you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">not the kind of life that i would</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.080" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">lead because you you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">promise obedience and and pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.200" style="s2">um you know forget about your personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">development it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.200" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">uh uh system but i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">ever seen them i mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">you know they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.919" style="s2">very productive they&#39;re and they have</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">everything they need</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.919" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">and so what they&#39;ve done what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:07.520" style="s2">done is you know some kind of radical</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.679" style="s2">mutualization like the monasteries did</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.520" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">in the middle ages and you know they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">grown to 3 000 people it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you can confirm this but</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">i learned that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">amish you know also very collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">in their community</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:25.360" style="s2">actually have the most productive</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:26.880" style="s2">agriculture in the u.s i</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.360" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">find it hard to believe but i&#39;ve read it</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.880" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">in two or three articles</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">and so it&#39;s probably worth looking at</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">whether that&#39;s true or not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:36.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting the bruderhofs i</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">actually drive right</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.880" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">by one of their industrial facilities on</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">the way to visit my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:44.080" style="s2">someday i&#39;m going to have to stop in and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.320" style="s2">visit up in pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.080" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">in the united states with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.320" end="00:19:49.600" style="s2">mennonites and amish</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be learned there but i</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.600" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">would also caution you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">that they are exceedingly industrial</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">in their agricultural processes heavy</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">users of pesticides and fertilizer</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">oh really yeah they&#39;ll use up land and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">then move on</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">and so yes they are amazingly productive</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.679" style="s2">and their farms are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">very prosperous but i would say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.679" end="00:20:12.480" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:14.480" style="s2">are not at all on board at least most of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.480" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">them with regenerative agricultural and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.480" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">permacultural techniques</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a lot to learn there but</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">i would say that they&#39;re by no means the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">perfect model they&#39;re one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">one of the models that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">studying lately the mennonites</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">and also the israeli kibbutz now the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">israeli kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">is another extremely interesting model</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">which i would suggest might actually be</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">more appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:38.000" style="s2">in many ways than the mennonites though</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">i do advocate</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.000" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">the mennonite style of local collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">decision-making about technology</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.840" end="00:20:47.679" style="s2">right in the mennonite world the</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:48.320" style="s2">communities are organized into something</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.679" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.320" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">parishes in regular protestant or</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">catholic religion but they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">small 25 to 50 families</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">and the technological decisions about</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">whether we should adopt a technology or</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">not are made at that level</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">and often after years of debate and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:05.840" style="s2">they&#39;ll come to different conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">people think oh yeah the amish they all</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.840" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">do this they all do that no they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">they vary at this</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">local level for instance some will allow</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:14.400" style="s2">electricity in the barn for the milking</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:16.799" style="s2">machines for the cow</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.400" end="00:21:18.240" style="s2">and refrigeration but no electricity in</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.799" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">the house then some will say no</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.240" end="00:21:21.520" style="s2">electricity at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">and so i think there&#39;s a lot to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.520" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">learned there but i would caution that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">agricultural practices tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">more industrial than you would think</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">because they&#39;re tightly coupled to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">monetary system</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">but the other thing that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">learning from them is they have an</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">alternative form of finance</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">they essentially have collective banking</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">where if you&#39;re a mennonite or amish and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:43.520" style="s2">you want to start a business and many of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">them get into</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.520" end="00:21:46.640" style="s2">businesses like furniture building or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">construction or</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.640" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">small factories they don&#39;t go to banks</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">they will go to their community and they</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:55.200" style="s2">have a form of collective capital with</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">return built into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.200" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">so they can avoid the exploits from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">commercial banking sector</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">and whatever interest or implied</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">interest comes back</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">is kept within the communities i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to learn there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">another distinction i&#39;d like to make you</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">call it the light and the heavy i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">in our game b world one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.640" style="s2">distinctions we make which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">very similar and maps almost on to light</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.640" end="00:22:20.760" style="s2">and heavy but not quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:22.400" style="s2">is the distinction between rivalries and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.760" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">non-rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.400" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">non-rivalrous means things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:28.960" style="s2">replicated very inexpensively</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">and that can be digital like you know an</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.960" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">mp3 file</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">obviously costs very little to replicate</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.039" style="s2">but it also can include drugs you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">many many drugs now can be manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.039" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">one penny one cent per pill and yet they</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">may still</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:46.000" style="s2">charge you know 20 a pill and so things</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">that can be duplicated</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.000" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">at a very small fraction of their</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">really ought to be made in as large a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">possible</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">well rival risk goods like a ham</p>

<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a very different dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">there and there&#39;s always going to be</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">also suggest laying that framework on</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">top of thinking through</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">alternative systems and we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">encourage the widest possible use of</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">and put our attention to reforming how</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.840" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">we think about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:33.039" style="s2">cooperative signaling related to the</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">20 years ago with the kind of conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:46.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">our society treats immaterial goods as</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.000" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">if they were scarce</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">so we basically do everything we can to</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">cooperation difficult to intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">property and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">uh rules so you know we we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">artificial scarcity in the immaterial</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">world in a world of light you know what</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">what we said and we treat</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:11.200" style="s2">material things as if they were infinite</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">so we we don&#39;t take into account</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.200" end="00:24:15.360" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s only so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">copper and so much oil and so much</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.360" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">of a resource in the ground uh and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">we should be doing right we should take</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">into account</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">that we do live in a relatively finite</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">and that we uh should make it difficult</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">to solve problems together because</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.279" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">that the the system that we have is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">creating all these kinds of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">crises</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:44.000" style="s2">but then it creates really heavy</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">barriers about how to solve them</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.000" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">and you know i used to work for bp a</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">long time ago in the early 90s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">which is at the time that they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">buying up all these solar</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">companies and uh electric cars</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">and basically destroyed them you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">that was like physically destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">electric cars</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">back in the day because they they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">want this to compete</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">uh you know with what they had</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s only possible because of co</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">because of copyright and intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">property</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">you know if you had open designs then</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">other people could have made</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">these uh electric cars so we lost in my</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">view we lost 30 years because of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">yep and it&#39;s a fundamental problem and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">whatever comes out on the other side of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">the crisis we&#39;re headed to i certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">hope that people will remember that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">make that which is easily reproducible</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">without being burdensome upon the earth</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">reproducible and as you implied you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">to my mind the number one mission</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.080" end="00:25:43.760" style="s2">of the human race in the 21st century is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">to learn to live within</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.760" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">the boundaries of what the earth can</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">continuously produce</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.279" style="s2">and not just for our own good but also</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">for the other species that we share the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.279" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">earth with</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">and so those two things together strike</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">me as you know the first two pillars</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">of creating this new world now we talked</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:01.840" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">the cool things that can be done on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.840" end="00:26:04.559" style="s2">internet and sure enough there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">of you know i was</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.559" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">involved with building the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">the pre-internet i actually started</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">at the very first consumer online</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.360" end="00:26:16.480" style="s2">service back in 1980</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">a company called the source in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">designed one of the earliest email</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">systems and i designed one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">earliest forum systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">and was also a product manager for one</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">of the first precursors to what we might</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">wasn&#39;t exactly the same but it was close</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.799" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">enough so anyway i&#39;ve been watching this</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:33.679" style="s2">stuff and participating in it since the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">very beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.679" end="00:26:38.640" style="s2">and i will say we all thought we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">doing the lord&#39;s work right we thought</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.640" end="00:26:41.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">we would be building tools that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.120" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">make democracy better that would make</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">talked about and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">those things are happening and it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">you point out it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:54.480" style="s2">to focus on the positives too but</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:26:58.080" style="s2">maybe i&#39;ve been a little late today i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:26:59.679" style="s2">come to realize that there are some</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.080" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">serious negatives we have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.679" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">about this emerging</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.799" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">internet world in fact i did quite a</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">there is no conspiracy for this to</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the emergent result of capitalistic</p>

<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">you know so we had this</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:05.600" style="s2">idea of the filter bubble some years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.799" style="s2">which you know these algorithms kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">tend to present to you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.799" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">what confirms your interests and your</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">is that i actually don&#39;t want any other</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">i&#39;ve lost a lot of joy you know doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">this kind of work in the last</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">two years because of this yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">very real thing in fact the film the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:46.720" style="s2">social dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.080" style="s2">focuses on that you know we think</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.720" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.080" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">that everybody and his historically this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">was sort of true had more or less</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">similar sources of information and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">assume that at least people had some</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">agreement about the facts if not about</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">what should be done about them</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">but because of these filter bubbles and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.320" style="s2">these algorithms which</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.159" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">select things that outrage us which</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.320" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">press the dopamine buttons in our brains</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s now the fact that people have very</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">different flows of information they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:17.760" style="s2">not similar</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">at all right no no but you know even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.760" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">you do a search</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">in uh in google uh on i&#39;ll do it on my</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">computer you&#39;ll do it on yours</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">we we even that we won&#39;t find the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">things anymore</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">yeah they think of a very good example</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">on climate change if you type in climate</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.559" style="s2">the auto continuations i.e the suggested</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:38.640" style="s2">searches you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.559" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">are radically different depending on</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.640" end="00:31:42.559" style="s2">where you live</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">so if you&#39;re in texas it&#39;ll say you type</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:45.000" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:46.559" style="s2">climate change and some of the suggested</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.000" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">continuations</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">is a hoax you know is nothing etc if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">do it in new york city it will say</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">is a existential risk to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting nobody at google</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">made those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">these were machine learning based</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">extractions from patterns of what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">which as you say creates a filter bubble</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.039" style="s2">does not present</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">objective view of reality but rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.039" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">reinforces a set of prejudices</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">so that new york and texas now have</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">radically different views about climate</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">change even though there&#39;s only one set</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">of objective facts</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">which neither side sees in a pure form</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.440" style="s2">right so maybe one thing we we can do</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:27.039" style="s2">and this is you know what i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.440" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">do with the p2p foundation</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.039" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">so this is called object-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">relationality</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:34.399" style="s2">you know it&#39;s one of the branches of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">maybe sociology i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">but the basic idea is that you know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">is the commons about</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a shared object that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">and so in this case what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.960" style="s2">that you&#39;re congregating but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">congregating to build something</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.960" end="00:32:51.760" style="s2">right and you you so you look for</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">commonality</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.760" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">and you organize around the commonality</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">which is the love of that object be it</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">free software</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">or it&#39;s a bit similar to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:04.080" style="s2">you know i was reading an article in</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">jacobin magazine today about</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.080" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">you know how unions back in the day were</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">able to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">kind of unity between the workers of</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">different races and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">and and uh you know other differences</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:17.919" style="s2">because they were all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">had this common identity you know we</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.919" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">workers we will struggle together</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">it&#39;s good for us if we all fight</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">together around you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">uh some common priorities</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">uh as opposed to the fragmentation that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:33.679" style="s2">we that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">have right now um and you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.679" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">familiar with the work of uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">is it peter lindbergh with you know</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.039" end="00:33:52.080" style="s2">and are not seeing and reading any</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">anymore the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.080" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">things this is uh so i see commenting as</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">a potential</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">also strategy to overcome at least some</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">of that fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">by focusing on you know this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:05.919" style="s2">common</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">priority that we could have if we build</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.919" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">things together</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:10.639" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s really what we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">to work on but we have to be realistic</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.639" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">about the fact that these monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">attractors armed with</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">machine learning are not attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">do that and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">find ways to either overcome it and one</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">of the things for instance i find</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">facebook for instance for all of its</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:28.079" style="s2">evils if you stay out of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">broad public facebook and spend your</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.079" end="00:34:32.159" style="s2">time in private groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">many of the dynamics go away right they</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.159" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">don&#39;t run very many ads in the private</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">private groups have their own algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">which are objective actually and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">driven by the zuckerberg algorithm etc</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:45.679" style="s2">so one can</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:47.040" style="s2">adapt one&#39;s usage to not be quite as</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.679" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">sucked into these attractors the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.040" end="00:34:51.200" style="s2">one i&#39;d recommend to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.000" style="s2">turn the goddamn notifications off on</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.200" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">your devices</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.000" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">don&#39;t let them pop at you because they</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">are trying to get your attention</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">turn all the notifications off the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">two things i personally do which i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">recommend is i take a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">six-month break from social media every</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">year that&#39;s really good i should do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:11.920" style="s2">yeah in fact at the end of month two of</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">this year&#39;s break from july till the end</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.920" end="00:35:14.960" style="s2">of december</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:16.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s amazingly liberating and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.960" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">other is even when i am</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.240" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">on social media and this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">other things too like</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">email is once a week i take a day&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">break and have a cyber sabbath typically</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">on sunday</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">where i don&#39;t touch any device at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">except my kindle i have</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">like the good mennonites i say well</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">kindles are all right kindles are like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">book right</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:39.599" style="s2">and so again these are habits that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">can get into</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.599" end="00:35:43.520" style="s2">to free us at least a bit from cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.520" end="00:35:46.560" style="s2">let&#39;s go on now to a model that you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:49.440" style="s2">in the book</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.560" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">which is about how we can use this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.440" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">network infrastructure and other things</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">then you basically create a two by two</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.119" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">management consultant fashion uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.119" end="00:36:01.760" style="s2">centralized</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">versus global and you know for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.760" end="00:36:07.040" style="s2">versus for benefit and you have four</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">different boxes and maybe talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.040" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">right so so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">each quadrant by you know in turn and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">were just discussing is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">idea of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">centralized peer-to-peer infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:28.480" style="s2">with a for-profit goal so the facebooks</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">the googles they still</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.480" end="00:36:32.160" style="s2">do allow you know peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:37.599" style="s2">but everything except the front end</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">is actually centralized right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.599" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">centralized property</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">it&#39;s centralized governance they own</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">your data et cetera et cetera and and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:49.920" style="s2">we know where that is going and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:54.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not good news then the other one</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.920" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">is distributed but for profit</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.320" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">and he here&#39;s what i&#39;m thinking is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">bitcoin world the blockchain world</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">the crypto world because if you look for</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">example a bitcoin is very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:09.680" style="s2">you know as a commodity currency to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">up in value</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.680" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">so in other words it is designed to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">a profit</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">and the ideology behind it is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:20.960" style="s2">libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">ideology which you know sees every</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.960" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">individual as separate</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">from each other and then you can engage</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">in market transactions</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">what they don&#39;t see though is that any</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">competition for scarce resource</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">creates oligarchy</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">you know whether you&#39;re competing for</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">land or you&#39;re competing for money</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter in any</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">iterative game</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">uh for scarce resource one people</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">true luck and cleverness and hard work</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">whatever the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll end up having more resources than</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">the other and then for the next</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">iterative game you&#39;re stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">you&#39;re concentrating resources</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">and not only that but actually that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:03.119" style="s2">you know they&#39;re really designed to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">that right they have</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.119" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">oligarchic protocols like proof of stake</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">and proof of work which give</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">more to people already have so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a group apart which claims to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">peer-to-peer but actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">you know creates oligarchic systems in</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:21.520" style="s2">in their effects</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:22.480" style="s2">and then you have on the other side two</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.520" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">for benefit</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.480" end="00:38:28.800" style="s2">models and one is the local</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">distributed for benefit models and</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.800" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">that&#39;s really what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">urban commons</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:35.359" style="s2">you know there were 50 urban commons in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">the city of gentile 2008</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.359" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">and 500 in 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">so there is this explosion of local</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">initiatives you know faced with stated</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">market failure</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">people are really mutualizing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">of their provisioning system</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">and so what we saw in gen for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">was that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">every provisioning system had already a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">commons-based alternative</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:03.520" style="s2">whether it was a community land trust uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">housing co-ops and co-living</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.520" end="00:39:08.079" style="s2">arrangements</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">for housing whether it is uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.079" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">shared</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">transport uh but not uber but you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:16.160" style="s2">associations and co-ops that do similar</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">things but</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.160" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">way better uh whether it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:26.000" style="s2">uh you know shared the food like uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.800" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">collective purchasing uh you know with</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.000" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">farmers</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">for organic food so the whole field is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">is filled with those local bioregional</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">to do this kind of cosmo local</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">production and that brings us to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">and this is about the global open design</p>

<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">um you know i&#39;m looking forward to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:29.280" style="s2">protocol co-ops uh so to give you an</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">example of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.280" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this coalition called</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">of uh cities in the world which want to</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">example one of the things they would do</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:43.599" style="s2">is looking at regulations to rein in</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">uber and airbnb right but that&#39;s just a</p>

<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">one of the things i&#39;ve been proposing to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.760" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">the cities that i work for</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">is okay you create a global open design</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">depository for let&#39;s say share mobility</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">you make a deal with the coalition of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">cities you know like in the middle ages</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">the ancient league for example uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">you create you know ethical finance</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">impact finance coalition and you create</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">uh solidarity coming cooperative economy</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">social entrepreneurship</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">and with all of those things you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:41.040" style="s2">you know based on common protocols local</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">adaptations so that you can neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.040" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">transportation</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">much faster than any other you know way</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">could achieve so you see you have those</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:52.319" style="s2">four alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">it all depends how you design the cyber</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.319" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">physical infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">and ideally this is kind of my vision of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">you know i want an integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">best of the best so we have</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.720" end="00:42:09.760" style="s2">in open source and the commons we learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">how to do mutual coordination</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.760" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">right stigma energy the the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">see the signals</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">of all the others working in the same on</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">the same project</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">so that you can coordinate and adapt in</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">real time</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">to what others are doing market pricing</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">works very well</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:27.680" style="s2">you know for to allocate really scarce</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.680" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">and so we can work on generative markets</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">and finally you know what we call</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">orchestrated planning which is the role</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">of the state</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">but we can also imagine global</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">governance institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">for example the global thresholds</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.119" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">an allocations council which is proposed</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.280" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">by r3.o reporting 3.0 which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">actually holding its conference right</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">and the idea here that they propose is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">to have a council</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">of scientists monitoring the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">availability</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">of resources matter and energy</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">globally and then come to some some type</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.079" style="s2">of agreement</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:10.839" style="s2">about you know what is the fair</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.079" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">distribution of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.839" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">allocation rights uh and that would then</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:18.240" style="s2">be reflected in accounting systems right</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">so that you everywhere you would know</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.240" end="00:43:21.839" style="s2">how to use</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">resources without going over the planet</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.839" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">boundary so it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">the donut economy idea of cate wayworth</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">but integrated in in one</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">accounting system and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">despite my critiques</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">i still am very interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:39.599" style="s2">blockchain world because</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing is going from an</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">internet of communication to an internet</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">of transaction</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">right the distributed ledgers can</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:52.960" style="s2">allow us to create at scale</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">uh open ecosystems to produce something</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.960" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">together on a world scale both locally</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.319" style="s2">and globally</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">and to adapt to each other and to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.319" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">able to respect the planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:07.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of what i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">working on recently</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.200" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">yeah i think those are all important</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">things first thing i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">is public shared ledgers</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:15.839" style="s2">you know you didn&#39;t quite say it but</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll say it</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t like bitcoin i think bitcoin is</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:24.240" style="s2">bad it&#39;s a replication of bad patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">from the past it was explicitly based on</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.240" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">gold</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">and as you point out it makes the rich</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">richer it&#39;s got lots of other problems</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:32.240" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">consuming electricity at a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.240" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">level etc</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">so while it was a very important proof</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.920" end="00:44:39.440" style="s2">of principle</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">and in fact when i read the bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.440" end="00:44:42.560" style="s2">paper when satoshi put it out i read it</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know a few months after he</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.560" end="00:44:45.119" style="s2">published it i said</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">i slapped myself in the head so this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.119" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2"> brilliant why didn&#39;t i think of</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">that it&#39;s not that difficult actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">but it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">a brilliant innovation but the bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">implementation i would say</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:57.680" style="s2">much of the ethereum work though not all</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">of it is in the wrong direction as you</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.680" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">reinforcing kind of a libertarian hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">individualist dog</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">dog epic on the other hand blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">can be used</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:11.520" style="s2">in much more positive ways too and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">know i pointed before to the holochain</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.520" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">project we&#39;ve had arthur brock on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">show a couple of times to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">hollywood which is not a blockchain i</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">mean you know it&#39;s a distributed ledger</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">without being</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:26.400" style="s2">based on the blockchain oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:28.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a different style it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.400" end="00:45:30.160" style="s2">same general family but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.240" end="00:45:31.920" style="s2">you know very very different and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.160" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">really designed for what i would call</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.920" end="00:45:34.319" style="s2">mostly</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:35.599" style="s2">good purposes and then there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.319" end="00:45:37.359" style="s2">kind of things which are more</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.599" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">purely written on the blockchain such as</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.359" end="00:45:41.119" style="s2">the ocean protocol</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:42.960" style="s2">which is a very clever way for people to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.119" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">own and share their data</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">etc that&#39;s also we&#39;re looking at so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:48.400" style="s2">this is an area</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:49.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a big innovation and i hope we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.400" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">eventually produce</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">a major win for society and a tool kit</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">that we can add to work with</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">but not all examples are good we have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">curate</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">you know the tools that we use from this</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">domain yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s why i talk in in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">latest report about value sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:08.720" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">right so if you&#39;re libertarian you</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.720" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:13.680" style="s2">a commodity currency if you&#39;re common</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">oriented you think about the mutual</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">credit</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">currency um if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">a libertarian you think about smart</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">contracts</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re a commoner you think about</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:27.280" style="s2">ostrom contracts and you can make a list</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">of about a dozen things</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.280" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">that you know how you would differently</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">design a distributed ledger system</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">if you are inspired by common values</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">versus libertarian values</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s very important for</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:43.119" style="s2">people to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">technology is not just neutral</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.119" end="00:46:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s an active terrain of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:48.960" style="s2">struggle</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">or construction if you like that better</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.960" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">the way your values are are reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">the way you design that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">those systems which then will be</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">influencing everybody else who&#39;s using</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a simple thing you know you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">look at the internet right first is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">non-commissioned officers uh of the us</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">army</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">that stress that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:14.079" style="s2">peer-to-peer to survive</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">nuclear war it&#39;s taken over by</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:18.240" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">then it&#39;s taken over after 93 by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.240" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">public with the web</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:22.720" style="s2">with the web and then the companies take</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:24.640" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.720" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">you know with with introducing client</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.640" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">server</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">and then this the surveillance state you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">know uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">wants to control everything and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s one technology but it has different</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:38.480" style="s2">layers of design principles which are</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">actually not that much in harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.480" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">yeah could you send me the link to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">i want to make sure we put that on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:46.400" style="s2">episode page</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.839" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll do that sounds absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.400" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">you know a design ethos is what can help</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">technology liberate us not enslave us i</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">you know again we get deep into these</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">issues so we&#39;re kind of moving along</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">here in time i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.240" style="s2">move from this topic which we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">about probably for two hours</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">and move to your chapter four i</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">personally found this extremely</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">interesting and that was p2p in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">structure of world history in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">various</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">modes of production and organization of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">production and exchange which have</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:20.240" style="s2">happened over time</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">i do want to make sure we have plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.240" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">time for governance which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">something dear to my heart but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">spend at least a little bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">on your take on the p2p and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">structure of world history</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">right well so when i when i started</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">with the p2p foundation um in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">you know two-ish i started</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">with discovering the relational grammar</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">of alan page fisk</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">and he&#39;s the one and i i we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">it about</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">40 minutes ago who distinguished between</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:57.760" style="s2">commoning</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">working together on a common on a common</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.760" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">project that is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">shared resource the gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:05.520" style="s2">he calls it equality matching where you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">give something</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.520" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">that creates an inequality and a desire</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">to give back</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:14.839" style="s2">the market uh and then what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">authority ranking which is about</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.839" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">redistribution and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">and then i discovered the second author</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">uh which is called kojim karatani</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.160" end="00:49:29.599" style="s2">and he wrote an amazing book called</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">the structure of world history and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.599" end="00:49:33.839" style="s2">says</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">that you know these these things that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.839" end="00:49:39.359" style="s2">on page fisky mentions are actually also</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">active in history but in different modes</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.359" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">of combinations</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:45.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a dominant mode so</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">human history actually starts with a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.280" end="00:49:49.119" style="s2">common so you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:50.480" style="s2">very small tribal groups that usually</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.119" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">are nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.480" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">you know when the hunters come back with</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:56.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.079" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">let&#39;s say a deer it&#39;s not for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.240" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">hunters it&#39;s for the family</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">and there is a protocol for distribution</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:05.520" style="s2">of the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">and actually usually the hunter he gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.520" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">released because he has already the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">prestige</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">of the hunt but so you know the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">for everyone at the same time in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">particular group that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">very first modality of human exchange</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">uh as we get more complex bigger</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">uh you know bigger villages and tribal</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.599" style="s2">federations</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s where the gift economy comes in</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.599" end="00:50:34.480" style="s2">equality matching</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">because that&#39;s kind of social obligation</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.480" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">that allows you to pacify uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">you know tribal warfare because as long</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">as you can move along in small bands you</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">know you don&#39;t have to go to war you</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">just move out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">the world is big enough for everyone but</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:51.280" style="s2">once you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">uh tribal federations you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.280" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">gift economy</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">skips in then comes the what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">authority ranking so</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">once a tribe decides you know to invade</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">another tribe</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">well you can have a gift economy right</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s a form of domination</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">so you have to justify your domination</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">and basically it&#39;s going to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:15.760" style="s2">we protect you we bring advantages in</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">exchange for tribute and obedience</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.760" end="00:51:19.040" style="s2">and so according to your rank in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">hierarchy you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.040" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">more than another person in lower rank</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:27.200" style="s2">and finally market pricing and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:30.640" style="s2">another way to put it</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.200" end="00:51:33.680" style="s2">is that capitalism is a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.640" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">capital state and nation right</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.680" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">capital drives everything the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">accumulation of capital is the name of</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">the game</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">the state creates a framework in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">this can happen</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.040" end="00:51:47.440" style="s2">and is also the place for keeping a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">balance uh you know at the meta level</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.440" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">of society so the state has a double</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">role if you like</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">and the nation is is the community and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">they emerge at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:52:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s one system capital state nation</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:05.839" style="s2">and uh what i&#39;m saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.880" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">if you look at the micro foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.839" end="00:52:09.359" style="s2">open source</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">and peer production you might actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.359" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">deduce a new</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">combination which is values produced not</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:16.880" style="s2">in the market alone</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">but through all the contributions in</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.880" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">civil society</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.480" style="s2">so the value regime changes and becomes</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">common-centric</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.480" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">the commoners need to make a livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">and create livelihood organizations</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:30.480" style="s2">through a generative economy which</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">includes</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.480" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">you know market dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">and then you have these for benefit</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">associations like the linux foundation</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">and drupal association which you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:44.559" style="s2">manage the infrastructure of cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">and like a common good institution like</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">the states</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of transformation of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:50.000" style="s2">state so my political program if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:54.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.000" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">jim is to transform civil society</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.400" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">the market and the nation all at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:01.599" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">a modest little project very much and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.599" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">my first book was actually called</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">you know changing the world but of</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:08.880" style="s2">course i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:10.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to change what i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.880" end="00:53:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m saying that you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.240" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">all peers should be changing the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.280" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">and so i i would like to add something</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">to that so i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">very interested lately in what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">called wave pulse theories and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">societies move from one polarity to</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:33.200" style="s2">uh extractive periods of competition</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">usually tends to an overuse and a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">and that creates a pulse towards going</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">to the other</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">polarity which is a period of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">and healing of society and so you look</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">at society and you see this con</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">continuous polarity changing</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">and remarkably the commons is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">healing agent</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:58.880" style="s2">in regenerative periods</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a fantastic book by mark</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.880" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">whitaker</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">which is called ecological revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:07.119" style="s2">and the actual religions</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">and he basically shows us in the past</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.119" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">and he looks at china 12th century japan</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:17.760" style="s2">15th century and europe in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">8th century and he sees the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.760" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:22.520" style="s2">the system is in crisis like the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">the roman empire and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.520" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">mutualization at a big scale to heal the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">and so this was of course going on in</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">regionally limited periods within</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">regional planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.200" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">but now we have arrived at global</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">planetary boundaries and that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.160" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">that we have to achieve this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">next transformation</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">and it it we have to escape the pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">we have to escape the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">because we now have nowhere else to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:53.599" style="s2">then keep the planet</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">in a steady state right so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.599" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">of what you know a lot of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">uh thing is we tell you is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">some kind of degrowth period where</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">our amount of usage of matter energy has</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">to go down to a certain degree</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">part of what we save can go to solving</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">huge global problems that we have with</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:14.079" style="s2">you know people are homeless and still</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">hungry</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.079" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">and many places but the aim is to arrive</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:24.240" style="s2">at the steady state</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:27.839" style="s2">system where humanity knows what to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.240" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">of its bio in our capacity and so you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.839" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">could say that we have to move from</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:34.799" style="s2">a capital labor compact which was the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:37.200" style="s2">basis of the welfare state</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.799" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">to a compact between humanity and nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.200" end="00:55:42.079" style="s2">to recognition of our place</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">in web of life and towards interspecies</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">community you know collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">in maintaining uh you know the health of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">our planet</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of the challenge and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">believe that peer-to-peer dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">the commons are a crucial part of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:59.280" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">very good i mean a couple comments one</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.280" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">it strikes me that as you said we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">to avoid it this time without the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">right because we have too far to fall</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve built</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">a very high stack of infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">systems and should we</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">fall we&#39;re going to fall a very long way</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">we have used the power of this game a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">hierarchy as we would call it</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:23.839" style="s2">to allow population to grow to 8 billion</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">and if the hierarchy collapses</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.839" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">or if the underlying structures collapse</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">too rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:31.280" style="s2">many of those 8 billion people will die</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">i&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.280" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">second i think this is very important is</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">when people talk about d</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">growth i think that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:41.440" style="s2">perceived as overly simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">now you did caveat it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.440" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">absolutely critical that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:47.599" style="s2">degrow</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">our imposition on the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.599" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">powers of mother nature</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">and so you know we have to stop fossil</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">fuel use by</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">2050 probably we have to get better at</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">recycling</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:02.640" style="s2">metals and things but there&#39;s still lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">of room to grow</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.640" end="00:57:06.599" style="s2">quote unquote in ways that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">material i call that growth into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.599" end="00:57:10.720" style="s2">microcosm</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">rather than growth into the macrocosm</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.720" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">you know for instance</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">better poetry or a new song</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:20.319" style="s2">is growth in some sense right in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">friend tyson yonkoporta who&#39;ve had on</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.319" end="00:57:24.240" style="s2">the show three times</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:25.040" style="s2">he&#39;s of an australian indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.240" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.040" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">he says that in their culture they make</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">a big distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">increase and growth so for instance</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">if the crops you grow get better on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:39.599" style="s2">same land without any material inputs</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">but you just take good care of the land</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.599" end="00:57:42.799" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:45.040" style="s2">increase while if you open up new land</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.799" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">and destroy the native habitat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.040" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">and increase is better than growth and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">so i would</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">you know ask people have some nuance</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">about this that</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">degrowthing doesn&#39;t mean things can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">get better but they</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">require a different concept yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:01.599" style="s2">absolutely so one of the concepts that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">we use is</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.599" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">you know sustainable well-being which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">uh you know how can you actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">increase the well-being of people</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">within the framework of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:14.160" style="s2">of planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">and you know i fully agree with you i</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.160" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">mean that&#39;s you know i will not use the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">growth in my public communications</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:21.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">you know when people are struggling to</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.920" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">survive you&#39;re not gonna tell them that</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">they have to be even poorer</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not what this is about</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">this is about</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">you know stopping waste uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s about directing life</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">towards the growth of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:42.480" style="s2">make us really happy</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">so i just see the growth of the at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.480" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">material usage as a kind of objective</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">necessity</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s absolutely not a way to</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">communicate politically</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">about these these issues and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">i think commoning is also</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:58.799" style="s2">important because you know when you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">meaningful work in a group</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.799" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge boost to your to your</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">personal happiness right it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">it&#39;s an expression of your being and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things we can do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">go in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">that make people a lot happier than you</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">know the mere</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">accumulation of material stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">actually don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">that much yep absolutely and again</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">we both know that an awful lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">capital could be shared</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:28.480" style="s2">and you know things like tool libraries</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:30.640" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.480" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">transportation as a service run the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.640" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">right way</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">oh by the way i want to revisit that</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">even though we talked about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">last show</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">you talked about you know a better uber</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">there actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">are a few examples like in the city of</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">austin texas</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">about 50 of the market for rideshare is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">a driver-owned co-op which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:50.240" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:52.319" style="s2">but to your other point it would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.240" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">really nice if somebody documented how</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.319" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">they did it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:57.040" style="s2">and you know what their legal structures</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">were how they dealt with regulation etc</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">and make that available as a package for</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">other people around the world to be able</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:03.599" style="s2">to take those seeds and plant them</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.599" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what i call a protocol</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">cooperative you know because the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">protocols are publicly available and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:13.119" style="s2">can take them and adapt them to you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:16.400" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.119" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">other contexts interesting yep</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.400" end="01:00:20.000" style="s2">all right let me introduce another</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.839" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">concept here which is relatively new</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.000" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">i think quite new comes from one of my</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">collaborators a guy named jordan hall</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:31.240" style="s2">and he has five or six youtube videos</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">on the concept that he calls sivium</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.240" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">c-i-v-i-u-m</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:35.839" style="s2">so youtube civilian jordan hall will</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">bring it up</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.839" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s informed by the work of jeffrey</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">west and louise</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:44.079" style="s2">bettencourt who are both affiliated with</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">the santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.079" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">and their work showed in a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">convincing fashion</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">that cities are quite unlike biology</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:56.720" style="s2">biology is sublinear when an elephant</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">you compare an elephant to a mouse</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.720" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">an elephant might be ten thousand times</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">heavier but it does not use ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">times as much energy or</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">water it goes down at a sublinear</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:10.799" style="s2">scaling at the three-fourths power as it</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:12.880" style="s2">turned out and so maybe an elephant uses</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.799" end="01:01:14.880" style="s2">200 times the energy of a mouse even</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.880" end="01:01:17.359" style="s2">though it&#39;s 10 000 times bigger</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.880" end="01:01:18.000" style="s2">but the opposite is true for cities as</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.359" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">cities</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.000" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">get bigger they are super scalar in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">whole lot of dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">some positive and some negative for</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">instance we know</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">patents are generated at a higher rate</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">per capita</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">in larger cities economic wages are</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:35.599" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.880" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">in larger cities per capita but also</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.599" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">crime is higher and disease is higher</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">etc and so the super linearity</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">has some very interesting consequences</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">particularly and it&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:49.280" style="s2">why we&#39;re developing these</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">mega cities all around the world with</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.280" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">populations of 20 million or more and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">particularly in the third world</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:57.280" style="s2">many of them are fairly horrible places</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:57.680" style="s2">in terms of quality of life and impact</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.280" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.680" end="01:02:01.119" style="s2">the local environment at least and of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">course in the west</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.119" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">the super cities become dominant in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">economy in their region</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">are sucking resources in from all over</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:12.160" style="s2">causing people around the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">to degrade the environment and come up</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.160" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">against the limits</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:16.400" style="s2">and i would say at this point beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">limits of growth</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.400" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">and further this is i think the new</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">addition that jordan adds to</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">this analysis is that cities make people</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:25.119" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">you know you look at the rate of which</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.119" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">people go to psychotherapists you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">you look at</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:31.599" style="s2">and you just think about the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">life you have to live in a big city you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.599" end="01:02:34.240" style="s2">know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">looking down at your feet in the subway</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.240" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">not talking to your neighbor you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:38.400" style="s2">even know who your neighbor is in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:40.240" style="s2">apartment building</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">you deal with everything has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.240" end="01:02:43.760" style="s2">reduced to the transactions of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:46.799" style="s2">market or the government</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.760" end="01:02:48.319" style="s2">there is no face-to-face community most</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.799" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">people who move to the cities</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.319" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">don&#39;t bring their whole extended family</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">with them so they&#39;re social isolates</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">and so jordan has proposed taking some</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">of things you&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">the ability of the nets that we start to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:04.079" style="s2">recreate society from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">in small groups a few hundred people</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.079" end="01:03:09.680" style="s2">in the mostly rural areas that create</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:11.599" style="s2">extraordinarily high quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.680" end="01:03:14.000" style="s2">to the degree that&#39;s reasonable that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.599" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">they be self-contained with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.000" end="01:03:17.599" style="s2">things like power and water depending on</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">where they&#39;re located they may be able</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.599" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">to be self-sufficient with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:23.280" style="s2">food too but they also should be open to</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">the wider society to trade</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.280" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">for things that they can&#39;t do for</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:26.880" style="s2">instance they&#39;re not going to make their</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:28.960" style="s2">own computer chips</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">anytime soon or airplanes or other</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.960" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">things but</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">and this is the key so they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">contribute to the global</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">shall we say increase they need to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:38.480" style="s2">coupled to the wider world and to each</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:40.799" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.480" end="01:03:42.799" style="s2">so that they can have the good parts of</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.799" end="01:03:45.760" style="s2">superlinearity of large</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.799" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">groups of humans interacting and yet</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.760" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">still provide</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">a very humane and low impact quality of</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">and i find this synthesis completely</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">interesting and engaging</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">and have been starting to dig into it in</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:04:00.079" style="s2">some detail</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;d love to get your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.079" end="01:04:04.079" style="s2">idea that we can capture the good that</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.400" end="01:04:04.799" style="s2">comes from large groups of humans</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.079" end="01:04:07.280" style="s2">interacting</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.799" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">and yet build humane and low-impact ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.280" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">of living</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:13.839" style="s2">at the same time well it sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:17.440" style="s2">like you know our idea of cosmo local</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.839" end="01:04:19.200" style="s2">uh organization right which uh so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.440" end="01:04:21.440" style="s2">i look i mean i have opened the tabs</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.200" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve never actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.440" end="01:04:25.200" style="s2">taken the time yet to look at the you</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">know the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">series but it sounds like something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">is totally</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:33.280" style="s2">interesting i have some friends in</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">france who</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.280" end="01:04:37.119" style="s2">have calculated that if we want 100</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:39.039" style="s2">organic food</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.119" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">we need 12 percent of the people back in</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.039" end="01:04:43.520" style="s2">the countryside</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:44.640" style="s2">what we also have to know is that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.520" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">know italy</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.640" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">spain uh portugal</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:52.640" style="s2">france have you know hundreds and</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">hundreds of empty villages</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.640" end="01:04:56.319" style="s2">you know the villages are actually there</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:59.200" style="s2">nobody wants to live there anymore</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.319" end="01:05:01.839" style="s2">but you know if we can create a non-isil</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.200" end="01:05:03.599" style="s2">a non-isolated cultural life</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.839" end="01:05:06.079" style="s2">i think we could have this type of you</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.599" end="01:05:08.400" style="s2">know global global villages</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.079" end="01:05:10.160" style="s2">that are both local but you know also</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.400" end="01:05:11.839" style="s2">intensely connected</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.160" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">with the intellectual and cultural life</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.839" end="01:05:16.000" style="s2">of the world and i i think basically</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">with internet there is no reason</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.000" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">anymore to make that huge distinction</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:22.960" style="s2">between the countryside and the city</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">and i have a friend from the global</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.960" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">villages</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:29.680" style="s2">project it&#39;s called give g-i-v-e</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">which is doing a virtual university of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.680" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">the villages</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">because you know if you&#39;re in a village</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:38.160" style="s2">hard to get a good professor to come by</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:40.720" style="s2">and give a lecture</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.160" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">so they mutualize and they invite you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.720" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">know the best professors in austria</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">to teach uh people in the villages i i</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">think those kinds of things go in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">same direction of what jordan is</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:53.760" style="s2">trying to propose so i&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:55.280" style="s2">interested in learning more about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.760" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s i would point people</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.280" end="01:05:59.680" style="s2">to it is something that i would suggest</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:06:01.680" style="s2">is highly congruent with your ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.680" end="01:06:03.680" style="s2">then combines them with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.680" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">west betancourt findings about</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.680" end="01:06:06.559" style="s2">superlinearity of cities to produce what</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">pretty compelling way to think about</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">ways forward</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:13.280" style="s2">we&#39;re getting late here in time again</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:14.319" style="s2">damn it we have so much interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:17.119" style="s2">things to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.319" end="01:06:18.880" style="s2">and so little time let&#39;s move on to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.119" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">payoff chapter five</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.880" end="01:06:24.960" style="s2">a commons transition strategy</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.920" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">what do we need to do yes</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.960" end="01:06:31.520" style="s2">i can&#39;t exactly recall what i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">in that fifth chapter and i must say</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.520" end="01:06:34.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve been a bit</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">you know in a more doubtful mode because</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.559" end="01:06:37.119" style="s2">uh i think what we see happening is that</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.119" end="01:06:41.839" style="s2">social collapse is you know speeding up</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:44.640" style="s2">much faster than the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.839" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">ecological collapse and so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">political situation is becoming hugely</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.760" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">but so basically what i&#39;m advocating is</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">so new model and i focus around the idea</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">of partner state</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">and public commons cooperation protocols</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">so moving away from this idea of a</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:04.880" style="s2">top-down</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">state to an idea of a partnering</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.280" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">state and that can you know happen at</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">all levels including global governance</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:18.319" style="s2">but let me give you an example i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:20.559" style="s2">know if we did that last time but you</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.319" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">know you have the bologna regulation</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.559" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">for the care and regeneration of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:28.000" style="s2">urban commons</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:29.839" style="s2">it creates a lab it allows all</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.000" end="01:07:32.079" style="s2">citizens in the city to say i want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.839" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">care for this as a commons</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.079" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">so abandoned buildings you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:39.920" style="s2">parks that are not kept well uh even</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:41.920" style="s2">cleaning the the river</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:43.119" style="s2">sides and there&#39;s many many things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.920" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">can be done</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.119" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">and so the there&#39;s a process of</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:52.160" style="s2">negotiation validation</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:54.799" style="s2">then a commons accord is signed</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.160" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">and the city then becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.799" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">coordinator of the support</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">and they have this system called the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:03.039" style="s2">quintuple helix system</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:04.559" style="s2">which is the city the chamber of</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">commerce</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.559" end="01:08:10.160" style="s2">the research organizations and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.119" end="01:08:12.400" style="s2">official ngos and all these four</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.160" end="01:08:13.280" style="s2">combined together to help number five</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.400" end="01:08:16.719" style="s2">which are the</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.280" end="01:08:19.600" style="s2">common-centric uh social</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.600" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">model and it has been</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">copied by 250</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">other italian cities and it has</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:31.199" style="s2">mobilized one million</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:34.239" style="s2">italians in working for the commons</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.199" end="01:08:34.880" style="s2">at their local urban scale so i think</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.239" end="01:08:36.239" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.880" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">you know something that actually needs</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.239" end="01:08:39.759" style="s2">to be done everywhere because</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">if you recall what the maker movement</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.759" end="01:08:43.279" style="s2">was doing with covid</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:45.600" style="s2">you know they were very very fast at</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.279" end="01:08:47.359" style="s2">producing those things but then</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.600" end="01:08:49.120" style="s2">the hospitals were afraid to accept</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.359" end="01:08:50.640" style="s2">their their material because of all</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.120" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">kinds of legal</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.640" end="01:08:53.920" style="s2">and liability issues that they you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.920" end="01:08:57.759" style="s2">cross those lines and that is a huge</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">waste</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.759" end="01:09:02.799" style="s2">of uh you know potential in in value</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">so i think this is very important that</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">you know step away from the the binary</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:10.560" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">or market and move at least to a</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.560" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">triarchy</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:15.359" style="s2">where you know what&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">combination of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.359" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">economic activities from the market</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:21.600" style="s2">orchestrated planning and regulation</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:24.239" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:25.679" style="s2">the partner state and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.239" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">support</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.679" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">mechanisms and then of course the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">autonomous activity of the commoners</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">so that that for me is very important</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:38.640" style="s2">that we start moving in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">simultaneous transformation</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.640" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">of civil society the market and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:45.600" style="s2">state function</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:50.319" style="s2">using those concepts of public commons</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.600" end="01:09:51.920" style="s2">cooperation protocols and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i wrote anything else</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.920" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">there you had some other things but i</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.359" end="01:09:57.600" style="s2">think you hit the big picture</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">you know things i wonder about is trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.600" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">to do all three at once</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:03.679" style="s2">is that feasible i would say our game b</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:06.880" style="s2">movement at the present time</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.679" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">is focused on just doing proofs of</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.880" end="01:10:11.520" style="s2">principle at the local scale</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">and including some of jordan&#39;s civilian</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.520" end="01:10:15.440" style="s2">ideas on how the local communities</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">would have protocols for interacting</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.440" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">with themselves in the wider world</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">in a way to have a super scalar ability</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">have increase if not growth and leave</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:29.360" style="s2">the state reforms till later though as</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:31.920" style="s2">you point out the current</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.360" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">meta crisis may not let us do that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.920" end="01:10:35.280" style="s2">guess our perspective is that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:36.719" style="s2">politics is so broken</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.280" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">particularly in the united states but</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:40.800" style="s2">increasingly across the west</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:41.679" style="s2">that it may not be worth participating</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.800" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.679" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">partisan politics at this time yes i</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2">i fully agree it&#39;s difficult but i i i</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">think we still need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:52.080" style="s2">you know to to have an integrated</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">holistic approach</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.080" end="01:10:56.000" style="s2">and you know don&#39;t forget not everybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">has to do everything right so so</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.000" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">you know i i fully agree that you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re engaged in doing a local</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">project you know your energy is going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:06.000" style="s2">making that work</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">uh but i think at some point you do have</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:09.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:11.120" style="s2">you know create a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.040" end="01:11:13.440" style="s2">public authority and</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.120" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">you know at a local level it might not</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.440" end="01:11:17.520" style="s2">be as bad as at the national level right</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">all these games that national level</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.520" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">politicians can play</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">because they can put up one group</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">against another</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:26.960" style="s2">uh when you&#39;re at the local level you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:28.560" style="s2">know if there&#39;s a riot you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.960" end="01:11:32.320" style="s2">there&#39;s nowhere else to go</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.560" end="01:11:35.840" style="s2">right so there&#39;s i think a strong</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.320" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">motive for local politicians to behave</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.840" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">uh substantially differently than at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">national scale</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:43.920" style="s2">yeah absolutely and we do say that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">and i i&#39;m advocating the creation of</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.920" end="01:11:47.120" style="s2">assemblies of the commons and chamber of</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:49.920" style="s2">the commons</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.120" end="01:11:51.520" style="s2">and commons transition coalition so the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.920" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">first one assembly</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.520" end="01:11:55.920" style="s2">is where all the people who are engaged</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">in creating and protecting commons can</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.920" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">you know find each other</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">uh and you know arrive at the consensus</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:03.360" style="s2">of what needs to be happening in terms</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">of regulation</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.360" end="01:12:07.280" style="s2">and you know and then we have a chamber</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">of commerce which is all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.280" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">the livelihood organizations uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">how can we make healthy businesses</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:15.600" style="s2">around the commons</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:17.520" style="s2">uh and then the co the commons</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.600" end="01:12:19.280" style="s2">transition coalition is the people who</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.520" end="01:12:21.199" style="s2">have more of a political consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.280" end="01:12:23.440" style="s2">and and wants to work directly on those</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.199" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">regulations</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.440" end="01:12:27.040" style="s2">i frankly think we do need to do</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:30.640" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.040" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">at the same time and give you an example</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:34.840" style="s2">for example the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:36.000" style="s2">economy for the common good is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.840" end="01:12:39.600" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">um to create a common good accounting</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.600" end="01:12:43.280" style="s2">system with 17 classes of impact which</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">already exists</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.280" end="01:12:47.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve been doing this for 10 years and</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">when you have an investment policy</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.920" end="01:12:53.520" style="s2">you can start saying well we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:56.719" style="s2">going to invest and support</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.520" end="01:13:00.080" style="s2">those industries</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.719" end="01:13:01.920" style="s2">that have a positive impact right</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.080" end="01:13:03.199" style="s2">so you lower your taxes in higher</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.920" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">subsidies</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.199" end="01:13:07.120" style="s2">for generative businesses and you lower</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:10.560" style="s2">it for</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.120" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">degrading practices and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.560" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">you keep the companies you keep the ceos</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:17.520" style="s2">but you change the entire</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:19.600" style="s2">incentive system around them right</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.520" end="01:13:20.880" style="s2">so we need to find those things which</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.600" end="01:13:23.920" style="s2">can accelerate</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.880" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">the change so my view of companies is is</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.920" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">a bit</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.320" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">you know like can&#39;t live with them and</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">can&#39;t live without them so</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:32.719" style="s2">they have often a predatory dna</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:34.640" style="s2">but we&#39;re not going to get rid of them</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.719" end="01:13:35.280" style="s2">within 10 years which is what we need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.640" end="01:13:38.320" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.280" end="01:13:40.159" style="s2">for you know rapid transition so we need</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.320" end="01:13:43.199" style="s2">to find ways to work with them</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.159" end="01:13:45.440" style="s2">and guide them and push them with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.199" end="01:13:48.640" style="s2">framework that still allows them</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.440" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">maximum of freedom and autonomy but kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.640" end="01:13:52.159" style="s2">of guided by those regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.239" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.159" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">now this work on the chamber and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.239" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">assemblies is that actually happening</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.080" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">because i sense a strong interest in all</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">the various groups</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">that are working that are more or less</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.239" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">pointed in the same direction though</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">with different emphasis and different</p>

<p begin="01:14:17.440" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">it is happening at the others you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.280" end="01:14:24.880" style="s2">not big enough scale but for example</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">in france you have about at least 15 now</p>

<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">but they&#39;re essentially a place where</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.960" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">there&#39;s also more and more food</p>

<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:46.320" style="s2">there is even in france already a</p>

<p begin="01:14:46.320" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">which has prepared</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.719" end="01:14:59.920" style="s2">so what to do with habitat what to do</p>

<p begin="01:14:59.920" end="01:15:03.520" style="s2">so those things exist already like you</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.679" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">know if you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.520" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">commoning of housing you need a</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:11.280" style="s2">you need cooperative housing and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.560" end="01:15:13.040" style="s2">need co-housing right</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.280" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">those are three different models that</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.040" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">cover the ground</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.040" end="01:15:18.880" style="s2">the houses and the the functioning of</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.880" end="01:15:23.360" style="s2">internally so these things exist but</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.159" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">they need to be</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.360" end="01:15:27.920" style="s2">interconnected so we suffer from</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">fragmentation that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.920" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">yeah i would say i would go even a step</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:33.760" style="s2">further and say that while the commoners</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">and commenting is a great approach and</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:37.040" style="s2">has a lot of richness to it there are</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:39.040" style="s2">other approaches</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.040" end="01:15:40.080" style="s2">that are i think pointed in the same</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.040" end="01:15:42.080" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.080" end="01:15:43.520" style="s2">you know for instance the regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.080" end="01:15:45.199" style="s2">ecology movement</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.520" end="01:15:46.560" style="s2">it&#39;s similar but not the same and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.199" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">another one that i&#39;ve become quite</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.560" end="01:15:50.239" style="s2">interested in lately</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:51.840" style="s2">is political metamodernism the hansi</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.239" end="01:15:53.600" style="s2">frynack</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.840" end="01:15:55.040" style="s2">and our own game b i think fits in that</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.600" end="01:15:58.159" style="s2">category and i know a</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.040" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">half a dozen maybe a dozen more that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.159" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">each taking a somewhat different</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">approach</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:03.280" style="s2">but we can think of it as having a</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:05.040" style="s2">coherent pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:07.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a small group of things we agree</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.040" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">upon and there&#39;s a broader group of</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.040" end="01:16:11.440" style="s2">things we agree to disagree about</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:12.640" style="s2">and i think an association at that level</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.440" end="01:16:15.280" style="s2">could be really</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.640" end="01:16:16.719" style="s2">useful right at this time yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.280" end="01:16:19.040" style="s2">about measuring it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.719" end="01:16:20.719" style="s2">meshing perspectives you know each</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.040" end="01:16:21.840" style="s2">perspective brings something to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.719" end="01:16:24.480" style="s2">table</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.840" end="01:16:25.679" style="s2">that others didn&#39;t see but it also</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.480" end="01:16:28.159" style="s2">because of its filter</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.679" end="01:16:29.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see other things right and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.159" end="01:16:31.199" style="s2">the more perspective you can mesh</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.760" end="01:16:34.000" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.199" end="01:16:34.719" style="s2">the more you shine light on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.000" end="01:16:38.320" style="s2">problems and</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.719" end="01:16:40.880" style="s2">and the objects um and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.320" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t put ourselves in a situation</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.880" end="01:16:44.159" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:46.239" style="s2">we say you know all in the comments is</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.159" end="01:16:49.040" style="s2">the answer or only</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.239" end="01:16:49.679" style="s2">meta modernism is the answer but kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.040" end="01:16:52.320" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.679" end="01:16:53.760" style="s2">interconnect interweave uh those</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.320" end="01:16:56.640" style="s2">different approaches</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.760" end="01:16:58.080" style="s2">and then like discuss solutions and and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.640" end="01:17:00.239" style="s2">enrich the solutions be</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:01.679" style="s2">through this intermeshing of an</p>

<p begin="01:17:01.679" end="01:17:06.000" style="s2">i think that that would be uh you know a</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:07.679" style="s2">big way forward</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.000" end="01:17:08.800" style="s2">oh that&#39;s i&#39;m glad for you to hear that</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.679" end="01:17:10.239" style="s2">because i&#39;ve been talking to a number of</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:11.440" style="s2">people about this and they all say</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.239" end="01:17:13.920" style="s2">they&#39;re ready to do it</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.440" end="01:17:15.679" style="s2">and i may call some people together to</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.920" end="01:17:16.000" style="s2">try to get this rolling sometime early</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.679" end="01:17:17.760" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.000" end="01:17:19.120" style="s2">year and you will certainly be high on</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.760" end="01:17:21.679" style="s2">my list of people</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.120" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">i will be happy to participate ah very</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.679" end="01:17:23.920" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">well i think we&#39;re getting close to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.920" end="01:17:28.640" style="s2">end of our time here</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">any final thoughts on the way forward</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.640" end="01:17:32.960" style="s2">and particularly in the context</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:35.360" style="s2">of the suddenly pretty hot meta crisis</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.960" end="01:17:37.600" style="s2">we seem to be finding ourselves in</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.360" end="01:17:39.600" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a it&#39;s a real problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.600" end="01:17:41.920" style="s2">because i think we discussed it</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.600" end="01:17:42.880" style="s2">in private uh you know before we opened</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.920" end="01:17:45.199" style="s2">the recording</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.880" end="01:17:47.040" style="s2">um or maybe we discussed in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.199" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">beginning i can&#39;t remember sorry</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.040" end="01:17:52.880" style="s2">but the way social media are</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">weaponizing difference is</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.880" end="01:17:57.040" style="s2">extraordinarily disruptive</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:58.800" style="s2">um you know i&#39;m a curator i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.040" end="01:17:59.679" style="s2">pluralistic curator i&#39;ve done that all</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.800" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.679" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">and i&#39;ve never been under so much</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:06.080" style="s2">pressure to limit</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:07.040" style="s2">my sources and on both sides there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.080" end="01:18:10.560" style="s2">extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.040" end="01:18:12.159" style="s2">exaggeration where uh you know when i</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.560" end="01:18:14.159" style="s2">hear somebody on the right saying bernie</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.159" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">sanders is radical leftist you know i</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.159" end="01:18:18.159" style="s2">i&#39;m laughing because you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">scandinavia which is like</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.159" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">totally normal here in europe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:23.920" style="s2">nothing radical about it</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.679" end="01:18:26.159" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s already a 100 years old</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.920" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">right and the same way on the left</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.159" end="01:18:31.120" style="s2">you know like you know even the slight</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:32.880" style="s2">descent is not called outright</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.120" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">and and most people don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.880" end="01:18:39.840" style="s2">it means so this kind of inflation</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.360" end="01:18:41.199" style="s2">of demonization uh is a huge huge</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.840" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.199" end="01:18:45.760" style="s2">so i i i&#39;m very much for projects like</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.840" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">you know protopia lab</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.760" end="01:18:51.360" style="s2">or new discourses or or others that</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">the store are you know these these</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.360" end="01:18:54.080" style="s2">places where people can learn to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.600" end="01:18:56.640" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:58.560" style="s2">again because that&#39;s that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.640" end="01:18:59.920" style="s2">important if we</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.560" end="01:19:02.159" style="s2">you know if you have multiple</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.920" end="01:19:04.640" style="s2">perspectives and you know as a curator i</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.159" end="01:19:07.440" style="s2">do this every day</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.640" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">i look something up and i look first at</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.440" end="01:19:10.080" style="s2">the factual</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:11.120" style="s2">basis you know is this likely to be true</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.080" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">or not and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.120" end="01:19:14.719" style="s2">i can double check and triple check</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:17.040" style="s2">certain things</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.719" end="01:19:18.400" style="s2">but i also try to understand the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.040" end="01:19:20.840" style="s2">narrative frame right</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.400" end="01:19:22.880" style="s2">so how do these people come to these</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.679" end="01:19:51.199" style="s2">a certain degree</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.280" end="01:19:53.520" style="s2">what you can do in the comments is you</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.199" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">know put some difference on the brackets</p>

<p begin="01:20:01.120" end="01:20:04.560" style="s2">problem in this context</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.719" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">because we both want to have good free</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.560" end="01:20:10.400" style="s2">software you see what i mean</p>

<p begin="01:20:14.400" end="01:20:18.400" style="s2">certain things under brackets i mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.320" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">even people who believe in you know q</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.400" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">anom</p>

<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:27.360" style="s2">and you know i wouldn&#39;t agree with them</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.760" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">but as human beings i can have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.360" end="01:20:32.159" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">a respectful conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.159" end="01:20:36.080" style="s2">you know don&#39;t we need a good</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:38.159" style="s2">neighborhood don&#39;t we need to improve</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.080" end="01:20:40.639" style="s2">the schools don&#39;t you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.159" end="01:20:42.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of i think what needs to</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.639" end="01:20:44.159" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.080" end="01:20:45.600" style="s2">yeah i call that concept alignment</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.159" end="01:20:48.239" style="s2">beyond agreement</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.600" end="01:20:48.880" style="s2">that we can be in alignment with people</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.239" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.880" end="01:20:53.440" style="s2">some big picture things you know we may</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:54.800" style="s2">need to make human life more humane</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.440" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">right very few people i think would</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.800" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">disagree with that</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:20:59.520" style="s2">though we may disagree about the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:01.360" style="s2">techniques to get there and let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.520" end="01:21:03.600" style="s2">about our disagreements and</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.360" end="01:21:04.400" style="s2">as a librarian you know that one of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.600" end="01:21:06.000" style="s2">ways to help</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.400" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">make sense of disagreements is try to</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.000" end="01:21:10.000" style="s2">get to the facts first and that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">really breaking down in our society is</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.000" end="01:21:12.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">people have their own facts which is</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.239" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">extremely dangerous when people</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:18.159" style="s2">think that they have facts that are not</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:18.800" style="s2">compatible there&#39;s only one reality</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.159" end="01:21:21.600" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.800" end="01:21:24.000" style="s2">one set of facts is true and both sides</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.600" end="01:21:26.159" style="s2">need to back off of their tribalism</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:28.159" style="s2">unfortunately some people question that</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.159" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">very you know very basic</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.159" end="01:21:32.000" style="s2">fact yeah those are goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:34.080" style="s2">postmodernism which</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.000" end="01:21:35.360" style="s2">at least the flattened form i got no use</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.080" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">for there are some interesting things in</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.360" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:40.560" style="s2">but that one that all points of view are</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">equal is just ridiculous right</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.560" end="01:21:45.360" style="s2">or which doctor is not the same as johns</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">hopkins medical school sorry</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.360" end="01:21:49.360" style="s2">astronomy is not the same as astrology</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:51.840" style="s2">well we need some</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.360" end="01:21:52.960" style="s2">some uh you know common methodologies to</p>

<p begin="01:21:52.960" end="01:21:58.239" style="s2">differences right so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.159" end="01:22:01.679" style="s2">that has to be there otherwise we will</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.239" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">never make any progress on these issues</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.679" end="01:22:04.800" style="s2">well i think at that point we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:05.840" style="s2">to wrap up here michelle this has been</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.800" end="01:22:08.000" style="s2">again another</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.840" end="01:22:10.480" style="s2">remarkable conversation which i think</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.000" end="01:22:12.480" style="s2">will help the world actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.480" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">and you know i think we painted at least</p>
