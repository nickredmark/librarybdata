<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:08.910" style="s2">digital campfire where we go here and</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">dialogue about what matters most at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.910" end="00:00:13.099" style="s2">night&#39;s edge what&#39;s happening now</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.100" end="00:00:22.699" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.099" end="00:00:29.539" style="s2">okay I&#39;m ready mmm people still coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.699" end="00:00:35.150" style="s2">in all right so due to popular request I</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.539" end="00:00:40.250" style="s2">tried to side slay sidestep it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.150" end="00:00:43.280" style="s2">going to deal with lust today but before</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.250" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">we jump into that we need to step back</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.280" end="00:00:51.949" style="s2">in the middle and look at the common</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:55.839" style="s2">what we what we derive so far all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.949" end="00:00:58.820" style="s2">so we can then see that lust is actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.839" end="00:01:01.939" style="s2">in the same kind of sensory motor cycle</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.820" end="00:01:05.780" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s got some really cool</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.939" end="00:01:06.770" style="s2">features to it so I&#39;m going to start off</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.780" end="00:01:10.570" style="s2">by talking about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.770" end="00:01:13.670" style="s2">between effect perception and action</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.570" end="00:01:15.110" style="s2">they got to mention this over the course</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.670" end="00:01:18.530" style="s2">of the last two weeks but we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.110" end="00:01:22.370" style="s2">trying to summarize it here and that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.530" end="00:01:25.250" style="s2">that effect is an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.370" end="00:01:28.640" style="s2">motivational state it could be sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.250" end="00:01:32.020" style="s2">it&#39;s called a mood or you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.640" end="00:01:35.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it Prime&#39;s you effect Prime&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.020" end="00:01:39.140" style="s2">to move somehow right and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.930" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">these different qualities of aspect we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.140" end="00:01:48.920" style="s2">we talked about last week so we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:52.240" style="s2">the basic core self we&#39;re going to call</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.920" end="00:01:56.710" style="s2">it the sensory motor cycle is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.240" end="00:02:00.770" style="s2">effective energy arises it moves toward</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.710" end="00:02:02.870" style="s2">perception perception is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.770" end="00:02:04.909" style="s2">in the in our Western tradition we talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.870" end="00:02:07.190" style="s2">about perception a very passive way like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.909" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">your eyes are just receiving light and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.190" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">sound ways they&#39;re just bouncing off</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:14.629" style="s2">your ears this is not exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:18.159" style="s2">happens your perceptual organs are</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.629" end="00:02:21.799" style="s2">primed biathlete to go somewhere right</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.159" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">they&#39;re evolved to go somewhere so this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.799" end="00:02:29.330" style="s2">is why for example if you are you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">like phantom</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.330" end="00:02:34.730" style="s2">when syndrome all these things or if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:36.950" style="s2">if you if you do dark cave meditation</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.730" end="00:02:38.540" style="s2">and you robbed your eyes a sensory</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.950" end="00:02:42.350" style="s2">stimulation you&#39;ll start to hallucinate</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:45.470" style="s2">because they they have an active core to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.350" end="00:02:48.050" style="s2">them also right they will be primed by</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.470" end="00:02:52.460" style="s2">what are other effect is operating in</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.050" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">you to go somewhere and absent the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.460" end="00:02:58.910" style="s2">they will you can feel that aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:01.490" style="s2">sensory perception and hallucination and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.910" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">stuff because that&#39;s the movement toward</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.490" end="00:03:07.220" style="s2">the world okay so we have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">this is how we understand these things</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.220" end="00:03:12.860" style="s2">as a process from a process</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:15.410" style="s2">phenomenological standpoint so we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.860" end="00:03:20.270" style="s2">an effective energy than we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.410" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">perception and in that cycle in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.270" end="00:03:25.100" style="s2">the sensory motor core wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">discharge as action right it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.100" end="00:03:30.530" style="s2">discharges the energies cathartic and</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:33.709" style="s2">anew so you know these are micro cycles</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.530" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">and new cycles come up that&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.709" end="00:03:40.700" style="s2">a low centric mode the energy comes from</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:42.440" style="s2">the world you know your gut biome and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.700" end="00:03:44.989" style="s2">whatever the situation in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.440" end="00:03:47.930" style="s2">through your stimulation configures your</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.989" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">effective system which is also part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.930" end="00:03:53.750" style="s2">your vagus system in your homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">and all of that and then that Prime&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.750" end="00:03:59.239" style="s2">perception and that discharges this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:02.890" style="s2">action in the world we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.239" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">story and we can see story is the inward</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.890" end="00:04:08.060" style="s2">curving of that arc</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:10.430" style="s2">so from effect it doesn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.060" end="00:04:13.790" style="s2">perception it starts to curve inward</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.430" end="00:04:17.239" style="s2">into story into the virtualization could</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.790" end="00:04:21.080" style="s2">be image or story okay and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.239" end="00:04:23.390" style="s2">the egocentric pathway these are neural</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.080" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">phenomena logically distinct pathways if</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:27.140" style="s2">you want to read about them there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:30.140" style="s2">book called Zen in the brain by James</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.140" end="00:04:32.990" style="s2">Austin&#39;s really excellents a very big</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.140" end="00:04:35.240" style="s2">book but these two pathways the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.990" end="00:04:37.720" style="s2">allocentric and the egocentric pathway</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.240" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">are distinct</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.720" end="00:04:44.820" style="s2">they&#39;ve done these perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:44.820" style="s2">experiences that show</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.879" end="00:04:50.149" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:55.249" style="s2">anyways they&#39;re very they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.149" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">distinct people who have brain lesions</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.249" end="00:05:01.369" style="s2">that cut off the egocentric pathway I</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:03.649" style="s2">can&#39;t find they have these mystical</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.369" end="00:05:06.259" style="s2">experiences because the egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.649" end="00:05:09.399" style="s2">pathway Orient&#39;s the world towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.259" end="00:05:11.749" style="s2">yourself the allopathic sand pathway</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.399" end="00:05:15.199" style="s2">Orient&#39;s objects in space without</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.749" end="00:05:18.589" style="s2">reference to the self right so mountain</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.199" end="00:05:20.599" style="s2">climbers who have hypoxia they often</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.589" end="00:05:22.159" style="s2">have this thing called you know no head</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.599" end="00:05:26.449" style="s2">syndrome because they lose the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.159" end="00:05:28.849" style="s2">egocentric pathway and this this notion</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.449" end="00:05:32.110" style="s2">of pointing back to yourself doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.849" end="00:05:36.189" style="s2">exist and you have this like 360</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.110" end="00:05:41.089" style="s2">panoramic surround perceptual bleed</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.189" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">where you and the perception are one</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.089" end="00:05:46.539" style="s2">taste really right so these are actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:52.519" style="s2">neuro phenomenologically distinct so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.539" end="00:05:55.579" style="s2">more so that would be the curve into</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.519" end="00:06:01.029" style="s2">virtual space following the egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.579" end="00:06:03.879" style="s2">pathway and then that curving in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.029" end="00:06:07.430" style="s2">creates the narrative self imputes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.879" end="00:06:10.819" style="s2">default self that so we have the core</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.430" end="00:06:12.709" style="s2">self and it&#39;s sensory motor that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.819" end="00:06:14.569" style="s2">perception action cycle and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.709" end="00:06:16.969" style="s2">the false ass self which is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.569" end="00:06:22.309" style="s2">imputation into the virtual reality in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.969" end="00:06:25.819" style="s2">the story so and then we&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.309" end="00:06:29.419" style="s2">third mode so when we look at lust this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.819" end="00:06:36.699" style="s2">way one of the things I said last week</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.419" end="00:06:39.589" style="s2">is lust is the the care the seeking and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.699" end="00:06:42.409" style="s2">the connection the seeking and the play</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.589" end="00:06:46.759" style="s2">mastery there there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.409" end="00:06:49.009" style="s2">their semi independence they certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.759" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">interact with each other but the lust</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.009" end="00:06:57.669" style="s2">pathway seems to not be its own thing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:07:00.070" style="s2">seems to take all those three things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.669" end="00:07:02.170" style="s2">prime them for a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.070" end="00:07:05.200" style="s2">action right so when you think of lust</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.170" end="00:07:07.870" style="s2">it&#39;s driven by care right and panic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.200" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">all tied up into that and it&#39;s driven by</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.870" end="00:07:13.150" style="s2">a connection and it&#39;s driven by play and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.240" end="00:07:15.580" style="s2">anger a lot and it&#39;s driven by you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.150" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">it&#39;s driven by what&#39;s the third one fear</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.580" end="00:07:23.860" style="s2">seeking and fear so somehow lost</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:28.540" style="s2">catalyzes all the other effects you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.860" end="00:07:31.170" style="s2">and complexify the situation the more of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.540" end="00:07:35.140" style="s2">those that are online the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.170" end="00:07:38.440" style="s2">polymorphic kind of lust you have write</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.140" end="00:07:41.530" style="s2">them and so so now you have the this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.440" end="00:07:44.920" style="s2">somehow lost has got all these things</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.530" end="00:07:47.020" style="s2">engaged toward an object discharged an</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.920" end="00:07:51.640" style="s2">object in the world though it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.020" end="00:07:54.060" style="s2">meet the world which is no okay so let</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.640" end="00:07:54.060" style="s2">me go slow</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.189" end="00:07:59.870" style="s2">okay let me back up and answer this</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.430" end="00:08:02.810" style="s2">egocentric is effect instead of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.870" end="00:08:06.469" style="s2">discharging into perception it curves</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.810" end="00:08:09.020" style="s2">into the mind it curves into thought and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.469" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">then you create your it doesn&#39;t even get</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.020" end="00:08:15.860" style="s2">to perception its truncated at that part</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:20.259" style="s2">of the sensory motor cycle you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.860" end="00:08:22.550" style="s2">people who like as I said that one week</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.259" end="00:08:24.110" style="s2">you know I meet people who work with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.550" end="00:08:26.750" style="s2">horses and they&#39;re almost gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.110" end="00:08:28.370" style="s2">kicked and then I say like how would you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.750" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">know if you&#39;re in danger and then while</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.370" end="00:08:34.849" style="s2">I go inside you know they don&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.860" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">their they don&#39;t use their perception</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.849" end="00:08:42.890" style="s2">this is this is a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:45.649" style="s2">meditation if not done correctly we end</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.890" end="00:08:47.870" style="s2">up creating people who are looping</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.649" end="00:08:49.570" style="s2">inside their own kind of manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.870" end="00:08:53.839" style="s2">reality for ever and ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.570" end="00:08:55.370" style="s2">yeah okay yeah these these little</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.839" end="00:08:57.910" style="s2">questions that you know in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.370" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">sessions go fast and they talk to us so</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.910" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">heads up for the liking system in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:16.760" style="s2">lust system in I don&#39;t think pan except</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:23.750" style="s2">says like there&#39;s care and nurture he</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:31.699" style="s2">has he has fear play seeking care panic</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.750" end="00:09:35.060" style="s2">and lust okay so in terms of the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.699" end="00:09:38.060" style="s2">chemistry of it they&#39;re not distinct</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.060" end="00:09:42.019" style="s2">chemicals they&#39;re distinct cocktails of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:45.170" style="s2">those chemicals so if you think of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.019" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">at a cocktail bar the bartender only has</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.170" end="00:09:49.550" style="s2">so many things to use but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.910" end="00:09:51.470" style="s2">combinations and the amounts and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.550" end="00:09:58.040" style="s2">order that they come and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.470" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">will make will make a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.040" end="00:10:01.730" style="s2">effect okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:04.339" style="s2">so there&#39;s actually only a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.730" end="00:10:06.940" style="s2">neuro chemicals and even those neuro</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.339" end="00:10:06.940" style="s2">chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.130" end="00:10:13.280" style="s2">the same molecules so it&#39;s very fine to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.940" end="00:10:15.380" style="s2">complex it out of simple rules and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.280" end="00:10:20.270" style="s2">know that from complexity theory simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.380" end="00:10:22.760" style="s2">rules generate complex processes complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.270" end="00:10:24.740" style="s2">rules generate complicated situations</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.760" end="00:10:26.360" style="s2">right so we&#39;re building on simple rules</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.740" end="00:10:30.080" style="s2">these are all really good questions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.360" end="00:10:35.630" style="s2">it&#39;s good because then like you take our</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.080" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">time to get to lust okay so less would</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.630" end="00:10:40.370" style="s2">be the same thing there&#39;s some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:43.970" style="s2">an effect energy and what I described it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.370" end="00:10:47.060" style="s2">as this is my guess I mean doing my own</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.970" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">arrow phenomenology it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.060" end="00:10:53.330" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s driven by seeking</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:58.520" style="s2">when you&#39;re lusting the seeking drive is</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.330" end="00:11:02.750" style="s2">really on and so is the the care panic</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.520" end="00:11:07.220" style="s2">you know that you can in and the play</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.750" end="00:11:09.050" style="s2">anger is really right there right there</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.220" end="00:11:12.920" style="s2">in the cocktail right there in the mix</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.050" end="00:11:16.580" style="s2">so does that resonate with everyone I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.920" end="00:11:20.050" style="s2">mean this is why all those types of</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.580" end="00:11:22.490" style="s2">sexual experiences are there all those</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.050" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">you know and then a lot of times after</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.490" end="00:11:28.340" style="s2">the sexual after orgasm they all come</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">flooding in the lust is gone and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.340" end="00:11:32.570" style="s2">these you know what other your typology</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:35.660" style="s2">is you could start crying or you could</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.570" end="00:11:38.900" style="s2">start sometimes I mean men and women you</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.660" end="00:11:41.830" style="s2">get really angry right because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.900" end="00:11:46.130" style="s2">these these dreams are somehow</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.830" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">highlighted in interrupted by lust you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.130" end="00:11:56.270" style="s2">could think of lust as the main stallion</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:57.950" style="s2">and you know he&#39;s you know normally all</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.270" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">the herd is just eating doing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.950" end="00:12:02.030" style="s2">things then the main stallion starts to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:04.070" style="s2">drive them all there&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.030" end="00:12:09.640" style="s2">that that everything comes online and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.070" end="00:12:12.470" style="s2">your perception comes online you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.640" end="00:12:17.480" style="s2">more to everything is heightened right</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.470" end="00:12:19.490" style="s2">so you you&#39;re piling your your eyes you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.480" end="00:12:21.709" style="s2">might find yourself staring at certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.490" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">parts of the body</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.709" end="00:12:30.519" style="s2">your smell is just usually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:35.959" style="s2">passive comes online taste is really</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.519" end="00:12:38.540" style="s2">activated the desire the oral desire in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.959" end="00:12:40.700" style="s2">your mouth is highly activated all these</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.540" end="00:12:44.209" style="s2">things so this again is that effect</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.700" end="00:12:48.589" style="s2">coming in in priming the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.209" end="00:12:51.709" style="s2">organs and what the way I just described</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.589" end="00:12:54.440" style="s2">it the perceptual organs there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.709" end="00:12:57.170" style="s2">different perceptual organs that are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.440" end="00:13:00.200" style="s2">usually passive in our society that come</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.170" end="00:13:03.350" style="s2">online like the or you know the mouth</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.200" end="00:13:06.380" style="s2">obviously the genitals obviously your</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.350" end="00:13:08.450" style="s2">ear loves all these little points that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.380" end="00:13:10.790" style="s2">know usually just kind of like chill</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.450" end="00:13:13.010" style="s2">right so somehow it also prawns</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.790" end="00:13:19.010" style="s2">different out so then all we can start</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.010" end="00:13:21.110" style="s2">to look at our body as having it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.010" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">of it because perceptual organs right</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.110" end="00:13:29.300" style="s2">these these little places we all know of</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:31.579" style="s2">some no more of them than others and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.300" end="00:13:34.579" style="s2">start to see that there&#39;s a polymorphic</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.579" end="00:13:38.060" style="s2">kind of perceptual field that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.579" end="00:13:40.790" style="s2">activated with lust that is not so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.060" end="00:13:50.209" style="s2">activated by the other ethics dreams</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.790" end="00:13:52.270" style="s2">does that make sense yeah so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.209" end="00:13:54.709" style="s2">thing the other thing we want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.270" end="00:13:58.279" style="s2">interests in terms of the note the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.709" end="00:14:01.940" style="s2">other the normal the non lustful the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.279" end="00:14:07.790" style="s2">virtuous Alex you&#39;re a Catholic versus</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.940" end="00:14:14.029" style="s2">the simple ones is all ethics also have</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.790" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">something called another way to put it I</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.029" end="00:14:18.500" style="s2">called it effect perception action the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:22.269" style="s2">other way we can look at it that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.500" end="00:14:26.089" style="s2">of this is desire duration and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.269" end="00:14:28.220" style="s2">satisfaction now this touches on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.089" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">a hot question what did she ask wait I</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.220" end="00:14:34.260" style="s2">got to go to this sexually turn-on by</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">ideas yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.260" end="00:14:42.780" style="s2">what&#39;s that called sapiosexual yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:44.820" style="s2">mean I think you&#39;re just working with</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.780" end="00:14:46.140" style="s2">the we&#39;re gonna go into Tantra at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.820" end="00:14:49.530" style="s2">end of this and I think we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.140" end="00:14:56.040" style="s2">that then when we go from Tantra to just</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.530" end="00:14:58.430" style="s2">ideas yeah those are Donwood causation</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.040" end="00:15:00.690" style="s2">and then there&#39;s something else okay so</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.430" end="00:15:02.820" style="s2">we&#39;re on our way there to answering that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.690" end="00:15:05.280" style="s2">so we can also look at this as desired</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.820" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">duration and satisfaction now robber</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.280" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">barons work he this is what he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">to get at he&#39;s trying he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:19.530" style="s2">something like there is and there is no</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:21.930" style="s2">such thing as non-attachment or not</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.530" end="00:15:23.640" style="s2">desired he has a cool phrase right that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.930" end="00:15:26.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to remember because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.640" end="00:15:30.150" style="s2">saying that every moment of perception</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.010" end="00:15:35.870" style="s2">is actually a desire okay so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.150" end="00:15:40.200" style="s2">desire false lust is fetishism okay so</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.870" end="00:15:41.970" style="s2">that and and we can talk about that let</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.200" end="00:15:48.600" style="s2">me let me make sure I get to how that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.970" end="00:15:50.460" style="s2">works so you know and he he&#39;s working in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.600" end="00:15:53.700" style="s2">this realm where he&#39;s noticing even</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.460" end="00:15:55.260" style="s2">every act of perception has a desire in</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.700" end="00:15:58.670" style="s2">it and that has to do with this notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.260" end="00:16:07.290" style="s2">of wanting to go somewhere being primed</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.670" end="00:16:11.640" style="s2">to meet the world right so so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.290" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">start paying attention you noticed like</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.640" end="00:16:15.990" style="s2">if you&#39;re kind of letting your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:18.150" style="s2">wander outside in nature there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.990" end="00:16:22.200" style="s2">greens that feel like wow that really</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.150" end="00:16:28.050" style="s2">satisfied my eyes like you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.200" end="00:16:32.460" style="s2">feel the subtle movement of perception</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.050" end="00:16:34.890" style="s2">toward satisfaction and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.460" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">experience this very well because all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.890" end="00:16:39.000" style="s2">our language and the way we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">our sexual our sexual organs our which</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.000" end="00:16:42.990" style="s2">you could become eyes will say like our</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:45.090" style="s2">perceptual organs our sexual organs</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.990" end="00:16:48.590" style="s2">because they all work the same way does</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.090" end="00:16:48.590" style="s2">design that seek satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.630" end="00:16:55.060" style="s2">same with sound if you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.260" end="00:16:58.270" style="s2">Mozart was great at this a Bach even</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.060" end="00:17:01.270" style="s2">better he could set up a symphony so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.270" end="00:17:02.590" style="s2">were dying for a certain tone that he</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.270" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t give you and he wouldn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.590" end="00:17:07.300" style="s2">you and he wouldn&#39;t give you until</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:10.589" style="s2">finally gives you there&#39;s great books</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.300" end="00:17:13.690" style="s2">written about the this technique and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.589" end="00:17:17.530" style="s2">when he wrote one of his symphonies I</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.690" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">can&#39;t remember it might be the the</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.030" end="00:17:27.310" style="s2">goes on and on and on for like 45</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:29.560" style="s2">minutes at the end and you&#39;re just dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.310" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">for the resolution and then he slightly</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.560" end="00:17:35.310" style="s2">changes the pitch to a fifth and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:38.620" style="s2">this and that when he first showed that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.310" end="00:17:41.470" style="s2">there was a riot because people thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.620" end="00:17:44.260" style="s2">it was too sexual it&#39;s the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.470" end="00:17:47.940" style="s2">it&#39;s too sexual it&#39;s this too designer</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.260" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">than the duration this is the Tantra and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.940" end="00:17:54.250" style="s2">then the satisfaction of the desire okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:56.530" style="s2">and all perception is like this I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.250" end="00:18:00.840" style="s2">showed you that music is it&#39;s all like</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.530" end="00:18:00.840" style="s2">this so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.970" end="00:18:09.450" style="s2">so lust isn&#39;t different than that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.129" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">just that the object of satisfaction is</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.450" end="00:18:17.830" style="s2">specific in certain sense you know we</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.629" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to talk about the bones of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.830" end="00:18:22.120" style="s2">this but the objects of satisfaction is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.629" end="00:18:25.860" style="s2">specific and it&#39;s and it&#39;s all across</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.120" end="00:18:28.539" style="s2">the board I mean there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.860" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">you know there&#39;s I forget what the name</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.539" end="00:18:33.279" style="s2">of it there are people who are zoo you</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:34.929" style="s2">know they&#39;re objects of satisfaction or</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.279" end="00:18:36.580" style="s2">animals there are people who are like</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.929" end="00:18:39.879" style="s2">fall in love with machines like and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.580" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">really sexual that I don&#39;t understand I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.879" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">don&#39;t understand we&#39;re the imagistic you</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:55.330" style="s2">know how this is this is same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:57.789" style="s2">homosexuality how the object of that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.330" end="00:18:59.950" style="s2">is set in the mind I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.789" end="00:19:04.570" style="s2">that but some but it&#39;s up but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.950" end="00:19:08.110" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s many many varieties of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.570" end="00:19:12.179" style="s2">the object that creates a satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.110" end="00:19:15.279" style="s2">is in lust</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.179" end="00:19:22.149" style="s2">just like in sounds and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.279" end="00:19:26.649" style="s2">so so then we have so then we have so</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.149" end="00:19:28.870" style="s2">the egocentric mode which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.649" end="00:19:30.879" style="s2">you masturbate we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.870" end="00:19:35.710" style="s2">egocentric mode when it turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.879" end="00:19:38.019" style="s2">into a a story okay so that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.710" end="00:19:40.740" style="s2">else because if you masturbate you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.019" end="00:19:45.970" style="s2">make the object where they called</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.740" end="00:19:47.740" style="s2">autoeroticism auto-erotic homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.970" end="00:19:49.629" style="s2">or transgender that&#39;s contra points</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.740" end="00:19:53.409" style="s2">talks about it like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.629" end="00:19:56.830" style="s2">different than imagining you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.409" end="00:20:00.740" style="s2">someone using an imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.830" end="00:20:03.140" style="s2">masturbating because that that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.740" end="00:20:08.450" style="s2">the object of it is still this other</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.140" end="00:20:10.220" style="s2">object okay then we go on to Tantra but</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.450" end="00:20:13.730" style="s2">let me see what questions look</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.220" end="00:20:16.100" style="s2">appropriate here yeah there is a book</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.730" end="00:20:19.130" style="s2">about this Bach manipulating thing I</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.100" end="00:20:23.409" style="s2">wrote I wrote it I read it a long time</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.130" end="00:20:31.370" style="s2">ago if I find it I&#39;ll send it off to</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.409" end="00:20:38.980" style="s2">Peter or just you know if I can find the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.370" end="00:20:44.149" style="s2">music I have it here I think it&#39;s his I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.980" end="00:20:54.649" style="s2">find what music it is yeah Robert Baird</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.149" end="00:20:57.529" style="s2">I&#39;d recently okay yeah it&#39;s a desiring</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.649" end="00:21:00.940" style="s2">to know is something in this action</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.529" end="00:21:07.090" style="s2">perception perception cycle okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.940" end="00:21:10.370" style="s2">Tantra so Tantra obviously is not</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.090" end="00:21:13.730" style="s2">curving the desire into a thought and</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.370" end="00:21:16.909" style="s2">worrying or whatever or having some kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.730" end="00:21:20.120" style="s2">of mental masturbation but it&#39;s holding</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.909" end="00:21:23.090" style="s2">open this duration between the desire</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.120" end="00:21:26.630" style="s2">and the object it&#39;s just living in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.090" end="00:21:31.640" style="s2">so those of you who did my course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.630" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">still hunting you just still hunt for as</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.640" end="00:21:41.000" style="s2">long as you can and if you do this with</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:43.220" style="s2">another person the energies cohere</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.000" end="00:21:45.740" style="s2">become resonant incoherent in a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.220" end="00:21:49.429" style="s2">which this increases the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.740" end="00:21:50.929" style="s2">course this is something that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.429" end="00:21:54.950" style="s2">only have a certain capacity you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.929" end="00:21:57.289" style="s2">your nervous system your the narrow</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.950" end="00:22:04.309" style="s2">dynamics you have to build capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.289" end="00:22:07.250" style="s2">this and while you&#39;re doing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.309" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">also vulnerable to in in chigo and they</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.250" end="00:22:14.360" style="s2">call it microcosmic orbit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:17.430" style="s2">vulnerable to</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.190" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">upwelling these other kinds of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.879" end="00:22:27.229" style="s2">content because all those other FX</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:29.419" style="s2">dreams are also searching for</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.229" end="00:22:34.279" style="s2">satisfaction so you&#39;re holding all this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.419" end="00:22:38.029" style="s2">open and and you know wants a story or</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.279" end="00:22:40.879" style="s2">it wants some you know so it&#39;s it can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.029" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">like detoxifying because if you can if</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.879" end="00:22:46.639" style="s2">you can maintain it because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:50.389" style="s2">you&#39;re cleansing out all the available</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.639" end="00:22:53.449" style="s2">objects that can cause X is Freud would</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.389" end="00:22:57.919" style="s2">say the energy until you can just have</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.449" end="00:23:00.409" style="s2">free flow energy and because for lust it</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.919" end="00:23:02.569" style="s2">heightens all of those if you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.409" end="00:23:07.249" style="s2">something in your care connection or</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.569" end="00:23:12.489" style="s2">fear or panic then then that will tend</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.249" end="00:23:12.489" style="s2">to present itself in Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.120" end="00:23:21.030" style="s2">so it&#39;s about expanding this duration</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.770" end="00:23:25.080" style="s2">that&#39;s different in fetishes and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.030" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">fetishism is projecting that on an</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.080" end="00:23:29.670" style="s2">object of desire and then telling you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t have it that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.670" end="00:23:40.010" style="s2">different type of attachment or pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:46.110" style="s2">that has to do with psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.010" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">incoherence it&#39;s very similar to those</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.110" end="00:23:51.720" style="s2">those experiments they did a long time</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">ago with with rats where if you</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.720" end="00:23:54.870" style="s2">randomized when they get shot you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.920" style="s2">you go crazy</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.870" end="00:24:01.980" style="s2">so fetishism is kind of like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.920" end="00:24:04.290" style="s2">it&#39;s because it&#39;s a double bind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.980" end="00:24:06.870" style="s2">it&#39;s increasing your desire for</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.290" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">something and saying you&#39;re not allowed</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.870" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">to have it at the same time but then</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:13.170" style="s2">you&#39;re a passive kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:15.510" style="s2">manipulated in that this is different</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.170" end="00:24:20.120" style="s2">than being an active participant in</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.510" end="00:24:20.120" style="s2">holding open the duration of your desire</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.650" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">yeah now the interesting thing about all</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.410" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">of this is that if you hold open the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:56.690" style="s2">duration of that desire long enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.070" end="00:25:03.080" style="s2">something rather marvelous can happen</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.290" end="00:25:15.300" style="s2">and to talk about that I first want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:17.860" style="s2">go you know go over use a few more</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.300" end="00:25:29.680" style="s2">terminology so we can understand this</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.860" end="00:25:32.710" style="s2">without too much complexity so if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.680" end="00:25:34.180" style="s2">look at any kind of perception so the an</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.710" end="00:25:37.000" style="s2">effective energy is gonna come up and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.180" end="00:25:40.330" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to drive perception this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.000" end="00:25:44.860" style="s2">allocentric mode if you look at any kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.330" end="00:25:50.530" style="s2">of perception you see something very</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.860" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">interesting and that is there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.530" end="00:25:58.510" style="s2">subject object shift in the narrow</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">phenomenology a perception when you look</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.510" end="00:26:09.160" style="s2">really closely so for example I make it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:13.030" style="s2">very easy if I&#39;m making a soup and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.160" end="00:26:15.190" style="s2">putting in different spices and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.030" end="00:26:18.430" style="s2">I&#39;m just smelling it you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.190" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">smelling it so I&#39;m smelling something</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.430" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">that&#39;s qualia right that&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">experience but if I look looking looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.970" end="00:26:29.110" style="s2">look at what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:32.680" style="s2">pretty soon I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.110" end="00:26:36.160" style="s2">molecular structure of cinnamon or</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.680" end="00:26:41.560" style="s2">coriander and that sounds like the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.160" end="00:26:44.500" style="s2">that sounds like object right so when we</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.560" end="00:26:50.490" style="s2">investigate this way that language makes</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.500" end="00:26:54.780" style="s2">it to hardest cut we realize that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.490" end="00:27:00.610" style="s2">subjective perception bleeds into world</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.780" end="00:27:04.420" style="s2">seamlessly now in between what we call</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.610" end="00:27:08.550" style="s2">qualia of subjective content phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.420" end="00:27:13.530" style="s2">and world where it gets very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.550" end="00:27:18.900" style="s2">which is which I call the halo zoic sown</p>

<p begin="00:28:13.210" end="00:28:17.560" style="s2">I could give you the formula that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:20.620" style="s2">like a part piece of the world it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.310" end="00:28:46.930" style="s2">back again right this is why Goethe said</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.770" end="00:29:01.780" style="s2">perception talks about this really well</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.190" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of complicated</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.780" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">but so the highlight so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">saying is that every organ or perception</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:18.010" style="s2">that is not contained you get beyond</p>

<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:36.730" style="s2">very clear it&#39;s a kind of Satori where</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.550" end="00:29:38.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t tell if the world is like for</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.110" end="00:29:51.090" style="s2">perception in the world are separate</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.610" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">you can experience the molecules gifting</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:04.020" style="s2">you that the way they taste versus I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:05.880" style="s2">tasting the soup I mean there becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.020" end="00:30:09.130" style="s2">agency becomes omnidirectional</p>

<p begin="00:30:18.580" end="00:30:30.830" style="s2">so there is an aspect there&#39;s there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.360" end="00:30:34.670" style="s2">aspect of Tantra where you can drive</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:45.980" style="s2">lust to the same place instead of into</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.270" end="00:31:04.280" style="s2">make it sound too much like a Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.220" end="00:31:07.160" style="s2">ideal the creative force you see that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.280" end="00:31:10.250" style="s2">that&#39;s in the world it&#39;s not it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.160" end="00:31:14.740" style="s2">you and then you know you can resurrect</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.250" end="00:31:14.740" style="s2">your your relationship to it</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.909" end="00:31:49.049" style="s2">are there any where where it does what</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.190" end="00:31:52.890" style="s2">do we are there any questions I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.049" end="00:31:55.980" style="s2">they could be you know they could be</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.890" end="00:31:57.510" style="s2">specific questions maybe had a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.980" end="00:32:05.520" style="s2">good question maybe you want to go off</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.510" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">and you maybe ask it - Bonita you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.520" end="00:32:11.460" style="s2">mute still you&#39;re rapping you know I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:14.429" style="s2">feel like you might have addressed it a</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.460" end="00:32:16.500" style="s2">lot already with this falselist but</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.429" end="00:32:20.789" style="s2">maybe you could go a little bit into</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.500" end="00:32:23.610" style="s2">more how the commodification of sex and</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.789" end="00:32:27.929" style="s2">like the mediation of sex through all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.610" end="00:32:30.059" style="s2">these kind of consumer contexts</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.929" end="00:32:32.909" style="s2">maybe increases the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.059" end="00:32:36.690" style="s2">fetishization that we have and steers us</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.909" end="00:32:41.220" style="s2">away from contract practice yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.690" end="00:32:43.260" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about another simple set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.220" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">words we can use and then I&#39;ll ask you</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.260" end="00:32:52.770" style="s2">questions in doing this work the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:58.230" style="s2">question is what&#39;s online and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.770" end="00:33:01.950" style="s2">offline so if you imagine the situation</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.230" end="00:33:06.950" style="s2">you&#39;re describing a fetish of a fetish</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.950" end="00:33:09.659" style="s2">for something when someone&#39;s having that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.950" end="00:33:12.409" style="s2">experience what&#39;s online is there a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.659" end="00:33:12.409" style="s2">story online</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.610" end="00:33:22.860" style="s2">is there a cultural structure online is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.049" end="00:33:25.730" style="s2">there early attachment psychological</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.860" end="00:33:28.289" style="s2">structures online so these are all</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.730" end="00:33:29.070" style="s2">egocentric forms these are all curving</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.289" end="00:33:33.500" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.070" end="00:33:43.530" style="s2">the mind before it goes into action</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.500" end="00:33:45.900" style="s2">right so now it&#39;s that&#39;s so and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.530" end="00:33:48.510" style="s2">it&#39;s what&#39;s online what&#39;s offline what</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.900" end="00:33:50.760" style="s2">sequence maybe we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.510" end="00:33:55.970" style="s2">States next time I have a really cool</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.760" end="00:33:58.200" style="s2">way to figure out the different state</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.970" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">experiences across all the traditions</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.200" end="00:34:02.550" style="s2">but so what&#39;s online and what&#39;s offline</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:04.770" style="s2">is very important right so is your sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.550" end="00:34:06.990" style="s2">of self online offline is there a</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.770" end="00:34:12.060" style="s2">thought a story or narrative subtly in</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.990" end="00:34:14.160" style="s2">there but also the sequence so if I you</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.060" end="00:34:17.580" style="s2">know you know if I see someone with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.160" end="00:34:21.510" style="s2">cigar and it makes me think of a phallus</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.580" end="00:34:24.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear which came first it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.510" end="00:34:27.510" style="s2">clear that like first I&#39;m like the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.510" end="00:34:30.179" style="s2">like sexy and then I project that onto</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.510" end="00:34:33.570" style="s2">the cigar so the order in which these</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.179" end="00:34:39.960" style="s2">micro kind of cycles come is also</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.570" end="00:34:43.860" style="s2">important you know for me I know that in</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.960" end="00:34:46.700" style="s2">them in most cases things like sexual</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.860" end="00:34:49.260" style="s2">jokes and these little ways we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.700" end="00:34:53.100" style="s2">usually comes from that their bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.260" end="00:34:54.600" style="s2">already excited and then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.100" end="00:34:59.700" style="s2">just don&#39;t see those things they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.600" end="00:35:02.670" style="s2">provoke you in the same way yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.700" end="00:35:08.570" style="s2">usually you know the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.670" end="00:35:13.560" style="s2">direction when you see that that famous</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.570" end="00:35:16.200" style="s2">sequence with Groucho Marx the housewife</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.560" end="00:35:19.050" style="s2">she comes up and he&#39;s like he&#39;s got her</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.200" end="00:35:21.960" style="s2">already you know or who&#39;s great at this</p>

<p begin="00:35:28.140" end="00:35:31.860" style="s2">even want to talk because all she can</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.790" end="00:35:33.900" style="s2">think of her sexual things to say and</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.860" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t want to say them so that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.900" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">order is is upward causation right</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:44.790" style="s2">versus something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:48.150" style="s2">because cultural or thought or some</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.790" end="00:35:50.940" style="s2">experience downwardly causes me to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.150" end="00:35:54.660" style="s2">aroused and there&#39;s no sensorimotor</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.940" end="00:35:57.660" style="s2">action cycle in that that&#39;s I mean these</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.660" end="00:36:01.109" style="s2">still are natural phenomenon for humans</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.660" end="00:36:06.869" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s not this more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.109" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">like natural order of things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.869" end="00:36:11.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a Russell Russell Brand who&#39;s he</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.049" end="00:37:25.319" style="s2">buying this is very illuminating I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.420" end="00:37:28.710" style="s2">very curious about that curve and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.319" end="00:37:31.410" style="s2">nature of the overlap between perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.710" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">systems and sin estate as synesthesia is</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.920" end="00:37:59.849" style="s2">in a very robust way</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.770" end="00:38:05.010" style="s2">in there and the interior so I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.849" end="00:38:06.900" style="s2">it&#39;s that nature of the of your what you</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.220" end="00:38:22.890" style="s2">the story actually because it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.500" end="00:38:24.930" style="s2">metaphor and story that I can translate</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.890" end="00:38:27.180" style="s2">adequately to other people what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.930" end="00:38:30.450" style="s2">on for instance when I was in college we</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.330" end="00:39:02.760" style="s2">code analysis we&#39;re trying to get two</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.849" end="00:39:05.369" style="s2">simple powerful protocols and not</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.760" end="00:39:08.220" style="s2">complex story so the story scene is</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.369" end="00:39:10.109" style="s2">really complex but you should read this</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.220" end="00:39:17.010" style="s2">book by Harry hunt called the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.109" end="00:39:18.990" style="s2">consciousness okay I have value in terms</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.990" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">synesthesia so yeah if your comment</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.040" end="00:39:31.170" style="s2">could be what is the core protocols in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:33.900" style="s2">the story why do I when the teacher</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.170" end="00:39:38.849" style="s2">asked does anyone identify with Phaedra</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.900" end="00:39:42.180" style="s2">and her lust for her I did I did wrongly</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.849" end="00:39:44.339" style="s2">identified with tiara even though as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.180" end="00:39:46.410" style="s2">gay man I lusted for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.339" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">that I could not have so I identified</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.410" end="00:39:52.500" style="s2">with that at that level but I did not</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2">say yes I do identify with the hour trip</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.500" end="00:39:56.160" style="s2">because of the social setting I was in</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:58.349" style="s2">and nobody Rose their hand</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:02.130" style="s2">nobody identified with the Audrey which</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.349" end="00:40:04.170" style="s2">I found very remarkable and no one could</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.130" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">identify with this character the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.170" end="00:40:08.339" style="s2">question I&#39;m having about resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:09.570" style="s2">how can we through art and through the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.339" end="00:40:13.740" style="s2">imagination create</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.570" end="00:40:17.190" style="s2">a kind of resurrection so that these</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.740" end="00:40:21.230" style="s2">kinds of loops do not torment us and do</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.190" end="00:40:27.360" style="s2">not meant us but actually augment or</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.230" end="00:40:30.810" style="s2">elaborate certain kinds of tensions that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.360" end="00:40:33.390" style="s2">we then can modify modulate just as Bach</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.810" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">did in his music so I hope some of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.390" end="00:40:39.750" style="s2">made sense yeah it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.550" end="00:40:44.820" style="s2">question like people always have in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.750" end="00:40:48.390" style="s2">West have always argued that what is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.820" end="00:40:51.260" style="s2">called when you take those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.390" end="00:40:56.820" style="s2">primal energies you turn them into our</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.260" end="00:40:59.630" style="s2">sublimation there&#39;s a movie with Diane</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.820" end="00:41:02.820" style="s2">Keaton and Jack Nicholson perfect</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.630" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">popular people have always argued that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.820" end="00:41:06.780" style="s2">sublimation without sublimation you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:11.700" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have the great arts this does</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.780" end="00:41:15.390" style="s2">not ring true for like indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.700" end="00:41:18.600" style="s2">you know for them it&#39;s like there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.390" end="00:41:20.340" style="s2">much messiness in it but this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.600" end="00:41:22.440" style="s2">place to argue that but that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.340" end="00:41:25.080" style="s2">would say that question lives and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.440" end="00:41:28.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a fantastic question any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.080" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">in most way this maps on to experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.350" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">of child sexual abuse</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.310" end="00:41:44.260" style="s2">so what we&#39;re trying to talk about is</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.020" end="00:41:47.230" style="s2">the sensorimotor action cycle a percent</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.260" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">of these these effects must being the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.230" end="00:41:56.890" style="s2">same one in their flow State they can</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:42:00.490" style="s2">either discharge as action effect</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.890" end="00:42:04.270" style="s2">perception action or you can open the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.490" end="00:42:06.820" style="s2">duration and they they flow you get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.270" end="00:42:09.850" style="s2">sense of flow Shinzon beyond this time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.820" end="00:42:13.060" style="s2">you just feel the energy itself it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.850" end="00:42:16.570" style="s2">suppressed it&#39;s not dissatisfied it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.060" end="00:42:24.760" style="s2">starts to create its own kind of tantric</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.570" end="00:42:27.130" style="s2">cycle if the way understands and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.760" end="00:42:31.990" style="s2">out of my league here but the way I</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.130" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">understand sexual abuse is that again</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.990" end="00:42:40.810" style="s2">most of these traumas are double bind</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">double bind in the sense that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.810" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">something that arises naturally and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.020" end="00:42:53.260" style="s2">you&#39;re put in a double-blind situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.850" end="00:42:56.620" style="s2">so the natural fear of abuse is arising</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.260" end="00:42:57.400" style="s2">with the same need for the parent to</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.620" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">protect you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.400" end="00:43:02.170" style="s2">let&#39;s say so you&#39;re in a double bind in</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:02.860" style="s2">both these both these are completely</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.170" end="00:43:06.580" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.860" end="00:43:09.580" style="s2">neither of these experiences in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.580" end="00:43:11.620" style="s2">child are made up so the double binds at</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.580" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">the level of the authentic self you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.620" end="00:43:19.240" style="s2">to choose between something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:22.030" style="s2">authentic in yourself the same with like</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.240" end="00:43:23.970" style="s2">you know it still goes on in parts of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.030" end="00:43:26.020" style="s2">the world but same with young people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.970" end="00:43:31.540" style="s2">especially in my generation were</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.020" end="00:43:36.130" style="s2">homosexuals the homosexual the object of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.540" end="00:43:38.620" style="s2">desire arises naturally right and yet</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.130" end="00:43:41.020" style="s2">the culture is saying no so this builds</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.620" end="00:43:44.950" style="s2">shamed the difference between shame and</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.020" end="00:43:47.740" style="s2">guilt is shame is the cultural when</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.950" end="00:43:52.810" style="s2">something that is authentic in you</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.740" end="00:43:54.910" style="s2">is rejected whereas guilt is you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.810" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">know you broke the rules and you&#39;ll you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.910" end="00:44:02.650" style="s2">can take the hit for it right so shame</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:06.420" style="s2">that&#39;s why shames hard to work with</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.650" end="00:44:08.680" style="s2">because its nature you you&#39;re asked to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.420" end="00:44:10.540" style="s2">be skeptical about something that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.680" end="00:44:11.980" style="s2">authentically arises that might be part</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.540" end="00:44:16.060" style="s2">of what you were saying John you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.980" end="00:44:17.980" style="s2">like the silence might have said now how</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.060" end="00:44:22.980" style="s2">could you how could you identify with</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.980" end="00:44:26.200" style="s2">that now because of this way in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.980" end="00:44:30.760" style="s2">lust seems to tie into all these other</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.200" end="00:44:32.800" style="s2">categories it can couple with rage let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.760" end="00:44:37.450" style="s2">say are a couple withing or couple with</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.800" end="00:44:39.310" style="s2">panic you know whatever energy though</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.450" end="00:44:41.890" style="s2">those strings are highlighted and if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.310" end="00:44:45.100" style="s2">have an energy signature which could</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.890" end="00:44:47.050" style="s2">have been set in early childhood by your</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.100" end="00:44:51.540" style="s2">relationship with your parents might</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.050" end="00:44:51.540" style="s2">have been angry people you might have</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.750" end="00:45:00.369" style="s2">anger might have been coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.500" end="00:45:05.770" style="s2">affection or lost yeah all these things</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.369" end="00:45:09.850" style="s2">start to build complexity I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.770" end="00:45:12.340" style="s2">did I did I help her make that worse the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.850" end="00:45:14.830" style="s2">future is really lost in its analgesic</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.340" end="00:45:18.609" style="s2">function in the face of social loss oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.830" end="00:45:24.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question can do can you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.609" end="00:45:29.790" style="s2">talk around that question ally yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.970" end="00:45:33.820" style="s2">that&#39;s something I wanted to learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.790" end="00:45:41.170" style="s2">research more about from what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.820" end="00:45:44.350" style="s2">reading lust is not mediated by dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.170" end="00:45:47.380" style="s2">da like you said it&#39;s separate from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.350" end="00:45:50.320" style="s2">seeking system but it uses the seeking</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.380" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">system along with other systems in in</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.320" end="00:45:58.180" style="s2">some sense and and these are tensions</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.740" end="00:46:01.959" style="s2">brain molecules and they&#39;re thought they</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.180" end="00:46:09.219" style="s2">have evolved initially for play</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.959" end="00:46:13.139" style="s2">but then they came to later to be used</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.219" end="00:46:17.739" style="s2">for analgesic purposes in face of social</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.139" end="00:46:20.679" style="s2">loss from what I have read and we know</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.739" end="00:46:27.959" style="s2">this because lust follows the panic</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.679" end="00:46:33.929" style="s2">grief effect and and this is compared to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.959" end="00:46:37.899" style="s2">opiate in some ways and some scholars</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.929" end="00:46:41.639" style="s2">hands say lust is dangerous in this</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.899" end="00:46:44.709" style="s2">aspect because it replaces things</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.639" end="00:46:48.909" style="s2">they&#39;re rewarded and replacing things as</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.709" end="00:46:52.419" style="s2">opposed to the reward being in the chase</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.909" end="00:46:54.819" style="s2">so that&#39;s yeah so I just have a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.419" end="00:46:59.669" style="s2">for you but you know Jesus do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.819" end="00:47:04.089" style="s2">like spaced out and or do you mean like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.669" end="00:47:10.089" style="s2">content and just just a relieve pain</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.089" end="00:47:11.559" style="s2">just okay six if you yeah so a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.089" end="00:47:19.319" style="s2">things I think you know this already</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.559" end="00:47:23.739" style="s2">I&#39;ll just laid out the seeking system is</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.319" end="00:47:26.259" style="s2">you don&#39;t get your hit of dopamine when</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.739" end="00:47:30.339" style="s2">you find what you&#39;re seeking for you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.259" end="00:47:33.279" style="s2">it at the height of anticipation the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.339" end="00:47:35.919" style="s2">anticipatory aspect this is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.279" end="00:47:39.699" style="s2">related to this tantric learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.919" end="00:47:42.130" style="s2">become the perfect seeker the duration</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.699" end="00:47:45.069" style="s2">of the seeking is held out without an</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:47.739" style="s2">object you accept the desire and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.069" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">movement toward but you keep the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.739" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">duration open for as long as possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.320" end="00:48:05.780" style="s2">and well I would suspect that opioids</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.560" end="00:48:05.780" style="s2">kill your sex drive do that does it or</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.339" end="00:48:17.499" style="s2">I mean eventually you know some of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.589" end="00:48:22.180" style="s2">things yeah it&#39;s interesting to figure</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.499" end="00:48:26.709" style="s2">out what the yeah I can&#39;t talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.180" end="00:48:36.249" style="s2">neuropharmacology of opioid abuse I</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.709" end="00:48:39.759" style="s2">haven&#39;t experienced it yeah the interest</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.249" end="00:48:41.410" style="s2">an interesting question and of course</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.759" end="00:48:44.769" style="s2">these things have different you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.410" end="00:48:47.229" style="s2">different effects on different people</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.769" end="00:48:51.099" style="s2">what they what they exacerbate what they</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.229" end="00:48:55.839" style="s2">take offline what they amplify what they</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.099" end="00:48:58.269" style="s2">diminish and your system I always</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.839" end="00:48:58.839" style="s2">thought it was interesting when I was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.269" end="00:49:02.170" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.839" end="00:49:03.969" style="s2">younger person how the different</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.170" end="00:49:07.059" style="s2">alcohols could have such different</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.969" end="00:49:09.219" style="s2">effects when it&#39;s just alcohol you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.059" end="00:49:11.319" style="s2">some would make you kind of like lazy</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.219" end="00:49:14.829" style="s2">and chill and some would make me really</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.319" end="00:49:17.469" style="s2">like like I mean I can&#39;t I can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.829" end="00:49:19.269" style="s2">Inc martinis anymore but when I went to</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.469" end="00:49:24.749" style="s2">the city you know we it would just make</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.269" end="00:49:27.519" style="s2">me really like sharp and energized right</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.749" end="00:49:30.099" style="s2">so we so I think it would might might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.519" end="00:49:34.749" style="s2">different across different opioids</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.099" end="00:49:37.390" style="s2">certainly across different people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.749" end="00:49:39.339" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting question I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.390" end="00:49:41.829" style="s2">spacing out on it because I&#39;m so angry</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.339" end="00:49:48.130" style="s2">at the old people who invented opioid</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.829" end="00:49:50.380" style="s2">and how little meaning a culture makes</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.130" end="00:49:56.890" style="s2">around it how little attention it gets</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.380" end="00:50:00.209" style="s2">and who suffers alright yeah kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.890" end="00:50:00.209" style="s2">distracted by that sorry</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.370" end="00:50:14.740" style="s2">let&#39;s see there&#39;s a question here can</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.050" end="00:50:16.840" style="s2">you say more about double bonds yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.740" end="00:50:20.050" style="s2">double bonds is actually very important</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.840" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">it&#39;s again if you&#39;re working you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.050" end="00:50:26.170" style="s2">working with these simple protocols</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:28.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t answer everything but</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.170" end="00:50:35.140" style="s2">he gave you a strong understanding of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.180" end="00:50:39.910" style="s2">lot of things Wilber early on wrote</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.140" end="00:50:43.630" style="s2">about the the commonality of a double</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.910" end="00:50:50.050" style="s2">bind in psychopathologies and double</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.630" end="00:50:54.250" style="s2">bind is there&#39;s many different forms but</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.050" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">it&#39;s when you&#39;re receiving information</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.250" end="00:51:02.380" style="s2">and they&#39;re contradicting each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:04.570" style="s2">it&#39;s more it&#39;s and so you are like the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.380" end="00:51:08.590" style="s2">parent might be saying I love you but</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.570" end="00:51:12.900" style="s2">they&#39;re raping you or after they rape</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.590" end="00:51:19.480" style="s2">you they say something nice and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.900" end="00:51:23.400" style="s2">start to I mean a response to this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.480" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">dissociation you don&#39;t know where to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.400" end="00:51:31.270" style="s2">which there is no real real reality</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:36.190" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to gauge which is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.270" end="00:51:40.950" style="s2">reality and so people dissociate from</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.190" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">their body because the body is actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.950" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2">part of why it&#39;s it&#39;s a double bind</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.540" end="00:51:51.610" style="s2">because the body is online saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:55.560" style="s2">something no no this is real and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.610" end="00:51:55.560" style="s2">the world is saying something else and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.040" end="00:52:02.470" style="s2">yeah there and then there&#39;s millions of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.800" end="00:52:06.430" style="s2">small ways in our society that we set up</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.470" end="00:52:09.010" style="s2">double binds all the time and we mostly</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.430" end="00:52:12.490" style="s2">do it with what&#39;s called performative</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.010" end="00:52:14.830" style="s2">contradiction someone&#39;s body saying the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.490" end="00:52:19.030" style="s2">opposite of what they&#39;re telling you</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.830" end="00:52:22.089" style="s2">we most so people this is why a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.030" end="00:52:24.040" style="s2">times even on Facebook threads but in</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.089" end="00:52:25.960" style="s2">collective insight practice when things</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.040" end="00:52:28.810" style="s2">are getting heated I&#39;ll say don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.960" end="00:52:33.700" style="s2">attention to the words the words are</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.810" end="00:52:35.800" style="s2">just cathartic action like at a certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.700" end="00:52:41.830" style="s2">point just stop paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.800" end="00:52:45.550" style="s2">words get and try to get down to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.830" end="00:52:53.349" style="s2">really happening first by trusting your</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.550" end="00:53:00.220" style="s2">body and that&#39;s one way to avoid double</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.349" end="00:53:02.050" style="s2">binds it&#39;s very frustrating I know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.220" end="00:53:03.910" style="s2">think pray deep is going to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.050" end="00:53:06.280" style="s2">me here when you&#39;re in a social</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.910" end="00:53:08.890" style="s2">situation and it&#39;s so clear to you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.280" end="00:53:11.830" style="s2">someone&#39;s bullshitting and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.890" end="00:53:16.390" style="s2">like yeah and you&#39;re just like what the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.830" end="00:53:18.220" style="s2"> is going on here like it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.390" end="00:53:21.000" style="s2">then you realize what&#39;s online for</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.220" end="00:53:24.670" style="s2">people it&#39;s just communicating</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.000" end="00:53:27.670" style="s2">transactions there&#39;s perceptions and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.670" end="00:53:30.070" style="s2">there I had a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.670" end="00:53:33.940" style="s2">experience once with a member of my</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.070" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">family who&#39;ve gotten into not a gang of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.940" end="00:53:39.820" style="s2">people who were not nice he was like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:43.420" style="s2">grifter a ripoff artist and then they</p>

<p begin="00:53:49.830" end="00:53:55.180" style="s2">isolation didn&#39;t want these people to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.790" end="00:53:57.310" style="s2">know why I lived but this grifter it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.180" end="00:54:00.430" style="s2">like everything you asked him he was</p>

<p begin="00:54:41.020" end="00:54:47.860" style="s2">in our society our society is so like</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.230" end="00:54:50.410" style="s2"> up so if you experience society</p>

<p begin="00:55:03.390" end="00:55:09.730" style="s2">what are some of the ways that double</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.410" end="00:55:12.250" style="s2">binds resolved themselves either no good</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.730" end="00:55:19.780" style="s2">or constructive way or a bad or</p>

<p begin="00:56:42.250" end="00:56:48.520" style="s2">so they lean what do people do when the</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.970" end="00:56:51.160" style="s2">energy is toxic on Facebook that&#39;s where</p>

<p begin="00:56:54.810" end="00:56:59.260" style="s2">you know and then the opposite happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.490" end="00:57:00.849" style="s2">I&#39;ll do coaching sections with two</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.260" end="00:57:02.770" style="s2">people in relationship don&#39;t like each</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.849" end="00:57:04.030" style="s2">other then I have a horse in the barn</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.770" end="00:57:06.099" style="s2">and they&#39;re sitting there just looking</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.030" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">at each other the horse was packed over</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.099" end="00:57:10.060" style="s2">the corner wanting to get out and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:11.619" style="s2">little by little as their hearts melt</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.060" end="00:57:13.720" style="s2">the horse will come in and put himself</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.619" end="00:57:15.369" style="s2">right in the middle of those two people</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.720" end="00:57:16.840" style="s2">sitting there and they&#39;ll say why did</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.369" end="00:57:21.849" style="s2">the horse do that I said because they</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.840" end="00:57:23.290" style="s2">like sweet energy it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.849" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.290" end="00:57:28.630" style="s2">use your complexity of your mind for</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:32.349" style="s2">interesting creative things like John</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.630" end="00:57:35.920" style="s2">said don&#39;t get all like up in</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.349" end="00:57:38.230" style="s2">this drama of psycho lack psychotic and</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.920" end="00:57:38.590" style="s2">sociopathic people who is which is who</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.230" end="00:57:42.430" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.590" end="00:57:45.730" style="s2">and so you know be like a horse</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.430" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">walk towards sweet energy and just walk</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.730" end="00:57:56.730" style="s2">away from toxic that&#39;s 90% of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:58:01.869" style="s2">good question that&#39;s my best answer I</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.730" end="00:58:04.119" style="s2">mean that&#39;s how I live my life yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.869" end="00:58:06.790" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.119" end="00:58:09.160" style="s2">this is part I&#39;m now I&#39;m gonna get even</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.790" end="00:58:11.290" style="s2">more in trouble this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.160" end="00:58:15.220" style="s2">message that the right is trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.290" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">you now they don&#39;t have it worked out</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.220" end="00:58:21.190" style="s2">either but some does a sense of just you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:22.420" style="s2">know not over complexity things it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.190" end="00:58:25.839" style="s2">kind of a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.420" end="00:58:28.030" style="s2">problem you can make a double bind by</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.839" end="00:58:32.770" style="s2">trying in your own self by trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.030" end="00:58:35.290" style="s2">a double bind right now a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.770" end="00:58:37.060" style="s2">you then you say well why can&#39;t I walk</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.290" end="00:58:39.760" style="s2">away from it and then you&#39;ll find that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.060" end="00:58:42.940" style="s2">you probably have an inward curve and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.760" end="00:58:45.070" style="s2">story and a narrative maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.940" end="00:58:47.830" style="s2">psychological unresolved psychological</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.070" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">material or something but so it&#39;s easier</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.830" end="00:58:55.150" style="s2">said than done but once you get the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:55.990" style="s2">habit of it yeah you don&#39;t want to walk</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.150" end="00:58:57.340" style="s2">away until</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.990" end="00:58:58.840" style="s2">it&#39;s time to walk away but if it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.340" end="00:59:04.180" style="s2">to walk away you just walk away from</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.840" end="00:59:06.070" style="s2">there and yeah are there any therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.180" end="00:59:07.600" style="s2">techniques that you can better</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.070" end="00:59:09.580" style="s2">understand like ah that&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.600" end="00:59:13.240" style="s2">based on this like you kind of walk away</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.580" end="00:59:14.140" style="s2">or ignore it you know so we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.240" end="00:59:16.090" style="s2">is experiment</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.140" end="00:59:21.070" style="s2">there&#39;s no one&#39;s gonna tell you be able</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.090" end="00:59:25.980" style="s2">to help you move in this direction so</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.070" end="00:59:30.460" style="s2">you experiment in ways that feel risky</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.980" end="00:59:32.980" style="s2">but you know are safe like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.460" end="00:59:35.500" style="s2">interesting because I&#39;m June first I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.980" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">going to leave Facebook deactivate my</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.500" end="00:59:43.510" style="s2">house and I can feel this is risky or it</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:46.330" style="s2">does is distasteful to me you know so</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.510" end="00:59:50.560" style="s2">it&#39;s an experiment I mean I know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.330" end="00:59:53.230" style="s2">the way my mind like so today Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.560" end="00:59:55.600" style="s2">Mountain burger invites me on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.230" end="00:59:57.940" style="s2">to a secret group and I&#39;m like oh man</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.600" end="01:00:02.170" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have Facebook like I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.940" end="01:00:05.980" style="s2">all these like you know but I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.170" end="01:00:09.640" style="s2">walk away because I don&#39;t I can&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.980" end="01:00:12.010" style="s2">the question until I try and I know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.640" end="01:00:13.630" style="s2">the risk I feel is actually kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.010" end="01:00:19.270" style="s2">silly I mean from my intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.630" end="01:00:21.820" style="s2">standpoint so you look for things like</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.270" end="01:00:23.980" style="s2">that you know you look for opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.820" end="01:00:25.660" style="s2">if you got a job and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.980" end="01:00:30.850" style="s2">kind of feeling like leaving anyways</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.660" end="01:00:33.070" style="s2">instead of leaving you could push push</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.850" end="01:00:36.369" style="s2">it close to the needle to where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.070" end="01:00:38.410" style="s2">gonna get fired and then maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.369" end="01:00:43.030" style="s2">walk away or you just walk away you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.410" end="01:00:48.910" style="s2">these these things are better resolved</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.030" end="01:00:52.090" style="s2">by trying little experiments interrupt</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.910" end="01:00:54.570" style="s2">your normal habit of responding over</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.090" end="01:00:54.570" style="s2">engaging</p>
