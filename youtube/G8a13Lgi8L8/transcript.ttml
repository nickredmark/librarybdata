<p begin="00:01:47.090" end="00:01:50.929" style="s2">super chat questions which have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.860" end="00:01:52.520" style="s2">collected for us in a spreadsheet which</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.929" end="00:01:54.619" style="s2">you can&#39;t see but we can there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.520" end="00:01:56.090" style="s2">good questions in here I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.619" end="00:01:57.259" style="s2">there shall we get right to it let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.090" end="00:01:58.430" style="s2">it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.259" end="00:01:59.659" style="s2">you want me to read them yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.430" end="00:02:02.119" style="s2">would alright can you talk a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.659" end="00:02:04.130" style="s2">viral load please it is know that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.119" end="00:02:05.720" style="s2">amount viral load is important of IRA</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:07.759" style="s2">load is important in case of measles</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.720" end="00:02:10.130" style="s2">chicken pox polio could it also be the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.759" end="00:02:12.860" style="s2">case with co19 thanks you know we talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.130" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">about this a bit in our last or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.860" end="00:02:17.239" style="s2">maybe the third live stream not sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:20.690" style="s2">which one but we specifically talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.239" end="00:02:25.250" style="s2">about its seeming quite possible that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.690" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">viral load does in fact repetition of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.250" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">exposure increases the chance of getting</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:33.500" style="s2">infected and dent viral load increases</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:36.350" style="s2">the chance of becoming very very sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.500" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">there are some you know possible caveats</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.350" end="00:02:41.239" style="s2">which is for instance that health</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:43.220" style="s2">workers have other extenuating factors</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.239" end="00:02:47.150" style="s2">like tending to be overworked stressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.220" end="00:02:48.650" style="s2">sleep-deprived cetera sure wearing blue</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.150" end="00:02:51.459" style="s2">which is that&#39;ll be the topic of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.650" end="00:02:57.380" style="s2">next live stream yeah wearing blue can</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.459" end="00:02:58.730" style="s2">create create issues yeah so I think was</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.380" end="00:03:00.770" style="s2">livestream three we talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.730" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">yeah so I think we effectively know</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.770" end="00:03:06.380" style="s2">that viral load is playing an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:08.660" style="s2">role the real question is why you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.380" end="00:03:10.520" style="s2">what part of the system is being</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.660" end="00:03:12.860" style="s2">overwhelmed such that somebody who&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.520" end="00:03:16.570" style="s2">a low exposure might have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.860" end="00:03:18.350" style="s2">mild disease or an asymptomatic one and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.570" end="00:03:19.910" style="s2">anyway that there&#39;s a mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.350" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">question to be answered there which will</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.910" end="00:03:27.020" style="s2">tell us a lot once we know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:28.820" style="s2">anyway yeah so stay tuned good sayo</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.020" end="00:03:31.160" style="s2">virus circulating inside a species is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.820" end="00:03:33.080" style="s2">lethal to some rivals or predators would</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.160" end="00:03:36.230" style="s2">rivals turn away from a shared habitat</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.080" end="00:03:39.800" style="s2">and predator from prey so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.230" end="00:03:41.420" style="s2">is a restatement of a question that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.800" end="00:03:43.070" style="s2">asked last time that you and we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.420" end="00:03:44.180" style="s2">quite fire student parse and I spent a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.070" end="00:03:45.800" style="s2">lot of time thinking about what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.180" end="00:03:47.870" style="s2">question might have meant and I realized</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.800" end="00:03:50.750" style="s2">not only did I understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.870" end="00:03:53.600" style="s2">question was but that I had once a long</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.750" end="00:03:57.410" style="s2">time ago asked Bob Trivers our</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.600" end="00:03:59.780" style="s2">undergraduate advisor the very same</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.410" end="00:04:00.950" style="s2">question really yes I had asked him the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.780" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">very same question so the question</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.950" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">basically was could you be infected with</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:06.830" style="s2">something that would work to your</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">benefit by dissuading things that might</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.830" end="00:04:11.990" style="s2">eat you from wanting to so my example</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">years ago was pigs and trichinosis could</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.990" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">the trichinosis be preventative and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:20.630" style="s2">Bob&#39;s response was that he&#39;d love to see</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:23.300" style="s2">an analysis whereby it could work but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.630" end="00:04:25.670" style="s2">that it almost certainly wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.300" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">for reasons of group selection which I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.670" end="00:04:29.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand his answer at the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:33.020" style="s2">because that was a new concept to me but</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.260" end="00:04:35.030" style="s2">he made an argument in which he snow</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.020" end="00:04:36.740" style="s2">because arguing effectively he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.030" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">arguing that the mechanism that I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.740" end="00:04:41.420" style="s2">asking about would comet and clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:43.669" style="s2">selection so without getting into that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.420" end="00:04:47.240" style="s2">madness right now let us just say that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.669" end="00:04:50.480" style="s2">the problem for a mechanism like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.240" end="00:04:52.610" style="s2">where a creature takes on a virus that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.480" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">maybe it tolerates well but its</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.610" end="00:04:58.130" style="s2">predators won&#39;t and thereby its</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">predators decide not to eat it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.130" end="00:05:02.360" style="s2">problem with that is that the best deal</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">of all goes to the creature who gets the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.360" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">benefit of predators not eating that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:09.410" style="s2">type of animal but doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">virus so there&#39;s a question about how</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.410" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">you would provide an honest</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">advertisement that you actually had the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.760" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.620" end="00:05:17.889" style="s2">illness that the predator didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:20.620" style="s2">mess with of pathogenic mullerian</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.889" end="00:05:23.380" style="s2">mimicry yeah so anyway I think it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.620" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work but it&#39;s not to say it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.380" end="00:05:27.669" style="s2">there&#39;s not some system in which some</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:29.620" style="s2">analog of this could work for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.669" end="00:05:31.990" style="s2">that we would have to dispel out it</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.620" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">would run counter to Hamilton&#39;s ook</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.990" end="00:05:37.300" style="s2">style analysis as well in which females</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.310" style="s2">are imagined the hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.300" end="00:05:42.280" style="s2">females are looking for potential mates</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.310" end="00:05:45.160" style="s2">for for males as potential mates who</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.280" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">have low pathogen load and who have some</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.160" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">external indicators some phenotypic</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:50.110" style="s2">indicator of that low pathogen load so</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:51.940" style="s2">these would be really competing</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.110" end="00:05:53.770" style="s2">hypotheses you wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">find both within the same population</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.770" end="00:05:59.650" style="s2">true although I think implicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:02.169" style="s2">the model would be that whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.650" end="00:06:04.060" style="s2">particular pathogen was had such little</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:06.699" style="s2">negative effect that females would have</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.060" end="00:06:08.260" style="s2">no reason to care about it actually so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.699" end="00:06:09.910" style="s2">anyway I think the answer is no it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.260" end="00:06:12.460" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work but it doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.910" end="00:06:16.300" style="s2">something in the ballpark couldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.460" end="00:06:18.280" style="s2">in some system yeah good you to a god</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.300" end="00:06:19.900" style="s2">sense well thank you but the world is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.280" end="00:06:22.120" style="s2">missing a voice from your esteemed crew</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.900" end="00:06:23.380" style="s2">Jordan Peterson his sparse tweets of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.120" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">late don&#39;t sound like his voice and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.380" end="00:06:27.910" style="s2">people are dubious about their</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:33.580" style="s2">authenticity in his physical health yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.910" end="00:06:36.970" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s doing much better and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.580" end="00:06:38.710" style="s2">has been quite sick and he is alive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.970" end="00:06:40.450" style="s2">healing and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.710" end="00:06:41.740" style="s2">our place to say much more than that but</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.450" end="00:06:45.250" style="s2">I think the world will be hearing more</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.740" end="00:06:46.780" style="s2">from him soon yeah I can say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.250" end="00:06:50.260" style="s2">worried about him obviously with what</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.780" end="00:06:53.410" style="s2">he&#39;s been through in the last year he is</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.260" end="00:06:56.380" style="s2">vulnerable here and I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.410" end="00:06:59.949" style="s2">important that he not come in contact</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.380" end="00:07:02.820" style="s2">with Cove at 19 but we do hear that he</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.949" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">is getting better on the mend</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.820" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">in touch with him and if you&#39;re watching</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:13.090" style="s2">Gordon hello we miss you we need your</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:15.340" style="s2">voice and we will be thrilled when</p>

<p begin="00:07:57.480" end="00:08:01.650" style="s2">useful in treatment and my anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.700" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">experience which has prompted me hearing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.650" end="00:08:06.180" style="s2">a bunch of other people&#39;s anecdotal</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:09.000" style="s2">experience of people craving citrus when</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.180" end="00:08:13.500" style="s2">they have been sick is suggestive that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.000" end="00:08:15.960" style="s2">there might be some some mechanism by</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.500" end="00:08:18.390" style="s2">which vitamin C is useful in staving off</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.960" end="00:08:19.650" style="s2">or in healing after infection and again</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.390" end="00:08:22.050" style="s2">like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.650" end="00:08:25.140" style="s2">I had it but it seems quite likely that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.050" end="00:08:27.980" style="s2">I did I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.140" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">hydrocortisone is an anti-inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.980" end="00:08:35.040" style="s2">and we know we think we know that one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:37.110" style="s2">the things going on with extreme cases</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.040" end="00:08:39.540" style="s2">of co19 is inflammation where there</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.110" end="00:08:42.420" style="s2">ought not be inflammation so there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.540" end="00:08:45.060" style="s2">least a simple possible relationship</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.420" end="00:08:47.790" style="s2">there diamond I just don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.060" end="00:08:49.710" style="s2">about firemen to what about the question</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">of sepsis have you heard that most</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.710" end="00:08:53.850" style="s2">people who are dying of kovat 19 die of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:56.610" style="s2">sepsis no that&#39;s the part I&#39;m really yea</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.850" end="00:08:59.310" style="s2">dubious about and I think the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.610" end="00:09:01.980" style="s2">the question is dependent on that claim</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.310" end="00:09:05.400" style="s2">being right so I think it is if there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.980" end="00:09:07.410" style="s2">something to that claim show us what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.400" end="00:09:11.250" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen yet we may have just</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.410" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">overlooked it yeah and you can probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.250" end="00:09:15.270" style="s2">by tweeting something at one or both of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:17.520" style="s2">us it&#39;s the best way to try to show us</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.270" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">that you&#39;ve talked about the limited</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.520" end="00:09:21.060" style="s2">ability of tissues to self repair do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:22.710" style="s2">think there might be a limit to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.060" end="00:09:24.870" style="s2">number of times dendrites in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.710" end="00:09:27.390" style="s2">can self repair after being damaged by</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.870" end="00:09:29.340" style="s2">alcohol so there&#39;s again an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.390" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">in this that dendrites in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.340" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">being damaged by alcohol consumption</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:34.860" style="s2">obviously a lot of things are damaged by</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">alcohol consumption but I had not</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.860" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2">independently heard about</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">Android&#39;s yeah I&#39;ve heard it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.740" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">sure how valid the claim is because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">problem is in dendrites we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:52.200" style="s2">about the the extensions of the cell</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:57.090" style="s2">body of a neuron and these connections</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.200" end="00:09:58.830" style="s2">are basically the circuit the map of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.090" end="00:10:00.600" style="s2">way neurons are connected to each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.830" end="00:10:02.840" style="s2">so each neuron in the brain and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:05.130" style="s2">point of the circuits that then and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.840" end="00:10:08.340" style="s2">termina that synapse antenna news yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.130" end="00:10:11.580" style="s2">so you have a cell body with dendrites</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.340" end="00:10:13.980" style="s2">taking inputs and then you have an axon</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.580" end="00:10:16.920" style="s2">which extends off the cell body and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.980" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">it leads to these these termina which</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.920" end="00:10:20.520" style="s2">then interface with I thought it was the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:22.170" style="s2">other way around I thought dendrites</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.520" end="00:10:24.120" style="s2">were at the endpoint but no matter the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.170" end="00:10:26.400" style="s2">dendrites are on the on the cell body</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.120" end="00:10:30.450" style="s2">and but anyway the point is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.400" end="00:10:31.800" style="s2">interactions between the the dendrites</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:34.260" style="s2">and the other cells to which they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.800" end="00:10:37.380" style="s2">connected are effectively a data</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.260" end="00:10:39.180" style="s2">processing mechanism and so the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.380" end="00:10:42.030" style="s2">a dendrite isn&#39;t inherently good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:45.320" style="s2">because the loss of a dendrite has to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.030" end="00:10:50.070" style="s2">with changing the interface between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.320" end="00:10:52.530" style="s2">the neuron and other neurons and so in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.070" end="00:10:54.690" style="s2">other words dendrites being lost is part</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.530" end="00:10:57.150" style="s2">of how the brain gets wiser and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.690" end="00:10:59.339" style="s2">effective other dendrites being lost</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.150" end="00:11:00.690" style="s2">would be a loss of function but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.339" end="00:11:03.630" style="s2">can&#39;t say one way or the other whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.690" end="00:11:06.030" style="s2">it&#39;s inherently it&#39;s not inherently good</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.630" end="00:11:08.430" style="s2">or bad so so let me just say this</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.030" end="00:11:10.110" style="s2">reminds me of you know there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.430" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">of kinds of programmed cell death and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.110" end="00:11:14.190" style="s2">see a dendrite is a part of a cell but</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">in early development and humans for</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.190" end="00:11:17.790" style="s2">instance you know we have hands that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:21.900" style="s2">highly webbed and then you get this</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.790" end="00:11:23.520" style="s2">apoptosis yeah in which we lose our</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.900" end="00:11:25.740" style="s2">webbing and this is not you know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.520" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">loss of tissue could be viewed by</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.740" end="00:11:28.530" style="s2">someone who doesn&#39;t know what the hand</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:30.600" style="s2">is ultimately going to look like as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.530" end="00:11:33.210" style="s2">problem but it&#39;s actually quite quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.600" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">the intention you know quite quite the</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.210" end="00:11:39.180" style="s2">goal so loss of tissue is not inherently</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.850" style="s2">yeah failure it&#39;s necessary in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.180" end="00:11:44.520" style="s2">cases but in this case a you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.850" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">the reason for dendrites to have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.520" end="00:11:48.420" style="s2">same limitation on the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:50.430" style="s2">replication they can do</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.420" end="00:11:52.589" style="s2">because there&#39;s no danger of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.430" end="00:11:55.320" style="s2">there&#39;s no dendritic cancer where</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.589" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">dendrites proliferate so much that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.320" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">can&#39;t think or function so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:04.500" style="s2">limit that&#39;s necessary on dendritic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.000" end="00:12:07.529" style="s2">growth also the simple fact of their</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.500" end="00:12:09.930" style="s2">being present or absent isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.529" end="00:12:11.430" style="s2">inherently good and so anyway I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.930" end="00:12:13.550" style="s2">the answer to the question is no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.430" end="00:12:17.959" style="s2">no reason to expect an analog in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.550" end="00:12:20.670" style="s2">neuronal tissue of the limitations on</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.959" end="00:12:25.970" style="s2">cellular replacement that occurs in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.670" end="00:12:28.110" style="s2">rest of the body and indeed the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">programming of the brain is really about</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.110" end="00:12:32.459" style="s2">how the neurons are wired primarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">rather you know which cells connect to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.459" end="00:12:38.459" style="s2">what rather than the growth of new</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:40.110" style="s2">neuronal tissue okay is it possible the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.459" end="00:12:42.269" style="s2">ratios from studies using long tail</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.110" end="00:12:43.829" style="s2">array mice might still hold some</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.269" end="00:12:47.070" style="s2">validity since the controls are also</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.829" end="00:12:51.329" style="s2">long telomeric mice somebody is paying</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.070" end="00:12:54.360" style="s2">attention the answer is yes in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.329" end="00:12:55.890" style="s2">circumstances it depends really what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.360" end="00:12:59.100" style="s2">being tested there&#39;s no question that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.890" end="00:13:01.910" style="s2">there are many purposes for which a long</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.100" end="00:13:04.680" style="s2">telomere Mouse may be a perfectly valid</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.910" end="00:13:06.420" style="s2">study organism and then there are other</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.680" end="00:13:07.829" style="s2">purposes for which it&#39;s an absurd study</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.420" end="00:13:09.480" style="s2">organism and you have to be and there</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.829" end="00:13:11.310" style="s2">are purposes for which we do not know</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.480" end="00:13:15.240" style="s2">there are many purposes for which we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.310" end="00:13:17.610" style="s2">not know and so anyway yeah sure they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.240" end="00:13:20.519" style="s2">gonna be cases in which the fact of both</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.610" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">groups having long telomeres negates the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.519" end="00:13:23.880" style="s2">negative impact and there going to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:28.130" style="s2">other cases where it accentuates</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.880" end="00:13:32.519" style="s2">something and renders a paradoxical</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.130" end="00:13:34.110" style="s2">result but we can&#39;t know how any of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.519" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">functions until we figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.110" end="00:13:39.810" style="s2">state of the mice is when it changed if</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.600" end="00:13:42.269" style="s2">it changed by what means it changed and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.810" end="00:13:44.190" style="s2">we as far as we can tell that work isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.269" end="00:13:47.010" style="s2">being done or at least it&#39;s not being</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.190" end="00:13:49.470" style="s2">acknowledged so we have a huge problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.010" end="00:13:52.350" style="s2">but no it won&#39;t be across all studies oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.470" end="00:13:55.050" style="s2">the other thing I wanted to say is we</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.350" end="00:13:57.959" style="s2">saw earlier in the livestream that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.050" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">preceded this question-and-answer we</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.959" end="00:14:01.420" style="s2">were talking a little bit about the</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.770" end="00:14:45.340" style="s2">question here about what the proper</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.340" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">entirely contingent on which question</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:57.820" style="s2">you&#39;re asking okay could humanity&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:08.020" end="00:15:15.130" style="s2">hypothesis this this question I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.520" end="00:15:17.800" style="s2">does not hinge on this but it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.130" end="00:15:22.530" style="s2">something from twelve thirty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.800" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">years ago that is thought to have been a</p>

<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:29.650" style="s2">dispersed already before it impacted</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.120" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">then there are many many sites around</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.650" end="00:15:35.070" style="s2">the earth that impact and may have</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:37.090" style="s2">caused a long winter climate change</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.070" end="00:15:40.420" style="s2">possibly the end of the Clovis culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.090" end="00:15:42.420" style="s2">and a number of possible effects both</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.250" end="00:15:53.380" style="s2">would have opened up lots of niche for</p>

<p begin="00:15:57.820" end="00:16:04.810" style="s2">think this question is asking about our</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.350" end="00:16:08.110" style="s2">technological acceleration right now I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.810" end="00:16:10.060" style="s2">think and you know this this moment</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.110" end="00:16:12.070" style="s2">potentially Tsarskoe of to being red is</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.060" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">a near extinction event or maybe the</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.260" end="00:16:19.100" style="s2">evolution perhaps well let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:21.890" style="s2">there are a lot of ways that this can</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.100" end="00:16:24.470" style="s2">work it&#39;s very hard to take a system</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.890" end="00:16:27.110" style="s2">that seems to be functioning and to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.470" end="00:16:29.600" style="s2">argue for a radical shift which is where</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.110" end="00:16:31.490" style="s2">we find ourselves at the present we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:33.830" style="s2">to shift the way our system functions</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.490" end="00:16:35.510" style="s2">because our system literally cannot</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.830" end="00:16:38.210" style="s2">continue on this way there&#39;s just simply</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.510" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">not enough of the resources that we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.210" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">exhausting for us to keep doing this so</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:44.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got cornucopia pnes who think</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:46.460" style="s2">we&#39;ll come up with something and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.030" end="00:16:48.350" style="s2">you&#39;ve got people who know that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.460" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">process isn&#39;t reliable who are saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.350" end="00:16:52.370" style="s2">well it doesn&#39;t matter that things are</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.710" style="s2">going reasonably well we have to change</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.370" end="00:16:56.750" style="s2">the way we live and the sooner we do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.710" end="00:16:57.350" style="s2">the better very hard to make that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.750" end="00:16:59.540" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.350" end="00:17:02.540" style="s2">you know this we&#39;re running up against</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.540" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">the problem of people like Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.540" end="00:17:07.610" style="s2">pointing out that it&#39;s never been better</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:08.690" style="s2">here and the truth is in many ways it</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.610" end="00:17:10.010" style="s2">has never been better</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.690" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.010" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">and so if it&#39;s not sustainable the last</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.290" end="00:17:14.780" style="s2">two matters</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:16.760" style="s2">sorry until the last two months most</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.780" end="00:17:18.589" style="s2">people in weird countries had never</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.760" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">imagined what it might be like to go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.589" end="00:17:23.380" style="s2">a store and have empty shelves yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.230" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">anyway this is a long way of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.380" end="00:17:28.940" style="s2">among the many mechanisms through which</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:31.820" style="s2">a catastrophe of one kind or another can</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.940" end="00:17:34.520" style="s2">promote change that&#39;s positive is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.820" end="00:17:36.470" style="s2">it opens people&#39;s eyes so if people can</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.520" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">now understand that the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.470" end="00:17:41.240" style="s2">are living in is hyper fragile and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">that means you can&#39;t just look at how</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.240" end="00:17:45.560" style="s2">easy things are on your average day and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.580" end="00:17:48.680" style="s2">in for anything about how long it will</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:51.700" style="s2">go on now we can have a discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.680" end="00:17:54.470" style="s2">how to shore up the system and to</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.700" end="00:17:57.740" style="s2">reasonably change it so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.470" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">continue living as we do for you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.740" end="00:18:01.010" style="s2">two hundred five hundred a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:02.630" style="s2">years into the future that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.010" end="00:18:05.360" style="s2">discussion that&#39;s much more possible in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.630" end="00:18:07.970" style="s2">light of kovat 19 and frankly as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.360" end="00:18:09.170" style="s2">said before this could have been we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.970" end="00:18:12.590" style="s2">not out of the woods but this could have</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.170" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">been much much worse right and so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.590" end="00:18:17.990" style="s2">there is as horrifying as this is there</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:19.790" style="s2">is a positive aspect which is that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.990" end="00:18:21.290" style="s2">are all now awake to the fragility of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.790" end="00:18:22.850" style="s2">the system in a way we just simply</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.290" end="00:18:27.800" style="s2">weren&#39;t a couple of months ago that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.850" end="00:18:28.590" style="s2">right the Steel Man podcast since every</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.800" end="00:18:31.049" style="s2">purse</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.590" end="00:18:33.090" style="s2">except thought sensation etc is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.049" end="00:18:35.159" style="s2">experienced in consciousness and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.090" end="00:18:37.740" style="s2">no capacity to go outside consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.159" end="00:18:39.390" style="s2">to validate a physical substrate why</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.740" end="00:18:41.460" style="s2">don&#39;t we talk about the hard problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.390" end="00:18:43.260" style="s2">material why don&#39;t we talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.460" end="00:18:45.059" style="s2">hard problem material I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.260" end="00:18:47.010" style="s2">because if we talked about the hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.059" end="00:18:49.320" style="s2">problem in materialism nobody would want</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.010" end="00:18:51.929" style="s2">to talk to us hey that&#39;s because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.320" end="00:18:53.340" style="s2">social creatures we Intuit that if we go</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.929" end="00:18:55.140" style="s2">down that road we&#39;ll be very lonely</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.340" end="00:18:56.460" style="s2">although to be fair I feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:18:57.510" style="s2">that way about people who want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.460" end="00:19:00.150" style="s2">about the hard problem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.510" end="00:19:01.710" style="s2">I see I feel that way about them as well</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.150" end="00:19:05.399" style="s2">so we&#39;re not really answering the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.710" end="00:19:07.559" style="s2">question but we can see for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.399" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">those organisms who are not sharing</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.559" end="00:19:11.700" style="s2">their conscious thoughts and sensations</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.090" end="00:19:13.950" style="s2">with us but are manifesting in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.700" end="00:19:16.169" style="s2">and doing things are experiencing their</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.950" end="00:19:18.450" style="s2">world materially are engaging the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.169" end="00:19:19.559" style="s2">materially whether or not they have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.450" end="00:19:21.870" style="s2">consciousness and whether or not they</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.559" end="00:19:23.970" style="s2">can share that consciousness with us so</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.870" end="00:19:26.039" style="s2">the hard part so this is I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.970" end="00:19:28.350" style="s2">remember what it&#39;s called this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.039" end="00:19:30.299" style="s2">is gaining some traction in some circles</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.350" end="00:19:34.380" style="s2">that consciousness precedes oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.299" end="00:19:39.750" style="s2">world whatever it&#39;s called it&#39;s Pam yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.380" end="00:19:44.309" style="s2">I think this this feels like I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.750" end="00:19:45.990" style="s2">tell if it&#39;s asked asking in sort of 9</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.309" end="00:19:47.460" style="s2">good faith I think all of the Steelman</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.990" end="00:19:49.980" style="s2">podcast questions are in good faith but</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.460" end="00:19:51.510" style="s2">is it is it a jab at pants psychism or</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.980" end="00:19:53.700" style="s2">is it an attempt to get us to engage it</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.510" end="00:19:55.230" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure I think neither of us take</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.700" end="00:19:58.049" style="s2">it seriously enough to want to engage it</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.230" end="00:20:00.210" style="s2">well I would say I in my experience you</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.049" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">can recognize heterodox thinkers because</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.210" end="00:20:03.659" style="s2">if you come up with something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">called the hard problem in a quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.659" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">that they are interested in they&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:08.130" style="s2">you that&#39;s not a hard problem then</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:09.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll tell you what they think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.130" end="00:20:10.919" style="s2">answer is and they&#39;ll say the real hard</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.480" end="00:20:12.149" style="s2">problem is and then they&#39;ll point to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.919" end="00:20:15.630" style="s2">something else so I think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.149" end="00:20:19.169" style="s2">classic example of that so it&#39;s a move</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.630" end="00:20:20.909" style="s2">I&#39;ve made myself I should say alright do</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.169" end="00:20:22.260" style="s2">I need to wear a mask if I just go for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.909" end="00:20:25.740" style="s2">walk in my neighborhood and don&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.260" end="00:20:30.750" style="s2">within 10 yards of anyone I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.740" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly breathing fresh air</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.750" end="00:20:38.309" style="s2">is very good for you I know that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:40.409" style="s2">know if you are on narrow trails that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.309" end="00:20:41.970" style="s2">are sometimes frequented by runners and</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.409" end="00:20:42.360" style="s2">runners are less likely to be wearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.970" end="00:20:44.490" style="s2">math</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.360" end="00:20:46.140" style="s2">and they are they should they have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.490" end="00:20:48.299" style="s2">higher responsibility to be wearing</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.140" end="00:20:49.649" style="s2">masks and a vulnerability they have both</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.299" end="00:20:51.899" style="s2">a higher vulnerability but they are also</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.649" end="00:20:54.210" style="s2">much more likely to spread what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.899" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">got to other people because they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.210" end="00:20:58.980" style="s2">experiencing greater respiratory</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:21:00.299" style="s2">activity and so if you are if you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.980" end="00:21:02.549" style="s2">likely to be sharing trails with runners</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.299" end="00:21:05.100" style="s2">and not all the runners in your in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.549" end="00:21:07.830" style="s2">area are likely to be masked you might</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.100" end="00:21:09.210" style="s2">need to mask to be careful but I mean on</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.830" end="00:21:11.850" style="s2">the walk that I took with our dog this</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.210" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">morning you know there&#39;s plenty of space</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:16.139" style="s2">to get away from people when you do run</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:18.539" style="s2">into them and neither I nor the dog</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.139" end="00:21:21.809" style="s2">we&#39;re wearing a mask I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.539" end="00:21:23.700" style="s2">say I mean I realize I&#39;m going to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.809" end="00:21:26.130" style="s2">annoying by continuing to raise the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.700" end="00:21:27.889" style="s2">point over and over again but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.130" end="00:21:30.450" style="s2">part of the virtue of this solution</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.889" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">right you put it around your neck you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.450" end="00:21:35.519" style="s2">don&#39;t put it up but if somebody&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">the other way maybe you do or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.519" end="00:21:39.000" style="s2">walking up behind somebody because</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pass them you&#39;re passing</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.000" end="00:21:45.750" style="s2">through a cloud of what they&#39;ve exhaled</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:47.519" style="s2">now that said this is a we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.750" end="00:21:49.470" style="s2">a kind of adult conversation about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.519" end="00:21:52.230" style="s2">I think a lot of people are carrying</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.470" end="00:21:54.269" style="s2">around the model tell me what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.230" end="00:21:56.460" style="s2">will make me perfectly safe and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.269" end="00:21:59.789" style="s2">I&#39;ll do it that&#39;s not what you should be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.460" end="00:22:02.820" style="s2">thinking the fact is you know you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.789" end="00:22:04.799" style="s2">wear a diving bell that would be safe</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:07.799" style="s2">right but you&#39;re not going to wear a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:10.860" style="s2">diving though frankly all of us could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.799" end="00:22:15.299" style="s2">wearing the kind of respirators that one</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.860" end="00:22:16.830" style="s2">wears when you&#39;re applying paint we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.299" end="00:22:18.809" style="s2">not doing it it would provide greater</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.830" end="00:22:21.000" style="s2">protection but the point is the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.809" end="00:22:23.549" style="s2">wearing such a thing is so high that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.000" end="00:22:26.820" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the right place you&#39;re much</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.549" end="00:22:29.100" style="s2">better off managing the risk at some</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.820" end="00:22:30.840" style="s2">tolerable level and basically my point</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.100" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">about the bandanas is it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.840" end="00:22:34.230" style="s2">tolerable level you can wear it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:36.029" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have it up you can put it</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.230" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">up on the fly</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.029" end="00:22:40.649" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t broadcast a medical message</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:47.659" style="s2">so anyway there&#39;s a lot to be said for</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.649" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">it and if it needs augmentation this</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.659" end="00:22:53.399" style="s2">some of you will know what these are</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.680" style="s2">these are shop towels right shop towels</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.399" end="00:22:58.020" style="s2">there was never a run on these things</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.680" end="00:22:59.460" style="s2">if you take a shop towel and you feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.020" end="00:23:01.350" style="s2">that you&#39;re in a city to buy these when</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.460" end="00:23:05.070" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t buy paper towels yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.350" end="00:23:06.870" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation that&#39;s maybe more</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.070" end="00:23:10.200" style="s2">hazardous than going to the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.870" end="00:23:14.820" style="s2">store you can put a shop towel in here</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.200" end="00:23:17.130" style="s2">fold it right back up and put it right</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.820" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">back on and now you have a much more</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.130" end="00:23:26.340" style="s2">effective barrier so anyway I think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:28.380" style="s2">bottom line message is figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.340" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">the stuff is transmitted you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.380" end="00:23:32.430" style="s2">gonna have a perfect model because none</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:34.710" style="s2">of us do but if you have a decent model</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.430" end="00:23:36.210" style="s2">then you can answer your own question if</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.710" end="00:23:38.190" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go walking when nobody else</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.210" end="00:23:40.380" style="s2">is out you probably don&#39;t need anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.190" end="00:23:41.640" style="s2">but the cost of having a bandanna or</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.380" end="00:23:42.690" style="s2">something else around your neck that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.640" end="00:23:45.510" style="s2">can pull up when you do encounter</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.690" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">somebody I mean a it sends the signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.510" end="00:23:50.250" style="s2">every time I go out people look at me</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:52.620" style="s2">and I look at them and I can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.250" end="00:23:54.780" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of thinking are you being</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.620" end="00:23:57.710" style="s2">irresponsible or are you being careful</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.780" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">and so anyway even just having the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.710" end="00:24:03.090" style="s2">object that tells them I didn&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:05.820" style="s2">lightly all right I&#39;m going out and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.090" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">being deliberate about it is is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.820" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">important and that is a that is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.320" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">physical a visual indicator in the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:14.520" style="s2">that the masks that my mother has made</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">for me that I am now wearing when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.520" end="00:24:19.770" style="s2">out I put them in my pocket before I</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:21.150" style="s2">wear them you know until I run into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.770" end="00:24:23.370" style="s2">situation when they&#39;re still fresh</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.150" end="00:24:25.170" style="s2">before they are have been used and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.370" end="00:24:27.990" style="s2">need of being laundered they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.170" end="00:24:29.040" style="s2">visible which means that if I were to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.990" end="00:24:31.560" style="s2">see anyone you know what I&#39;m driving</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.040" end="00:24:33.540" style="s2">when I&#39;m driving to the store they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.560" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">not visible and it doesn&#39;t do the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.540" end="00:24:40.530" style="s2">job yep it doesn&#39;t but you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:41.970" style="s2">I guess one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.530" end="00:24:43.830" style="s2">seeing is I&#39;m seeing people</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.970" end="00:24:46.940" style="s2">experimenting yep and that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.830" end="00:24:48.960" style="s2">took weeks but people are now showing up</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.940" end="00:24:50.850" style="s2">improvising and they&#39;re discovering what</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.960" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">works and so anyway it&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.850" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">but I would say understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:24:59.190" style="s2">argument is about how this is being</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:25:01.890" style="s2">transmitted and then be rational right</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.190" end="00:25:04.650" style="s2">it&#39;s as you know how the virus infects a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.890" end="00:25:06.510" style="s2">cell that&#39;s a highly technical question</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.650" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">how the virus gets into your lungs</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.510" end="00:25:10.690" style="s2">that&#39;s not a highly technical question</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s the question that you&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.690" end="00:25:15.370" style="s2">with when you when you go out good</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">figures indicate a much lower rate of</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.370" end="00:25:19.389" style="s2">infection and also lower death rate from</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:22.629" style="s2">kovat 19 in countries that still have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.389" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">BCG vaccine program for tuberculosis why</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.629" end="00:25:27.999" style="s2">do you think that is this we saw this</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:31.480" style="s2">briefly in between the two live streams</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.999" end="00:25:33.249" style="s2">and I don&#39;t I did not assess whether or</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.480" end="00:25:37.179" style="s2">not the claim is true that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.249" end="00:25:38.710" style="s2">lower we&#39;ve did lower rates of infection</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.179" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">and lower death rates in countries that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.710" end="00:25:43.119" style="s2">still have this vaccine but this is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:49.119" style="s2">older TB vaccine the one that leaves</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.119" end="00:25:51.700" style="s2">like a circular mark and so here here I</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.119" end="00:25:54.519" style="s2">cheated I looked it up it&#39;s the only one</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.700" end="00:25:58.659" style="s2">that we did this for that we managed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.519" end="00:26:00.399" style="s2">see in between these and without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.659" end="00:26:02.230" style="s2">if this claim is true I will say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.399" end="00:26:04.139" style="s2">there is apparently reported in science</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.230" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">in the last couple of weeks for</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.139" end="00:26:13.179" style="s2">countries that are ramping up to explore</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:16.210" style="s2">whether or not this vaccine which seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.179" end="00:26:19.990" style="s2">to can convey that&#39;s not quite the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.210" end="00:26:22.869" style="s2">word not just specific immunity for TB</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.990" end="00:26:24.700" style="s2">but a wider immunity may actually be</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.869" end="00:26:27.940" style="s2">effective against the novel coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.700" end="00:26:30.340" style="s2">so that that speaks not at all to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.940" end="00:26:33.100" style="s2">mechanism except that there is some kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.340" end="00:26:36.730" style="s2">of more general immunity that this very</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.100" end="00:26:39.639" style="s2">old uh vaccine seems to seems to convey</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.730" end="00:26:42.249" style="s2">and it is actually in it in research</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.639" end="00:26:47.139" style="s2">phase right now so I would add a caveat</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.249" end="00:26:50.019" style="s2">here though which is the fact even if</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.139" end="00:26:54.070" style="s2">the fact is true as stated it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.019" end="00:26:58.840" style="s2">suggest in this case that the TB vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.070" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">is causal of the differential likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.840" end="00:27:04.330" style="s2">of infection it could be in fact it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:07.619" style="s2">sounds plausible enough but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.330" end="00:27:10.090" style="s2">is if this is a holdover vaccine then</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.619" end="00:27:13.029" style="s2">surely the countries that still use it</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.090" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">are united by more than just the simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.029" end="00:27:17.559" style="s2">use of that vaccine they will be</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:19.090" style="s2">probably socioeconomically similar they</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.559" end="00:27:22.110" style="s2">will have similar decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.090" end="00:27:27.030" style="s2">mechanisms and budgets per capita</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.110" end="00:27:30.540" style="s2">for for medicine and all so you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.030" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">heard that correlation does not imply</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.540" end="00:27:35.490" style="s2">causation when people claim that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.840" style="s2">drives me crazy because correlation does</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.490" end="00:27:38.670" style="s2">imply causation when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.840" end="00:27:40.020" style="s2">pre-existing hypothesis that connects</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.670" end="00:27:42.390" style="s2">the two but in the absence of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.020" end="00:27:44.850" style="s2">pre-existing hypothesis correlation does</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.390" end="00:27:48.570" style="s2">not imply causation which means that the</p>

<p begin="00:27:48.570" end="00:27:53.130" style="s2">be correlated with greater immunity to</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.130" end="00:27:57.480" style="s2">observation is now in need of a test and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.890" end="00:27:59.730" style="s2">it&#39;s and the tests are being rolled out</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.480" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">it looks like and I would say that there</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:05.700" style="s2">are other tests which we could figure</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:09.390" style="s2">out very quickly which would be if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.700" end="00:28:11.370" style="s2">do a pairwise comparison of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.390" end="00:28:13.950" style="s2">who don&#39;t live in those countries who</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:15.690" style="s2">did have this vaccine versus didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.950" end="00:28:17.850" style="s2">this vaccine well within those countries</p>

<p begin="00:28:24.900" end="00:28:29.309" style="s2">what are what are the outcomes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.580" end="00:28:30.660" style="s2">true so I and I had assumed everybody</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.309" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">was vaccinated in these countries but</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.660" end="00:28:37.169" style="s2">even if that&#39;s true people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:38.340" style="s2">immigrated in would maybe not have had</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.169" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">them and we could compare those two</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.340" end="00:28:43.590" style="s2">populations but anyway the prediction is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:45.750" style="s2">if the vaccine is causal then it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.590" end="00:28:47.130" style="s2">matter where you are the presence of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.750" end="00:28:49.169" style="s2">vaccine will be protective in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.130" end="00:28:50.460" style="s2">absence of the vaccine will cause you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.169" end="00:28:52.620" style="s2">be vulnerable and we should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.460" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">read that actually very very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.620" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">without running a new experiment just by</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.750" end="00:29:24.780" style="s2">it but what if I&#39;m looking behind you oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.860" end="00:29:27.570" style="s2">then it goes behind both of us whose</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.019" end="00:29:48.590" style="s2">could you outline your approach to game</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.580" end="00:29:49.759" style="s2">be the only elaboration of the concept</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.590" end="00:29:51.519" style="s2">of have been able to find online is</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.519" end="00:29:55.879" style="s2">well I can say this I this isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:58.970" style="s2">right place to try to do an elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.879" end="00:30:02.029" style="s2">thing but game B is the idea that our</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.970" end="00:30:06.950" style="s2">system because it is so fragile requires</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.029" end="00:30:09.019" style="s2">a change what I have called a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.950" end="00:30:13.429" style="s2">revolutionary change without revolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.019" end="00:30:16.820" style="s2">and that that would produce a safe</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.820" end="00:30:24.110" style="s2">is non utopian utopianism being the road</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.110" end="00:30:27.980" style="s2">have to be competitively superior to our</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.980" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">something that could be a poem posed</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.419" end="00:30:33.049" style="s2">from above it would have to be something</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.039" end="00:30:35.570" style="s2">that effectively caught on because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.049" end="00:30:37.940" style="s2">worked for people it wins within the</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.940" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">superior to game a in game A&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.039" end="00:30:48.759" style="s2">beyond that I would say I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.539" end="00:30:52.369" style="s2">anybody including me should be providing</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.759" end="00:30:55.820" style="s2">game B proposals I think the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.369" end="00:30:58.909" style="s2">that game B is an idea it&#39;s a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.820" end="00:31:01.070" style="s2">sort of the minimum requirements of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.909" end="00:31:04.539" style="s2">design and then all of us ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.070" end="00:31:07.399" style="s2">free below that level to propose</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.539" end="00:31:10.340" style="s2">something that might reach those</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.399" end="00:31:14.090" style="s2">objectives I have laid out a basic</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.340" end="00:31:16.490" style="s2">version of this in my 4th frontier talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.090" end="00:31:18.379" style="s2">you can look that one up online it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.490" end="00:31:20.269" style="s2">your website it&#39;s on the website the 4th</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.379" end="00:31:22.549" style="s2">frontier thinking has come a long way</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.269" end="00:31:24.619" style="s2">since then so there&#39;s more to say about</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.549" end="00:31:27.619" style="s2">what a 4th frontier world might look</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.619" end="00:31:28.789" style="s2">like so that&#39;s also the final chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.619" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">our book its fourth frontier</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.789" end="00:31:33.740" style="s2">fourth frontiers final chapter of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:35.690" style="s2">books so stay tuned it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.740" end="00:31:38.119" style="s2">conversation but that&#39;s really what it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.690" end="00:31:40.369" style="s2">is at this point and I&#39;m interested to</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.119" end="00:31:43.350" style="s2">see as many people who understand the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.369" end="00:31:46.020" style="s2">necessity of a game B world and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.350" end="00:31:47.429" style="s2">the kind of game theory that would go</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.020" end="00:31:48.780" style="s2">into architecting such a thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.429" end="00:31:51.480" style="s2">interested in hearing as many of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.780" end="00:31:54.299" style="s2">proposals as possible likely if there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.480" end="00:31:57.210" style="s2">a viable way forward it will involve</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.299" end="00:32:00.960" style="s2">elements from the best proposals and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.210" end="00:32:03.150" style="s2">there will be sort of a chimeric game be</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.960" end="00:32:04.470" style="s2">proposal ultimately that&#39;s what I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.150" end="00:32:05.970" style="s2">to see and there&#39;s not going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.470" end="00:32:07.380" style="s2">blueprint or roadmap</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.970" end="00:32:09.870" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s going to be seeking the</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.380" end="00:32:11.610" style="s2">adaptive Foothill in order to climb a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.870" end="00:32:15.900" style="s2">peak we can navigate there we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.610" end="00:32:18.090" style="s2">spell it out beforehand okay would you</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.900" end="00:32:21.240" style="s2">consider doing a thorough online biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.090" end="00:32:22.919" style="s2">class greetings from Norway that is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.240" end="00:32:25.140" style="s2">only kind of biology class we would</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.919" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">consider thorough thorough yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.140" end="00:32:30.030" style="s2">yeah whereas I read that and thought I</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:32.340" style="s2">much I would do thorough just like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.030" end="00:32:37.650" style="s2">never want to write a general biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.340" end="00:32:40.200" style="s2">textbook but biology through various</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.650" end="00:32:41.190" style="s2">evolutionary lenses yes perhaps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.200" end="00:32:42.900" style="s2">it&#39;s for the class I would say we would</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.190" end="00:32:44.549" style="s2">do a thorough we would be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.900" end="00:32:46.740" style="s2">doing a thorough class probably it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.549" end="00:32:49.110" style="s2">thorough biology class because frankly</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:50.929" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible biography is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.110" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">largest subject by virtue of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.929" end="00:32:56.309" style="s2">unparalleled complexity in biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:58.650" style="s2">relative to every other field so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.309" end="00:33:01.169" style="s2">impossible to be thorough but you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.650" end="00:33:04.620" style="s2">pick a topic and do you know what we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.169" end="00:33:07.799" style="s2">understand so far kind of thing is urine</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.620" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">sterile if you have yes is the short</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.799" end="00:33:11.700" style="s2">answer on that one if you have no means</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:13.940" style="s2">to disinfect the hands would urine work</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.700" end="00:33:18.090" style="s2">in a pinch thanks for the videos be well</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.940" end="00:33:20.220" style="s2">no no so I would I&#39;m gonna go first no</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.090" end="00:33:21.960" style="s2">you&#39;re an is sterile but no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.220" end="00:33:23.520" style="s2">going to disinfect your hands it being</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.960" end="00:33:29.640" style="s2">sterile doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a disinfectant</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.520" end="00:33:32.549" style="s2">it&#39;s soap and alcohol will disable the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.640" end="00:33:34.230" style="s2">virus for different reasons but urine</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.549" end="00:33:36.120" style="s2">being itself sterile just means that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.230" end="00:33:37.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the capacity presumably to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.120" end="00:33:39.240" style="s2">infect you with anything new but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.799" end="00:33:42.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it can disinfect you</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.240" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">so the difference between sterile and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.630" end="00:33:47.429" style="s2">sterilizing yeah that&#39;s right actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:49.950" style="s2">so the reason that I am a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.429" end="00:33:53.880" style="s2">hesitant about saying anything so clear</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.950" end="00:33:54.809" style="s2">is that I believe that the salt at least</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.880" end="00:33:59.210" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.809" end="00:34:03.960" style="s2">urine actually does have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.210" end="00:34:10.980" style="s2">to do some sterilization and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.960" end="00:34:14.700" style="s2">them the Masai who are herders in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.980" end="00:34:17.790" style="s2">East Africa who mostly eat meat and milk</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.700" end="00:34:21.859" style="s2">yeah I mean blood and milk well they eat</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.790" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">they eat meat blood and milk is a famous</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.859" end="00:34:28.440" style="s2">beverage they drink but in any case I am</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:30.119" style="s2">I&#39;m really hoping I didn&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.440" end="00:34:33.089" style="s2">particular culture wrong but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.119" end="00:34:37.319" style="s2">is the Maasai who do utilize the urine</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.089" end="00:34:39.300" style="s2">of their cows to sterilize their hands</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.319" end="00:34:41.339" style="s2">now that doesn&#39;t say that it works</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.300" end="00:34:43.859" style="s2">against any particular virus but my</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.339" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">guess would be so like before before</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.859" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">they&#39;re milking the cows maybe something</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">like that you know if I&#39;m recalling it</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:52.740" style="s2">correctly the cow is peeing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:55.829" style="s2">an opportunity to go sterilize your</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.740" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">hands so I mean it&#39;s in a very dry</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.829" end="00:35:00.930" style="s2">habitat yeah so the water is limiting</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:06.210" style="s2">water is limiting opportunity strikes</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.930" end="00:35:07.800" style="s2">when it does yeah you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.210" end="00:35:10.829" style="s2">no means to disinfect your hands would</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.800" end="00:35:12.420" style="s2">we urine work in a pinch one of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.829" end="00:35:15.150" style="s2">responses is if you&#39;re in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.420" end="00:35:17.460" style="s2">where that is really the issue they</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.150" end="00:35:20.940" style="s2">think it might be better to drink rather</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.460" end="00:35:22.890" style="s2">than use it to clean your hands Wow</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.940" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not going to touch that</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.890" end="00:35:27.540" style="s2">literally or figuratively but I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:32.520" style="s2">say this you have other options with</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.540" end="00:35:35.450" style="s2">respect to sterilizing your hands so for</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.520" end="00:35:39.859" style="s2">example if I was caught really with no</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.450" end="00:35:42.869" style="s2">if I thought I had touched kovat 19a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.859" end="00:35:47.069" style="s2">concentrated as far as the virus star&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.869" end="00:35:49.230" style="s2">Cove - yeah if I thought I had contacted</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.069" end="00:35:52.770" style="s2">it and I didn&#39;t have any water</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.230" end="00:35:55.319" style="s2">I would probably seek you know if there</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.770" end="00:35:58.829" style="s2">was sand that&#39;d be great right</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.319" end="00:36:02.069" style="s2">you can desiccate the virus into</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.829" end="00:36:04.049" style="s2">oblivion you can physically rub it so</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.069" end="00:36:08.020" style="s2">that the particles would stick to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.049" end="00:36:09.780" style="s2">sand and drop away dirt</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.020" end="00:36:13.240" style="s2">be used to work there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.780" end="00:36:16.980" style="s2">richness in dirt that could be used to</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.240" end="00:36:20.380" style="s2">bind things now it does have a lipid</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.980" end="00:36:23.980" style="s2">surface layer the virus not dirt so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.380" end="00:36:25.570" style="s2">lipid is nonpolar which means it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.980" end="00:36:28.060" style="s2">going to be as effective at sticking to</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.570" end="00:36:29.530" style="s2">a lot of the organic materials in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.060" end="00:36:32.620" style="s2">soil but nonetheless if you were to get</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.530" end="00:36:34.750" style="s2">your hands really dirty and then rub</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.620" end="00:36:38.620" style="s2">away that dirt chances of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.750" end="00:36:39.250" style="s2">remaining both on you and intact enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.620" end="00:36:41.980" style="s2">to function</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.250" end="00:36:43.690" style="s2">I would imagine are pretty darn low and</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.980" end="00:36:45.340" style="s2">after having rubbed your hands</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.690" end="00:36:46.810" style="s2">thoroughly in dirt for a while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.340" end="00:36:48.730" style="s2">less likely to touch your face with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.810" end="00:36:50.830" style="s2">that is true and that&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.730" end="00:36:52.600" style="s2">as I was I was gonna say is if I thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.830" end="00:36:55.930" style="s2">I had contacted it I would do what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.600" end="00:36:58.510" style="s2">could to dislodge it to gum up the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.930" end="00:37:01.210" style="s2">surface of the virus and then I would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.510" end="00:37:05.410" style="s2">very careful about not touching any part</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.210" end="00:37:08.500" style="s2">of me that could be infected and at some</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.410" end="00:37:10.510" style="s2">point I did encounter water or the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.500" end="00:37:14.080" style="s2">would no longer be viable by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.510" end="00:37:18.120" style="s2">the amount of time oh also UV light go</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.080" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">outside sunlight that&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.120" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">antiviral in this case yeah although it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">takes a while it seems how long I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">know and the type of UV that is most</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:30.100" style="s2">effective doesn&#39;t get through our</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:35.470" style="s2">atmosphere so UVC is the is the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.100" end="00:37:37.090" style="s2">quickly acting viral destroyer all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.470" end="00:37:39.490" style="s2">it&#39;d be interesting to know how long one</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.090" end="00:37:43.060" style="s2">had to expose their skin to sunlight in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.490" end="00:37:44.440" style="s2">order to to effectively neutralize the</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.060" end="00:37:49.000" style="s2">virus I agree I&#39;ve seen conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.440" end="00:37:51.130" style="s2">accounts under what circumstances would</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.000" end="00:37:52.780" style="s2">it actually be beneficial for a virus to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.130" end="00:37:56.830" style="s2">kill the host in order to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.780" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">future further mm-hmm well let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.830" end="00:38:04.830" style="s2">model it&#39;s not a virus</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:08.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a prion but the disease kuru was</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.830" end="00:38:13.210" style="s2">transmitted this this is a prion that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.200" end="00:38:18.040" style="s2">creates a encephalopathy in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.210" end="00:38:20.350" style="s2">that was transmitted I think the story</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.040" end="00:38:24.140" style="s2">is that it was transmitted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.350" end="00:38:26.360" style="s2">women who were ceremonially preparing</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.140" end="00:38:29.450" style="s2">bodies of the dead and I think eating</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.360" end="00:38:33.050" style="s2">brains this is Papua New Guinea Papua</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.450" end="00:38:35.240" style="s2">New Guinea and so anyway obviously in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.050" end="00:38:37.400" style="s2">the case of this prion the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.240" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">was resident in brain tissue and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.400" end="00:38:40.730" style="s2">the person needed to die and have their</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:43.130" style="s2">brain consumed in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.730" end="00:38:46.340" style="s2">transmitted to the next person death is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.130" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">a part of the strategy and actually we</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.340" end="00:38:58.250" style="s2">know a lot of stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:39:03.410" style="s2">cordyceps fungus is transmitted a fungus</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.250" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">that spreads by infecting often ants you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.410" end="00:39:08.270" style="s2">know is it and causing them to behave in</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:10.550" style="s2">such ways a bunch of hymenopteran ants</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.270" end="00:39:13.160" style="s2">bees and wasps and causing them to climb</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.550" end="00:39:14.900" style="s2">into the canopy and then as their body</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.160" end="00:39:18.350" style="s2">becomes totally infected with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.900" end="00:39:21.860" style="s2">cordyceps the spores basically emerge</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.350" end="00:39:24.260" style="s2">from the corpse of the body and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.860" end="00:39:26.630" style="s2">it&#39;s picked up by birds which then</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.260" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">it out and then they spreads into more</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.630" end="00:39:31.850" style="s2">yeah after in something it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:34.610" style="s2">complicated story but I think I think in</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.850" end="00:39:36.440" style="s2">that case to spread the host does end up</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.610" end="00:39:38.810" style="s2">having to die again not a virus to</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.440" end="00:39:41.540" style="s2">fungus yeah so I think I think what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.810" end="00:39:44.930" style="s2">can generally say is that if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.540" end="00:39:47.300" style="s2">plausible route for a pathogen to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.930" end="00:39:49.940" style="s2">from one critter to the next critter</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.300" end="00:39:53.120" style="s2">that involves death nature will have</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.940" end="00:39:55.550" style="s2">found it multiple times just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.120" end="00:39:58.940" style="s2">underestimate the creativity of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.550" end="00:40:02.060" style="s2">evolutionary force because it finds it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.940" end="00:40:04.790" style="s2">like water it finds the cracks and so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.060" end="00:40:07.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have a viral example but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.790" end="00:40:11.510" style="s2">not to say we couldn&#39;t come up with one</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.720" end="00:40:13.490" style="s2">yeah when will we know if the virus</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.510" end="00:40:15.140" style="s2">spread through aerosol and why do they</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.490" end="00:40:17.570" style="s2">tell people using a mask isn&#39;t effective</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.140" end="00:40:19.160" style="s2">if there are no data why do you use only</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.570" end="00:40:20.120" style="s2">water to clean vegetables but use a soap</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.160" end="00:40:22.340" style="s2">for hands so there&#39;s three questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.120" end="00:40:23.810" style="s2">when will we know if the virus is spread</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.340" end="00:40:25.670" style="s2">through aerosol I think we do know this</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.810" end="00:40:29.630" style="s2">now and in fact I think of the very</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.670" end="00:40:32.060" style="s2">first live stream I said it did and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.630" end="00:40:33.170" style="s2">I saw comment because it&#39;s the only live</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.060" end="00:40:33.750" style="s2">stream where we were actually seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.170" end="00:40:35.430" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.750" end="00:40:37.890" style="s2">and I was reminded oh no we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.430" end="00:40:40.980" style="s2">it does well as of this week or so now</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.890" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">we think it does and we being you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.980" end="00:40:44.610" style="s2">the scientific and medical establishment</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:47.010" style="s2">thinks it does spread through aerosol</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.610" end="00:40:48.870" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing I&#39;d also say if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.010" end="00:40:51.240" style="s2">heard that it didn&#39;t spread through</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.870" end="00:40:53.760" style="s2">aerosol I would strongly suspect</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.240" end="00:40:55.140" style="s2">something was wrong with data I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.760" end="00:40:57.960" style="s2">simple fact of this being closely</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.140" end="00:41:00.060" style="s2">related to common cold viruses the fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.960" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s resident in the lungs there</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.060" end="00:41:03.270" style="s2">are all kinds of reasons to think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:06.360" style="s2">aerosol would be the obvious way for</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.270" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">this to be transmitted yeah why did they</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.360" end="00:41:09.770" style="s2">tell people using a mask isn&#39;t effective</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">if there are no data I feel like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.770" end="00:41:15.510" style="s2">beaten that one a lot we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:18.120" style="s2">it a fair bit you know it feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.510" end="00:41:19.290" style="s2">unconscionable but it happened and why</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.120" end="00:41:21.210" style="s2">do you use only water to clean</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.290" end="00:41:23.340" style="s2">vegetables but use a soap for hands it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.210" end="00:41:25.980" style="s2">a very good question well I must say my</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.340" end="00:41:30.780" style="s2">behavior on this front has changed and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.980" end="00:41:33.420" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to remember but we buy</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.780" end="00:41:35.310" style="s2">organic fruits and vegetables and so in</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.420" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">general I&#39;ve been very cavalier about</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.310" end="00:41:41.160" style="s2">washing them because by and large what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:43.230" style="s2">going to be on them isn&#39;t a hazard in</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.160" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">the case of kovat 19 I&#39;m very much aware</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.230" end="00:41:46.170" style="s2">that these things have sat in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.180" style="s2">supermarket where people are walking</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.170" end="00:41:50.670" style="s2">they&#39;re touching them they&#39;re coughing</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.180" end="00:41:52.410" style="s2">and so my assumption is that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.670" end="00:41:54.210" style="s2">very highly likely place for me to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.410" end="00:41:55.950" style="s2">encounter a virus that I didn&#39;t know was</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.210" end="00:41:58.920" style="s2">there because I didn&#39;t go out you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.950" end="00:42:02.610" style="s2">for example so every piece of fruit that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.920" end="00:42:04.290" style="s2">I eat now I wash it with soap so well if</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.610" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s an apple for instance but</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.290" end="00:42:08.820" style="s2">if it&#39;s citrus its it comes with its own</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:11.670" style="s2">casing right so do you wash citrus as</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.820" end="00:42:13.950" style="s2">well I I&#39;m not as religious about it but</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.670" end="00:42:15.840" style="s2">I&#39;m close because to touch it and peel</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.950" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">it runs the risk that I will you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.840" end="00:42:21.540" style="s2">just like there&#39;s no Salmonella inside</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">of an egg but the shell is almond Ella</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.540" end="00:42:26.940" style="s2">we&#39;ll get into the egg as you break the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:29.340" style="s2">shell I would say it&#39;s the same it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.940" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">same thing so I would say the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.340" end="00:42:34.530" style="s2">soap is your friend in this case soap</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:36.270" style="s2">your washing machine your dishwasher all</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.530" end="00:42:40.680" style="s2">of these things are mechanisms whereby</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.270" end="00:42:43.410" style="s2">you can easily sterilize whatever kovat</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.680" end="00:42:45.270" style="s2">19 you have on whatever it is out of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.410" end="00:42:46.750" style="s2">existence and in the case of fruit it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.270" end="00:42:48.130" style="s2">a pretty or fruit and vegetable</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.750" end="00:42:50.410" style="s2">it&#39;s you know if you&#39;re cooking the</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.130" end="00:42:50.950" style="s2">vegetables it&#39;s a probably not that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.410" end="00:42:52.570" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.950" end="00:42:54.070" style="s2">I mean this is I do a lot more cooking</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.570" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">of vegetables than you do so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.070" end="00:43:00.310" style="s2">preparing you know peppers which our</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:01.750" style="s2">boys love fresh I wash peppers not in</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.310" end="00:43:03.190" style="s2">hot water because if you&#39;re eating fresh</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.750" end="00:43:04.780" style="s2">peppers you don&#39;t really want them to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.190" end="00:43:07.330" style="s2">have been heated but I do wash them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.780" end="00:43:09.340" style="s2">so cucumbers in appealing which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.330" end="00:43:12.520" style="s2">normally wouldn&#39;t necessarily be you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.340" end="00:43:15.220" style="s2">know always peel cauliflower it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.520" end="00:43:17.380" style="s2">be cooked in the oven for a long time we</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.220" end="00:43:18.820" style="s2">have you know or fried whatever but if</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.380" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be if it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.820" end="00:43:22.630" style="s2">experience high heat for long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:24.700" style="s2">time you don&#39;t need to bring soap to it</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.630" end="00:43:26.500" style="s2">but if you&#39;re going to be eating it raw</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.700" end="00:43:30.990" style="s2">yeah you really need to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.500" end="00:43:30.990" style="s2">and the question is exactly right yep</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.800" end="00:43:39.550" style="s2">where are we I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.900" end="00:43:41.380" style="s2">does Oh does this hemoglobin hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.550" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">explain why certain blood types appear</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.380" end="00:43:45.580" style="s2">to be more at risk</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:50.110" style="s2">good well because it involves virus</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.580" end="00:43:51.730" style="s2">entering Wow actually it cannot I hope</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.110" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">I&#39;m right about this but I&#39;ve got to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.730" end="00:43:59.230" style="s2">it cannot reproduce itself I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:01.260" style="s2">it can reproduce itself in red blood</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.230" end="00:44:06.940" style="s2">cells because red blood cells are</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.260" end="00:44:08.740" style="s2">enucleated so it&#39;s the hemoglobin well</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.940" end="00:44:10.210" style="s2">this is a question which I&#39;m sure I</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.740" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">should know the answer to but how do red</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.210" end="00:44:14.530" style="s2">blood cells they are produced by other</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">tissues so they&#39;re not might they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.530" end="00:44:19.720" style="s2">undergo mitosis correct so they are</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:24.730" style="s2">produced by other tissues and then ever</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.720" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">yeah yeah they can&#39;t in mammals in birds</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.730" end="00:44:32.380" style="s2">but the point is because they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:34.420" style="s2">a nucleus they are not doing I believe</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.380" end="00:44:36.580" style="s2">they do not have any of the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.420" end="00:44:39.850" style="s2">necessary to do the viral work and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.580" end="00:44:42.540" style="s2">therefore the invasion of these cells to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.850" end="00:44:46.600" style="s2">get to the hemoglobin molecules must be</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.540" end="00:44:48.430" style="s2">some other process unfolding so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.600" end="00:44:50.560" style="s2">think the answer to your question is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.430" end="00:44:52.990" style="s2">potentially plays in we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.560" end="00:44:55.180" style="s2">but it is certainly worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.990" end="00:44:59.980" style="s2">the antigens on the surface of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.180" end="00:45:02.990" style="s2">cells that&#39;s where the ABO</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.980" end="00:45:05.740" style="s2">blood groups and the the rhesus factor</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.990" end="00:45:07.849" style="s2">come from that those things might be</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.740" end="00:45:11.390" style="s2">critically important in terms of how the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.849" end="00:45:12.380" style="s2">virus gets into those cells you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.390" end="00:45:13.970" style="s2">mentioned you had things in place for</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.380" end="00:45:16.519" style="s2">the collapse of systems what were they</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.970" end="00:45:22.579" style="s2">also what worries you mark Ovid 19r a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.519" end="00:45:24.680" style="s2">heightened Cold War with China I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.579" end="00:45:25.700" style="s2">remember what the mention of having</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.680" end="00:45:27.349" style="s2">things in place for the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.700" end="00:45:28.970" style="s2">systems I said we&#39;ve caught a little off</p>

<p begin="00:45:30.680" end="00:45:34.970" style="s2">problem is we didn&#39;t take a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.380" end="00:45:37.130" style="s2">with us we also live in different</p>

<p begin="00:45:37.130" end="00:45:41.059" style="s2">did in Olympia and so some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.289" end="00:45:43.579" style="s2">wasn&#39;t relevant some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.059" end="00:45:46.549" style="s2">changed in priority but to give you one</p>

<p begin="00:45:53.930" end="00:45:57.829" style="s2">tools was that in the absence of</p>

<p begin="00:50:20.900" end="00:50:25.400" style="s2">on should you become sick how do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:27.170" style="s2">stay out of that third category how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.400" end="00:50:29.299" style="s2">do we know about that and I must say</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.170" end="00:50:32.269" style="s2">maybe somebody knows but the information</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.299" end="00:50:34.460" style="s2">has not percolated to me it&#39;s all been</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.269" end="00:50:37.369" style="s2">focused on the epidemiology how you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.460" end="00:50:39.380" style="s2">avoid getting infected in the first</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.380" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">all that great there but I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.869" end="00:50:47.210" style="s2">know about the how to stay out of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:49.789" style="s2">the crisis category yeah I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.210" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">seen some numbers around it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.789" end="00:50:53.119" style="s2">people than you think who are young or</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.759" style="s2">have no underlying conditions who end up</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.119" end="00:50:57.079" style="s2">hospitalized or very sick but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.759" end="00:50:59.420" style="s2">here that I have no idea how to do is</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.079" end="00:51:01.339" style="s2">compared to to what diseases you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.420" end="00:51:03.829" style="s2">what would be the right comparison to</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.339" end="00:51:05.539" style="s2">make here yeah next question are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.829" end="00:51:09.529" style="s2">any beneficial viruses that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.539" end="00:51:11.450" style="s2">beneficial to us god there must be why</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.529" end="00:51:17.269" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t why wouldn&#39;t there be at some</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.450" end="00:51:19.460" style="s2">level in which the strategy is is one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.269" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">effectively collaboration in which they</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.460" end="00:51:23.450" style="s2">they win and do and so do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:25.609" style="s2">I can&#39;t think of any at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.450" end="00:51:27.529" style="s2">though I think part of the problem here</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.609" end="00:51:28.970" style="s2">is that if they were beneficial viruses</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.529" end="00:51:31.430" style="s2">you might not know that they were viral</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.970" end="00:51:34.579" style="s2">in other words if if a virus was</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.430" end="00:51:37.039" style="s2">benefiting us and unambiguously it might</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.579" end="00:51:41.420" style="s2">find that it became integrated into our</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.039" end="00:51:43.010" style="s2">germline genome and then you might not</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.420" end="00:51:46.390" style="s2">know that that gene had moved</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.010" end="00:51:48.530" style="s2">horizontally into into that position</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.390" end="00:51:50.809" style="s2">there might be ways of figuring it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.530" end="00:51:54.140" style="s2">but my guess would be to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.809" end="00:51:55.640" style="s2">such things have evolved we will be late</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.140" end="00:51:59.720" style="s2">to find them because we will think of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.640" end="00:52:06.859" style="s2">them as as our genes rather than genes</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.720" end="00:52:09.950" style="s2">that came to us in some way good this so</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.140" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">this is this is a problem with this type</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.390" end="00:54:54.200" style="s2">of thinking or it&#39;s like oh I have a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:57.289" style="s2">category and I have evidence that all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.200" end="00:54:59.029" style="s2">these new drugs may cause harm I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.289" end="00:55:02.239" style="s2">put the other thing which is a much</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.029" end="00:55:04.279" style="s2">older drug and that in into that list</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.239" end="00:55:05.059" style="s2">because it fits in this category that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.279" end="00:55:07.789" style="s2">have yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.059" end="00:55:12.289" style="s2">in fact aspirin you know aspirin is very</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.789" end="00:55:15.980" style="s2">old it it it comes out is it willows</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.289" end="00:55:19.119" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s something which you willow</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.980" end="00:55:22.009" style="s2">bark yeah it it is derived from</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.119" end="00:55:24.739" style="s2">something that humans have been using as</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.009" end="00:55:27.319" style="s2">a municipal for thousands of years which</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.739" end="00:55:29.180" style="s2">is far different from a drug that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.319" end="00:55:33.829" style="s2">dreamed up in a lab within the few</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.180" end="00:55:35.420" style="s2">decades and the dosages again I hope I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.829" end="00:55:38.749" style="s2">getting the story right for the dosages</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.420" end="00:55:41.829" style="s2">that were being used around the Spanish</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.749" end="00:55:44.089" style="s2">flu were super high absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.829" end="00:55:47.170" style="s2">astonishingly high and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.089" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">probably destructive in their own right</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.170" end="00:55:53.980" style="s2">let&#39;s see Oh what can we so the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:58.420" style="s2">thing about Spanish flu is its flu and</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.980" end="00:56:03.619" style="s2">flu has this mechanism for switching</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.420" end="00:56:05.299" style="s2">components and so because this because</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.619" end="00:56:07.069" style="s2">coronavirus is function in a different</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.299" end="00:56:09.410" style="s2">way there also</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.069" end="00:56:13.430" style="s2">but non retroviruses that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.410" end="00:56:16.369" style="s2">have they don&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.430" end="00:56:21.170" style="s2">switch up antigens in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.369" end="00:56:22.549" style="s2">said they because of what we talked</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.170" end="00:56:23.779" style="s2">about in the livestream and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.549" end="00:56:25.279" style="s2">that they appear to have this error</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.779" end="00:56:26.839" style="s2">correction mechanism which we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.279" end="00:56:28.699" style="s2">arguing is something that could be</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.839" end="00:56:30.199" style="s2">turned on or turned off it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.699" end="00:56:32.479" style="s2">they have some other mechanism but</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.199" end="00:56:34.579" style="s2">really I would just I guess what you</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.479" end="00:56:36.289" style="s2">said up front is is probably the right</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.579" end="00:56:37.910" style="s2">answer to the question we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.289" end="00:56:39.769" style="s2">that they will have seasonality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.910" end="00:56:41.650" style="s2">reason to think some seasonality will</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.769" end="00:56:43.849" style="s2">emerge from people&#39;s change in behavior</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.650" end="00:56:46.069" style="s2">but there&#39;s very little reason to think</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.849" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">that the seasonality will emerge from it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.069" end="00:56:51.799" style="s2">being wired to go dormant during the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:53.329" style="s2">summer the way other things seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.799" end="00:56:54.589" style="s2">okay I think we need to speed it up we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.329" end="00:56:56.839" style="s2">got I don&#39;t know how many more questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.589" end="00:56:58.279" style="s2">we have Zack but we&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.839" end="00:57:00.829" style="s2">trying to answer these much more quickly</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.279" end="00:57:04.729" style="s2">okay so does the error correcting</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.829" end="00:57:06.529" style="s2">mechanism so is the error correcting</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.729" end="00:57:10.569" style="s2">mechanism a good thing or bad thing with</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.529" end="00:57:13.249" style="s2">regard to how we deal with kovat 19 oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.569" end="00:57:14.839" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a good could go either way</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.249" end="00:57:18.349" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a good thing as it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.839" end="00:57:20.569" style="s2">probably stabilizes the virus so that it</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.349" end="00:57:22.819" style="s2">is not rapidly changing which means that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.569" end="00:57:25.609" style="s2">it lower rate of mutagenesis so easier</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.819" end="00:57:27.739" style="s2">to target if we can get a vaccine that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.609" end="00:57:31.190" style="s2">functions against it it will not morph</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.739" end="00:57:33.079" style="s2">out from under us it will remain steady</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.190" end="00:57:36.650" style="s2">so that&#39;s why if it could turn that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.079" end="00:57:38.390" style="s2">mechanism off it might evade but but</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.650" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">also it&#39;s an error correcting mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.390" end="00:57:41.989" style="s2">that&#39;s that we currently think it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:47.029" style="s2">what else can it do you know can it can</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.989" end="00:57:49.509" style="s2">it is it is it a multi-part factory that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.029" end="00:57:53.660" style="s2">can produce all sorts of things besides</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.509" end="00:57:55.099" style="s2">fixing mutations who knows don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.660" end="00:57:57.319" style="s2">we got rid of influenza would people</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.099" end="00:58:01.160" style="s2">without immunity to it die if it came</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.319" end="00:58:02.779" style="s2">back mmm some people would as some</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.160" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">people die of influenza every year as</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.779" end="00:58:07.699" style="s2">many people die of influenza every year</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">but would it be more all right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.699" end="00:58:11.990" style="s2">only suspect so yeah probably because</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:16.280" style="s2">you have a series of</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.990" end="00:58:18.470" style="s2">counters with the flu you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.280" end="00:58:20.330" style="s2">a head start on chasing it down when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.470" end="00:58:22.490" style="s2">get infected yeah I&#39;d be very good</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.330" end="00:58:25.250" style="s2">Braddock ating it completely would make</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.490" end="00:58:29.270" style="s2">a reintroduction potentially more deadly</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.250" end="00:58:30.980" style="s2">yes yep my interpretation of masks don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.270" end="00:58:32.990" style="s2">work is that it is false</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.980" end="00:58:34.760" style="s2">literally false but metaphorically true</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.990" end="00:58:36.350" style="s2">regular people with masks will still rub</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.760" end="00:58:37.580" style="s2">their eyes or the equivalent reserving</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.350" end="00:58:41.600" style="s2">the supply for professionals is</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.580" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">important yes and now I think the thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.600" end="00:58:49.030" style="s2">is I&#39;ve seen so much this year where</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:51.770" style="s2">people are essentially arguing that that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.030" end="00:58:54.350" style="s2">complexity is something normal folks</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.770" end="00:58:57.710" style="s2">can&#39;t handle so we have to dumb stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.350" end="00:59:00.619" style="s2">down I don&#39;t think this is true I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.710" end="00:59:02.180" style="s2">we&#39;re now watching people level up and</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.619" end="00:59:05.150" style="s2">the fact is they could be weeks ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.180" end="00:59:10.190" style="s2">where they are if we had been straight</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.150" end="00:59:12.470" style="s2">with them up front so I certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.190" end="00:59:14.630" style="s2">think we know that people couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.470" end="00:59:16.670" style="s2">handle the raw truth if we simply gave</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.630" end="00:59:19.070" style="s2">it to them and frankly I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.670" end="00:59:21.050" style="s2">immoral to assume that they can&#39;t and to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.070" end="00:59:24.200" style="s2">deliver them these kinds of fictions</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.050" end="00:59:27.050" style="s2">this is not a thousand years ago this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.200" end="00:59:28.760" style="s2">modern times we have the internet we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.050" end="00:59:30.170" style="s2">talk each other through this let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.760" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">honest with each other about where we</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.170" end="00:59:34.550" style="s2">are what works what resources are too</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:35.930" style="s2">limited where they should go and what</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.550" end="00:59:38.119" style="s2">the rest of us should be doing and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.930" end="00:59:40.070" style="s2">do it now yeah so I&#39;m going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.119" end="00:59:41.600" style="s2">to the next question but two questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.070" end="00:59:43.070" style="s2">later is actually relevant to this so</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.600" end="00:59:44.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll just go there seems that the spread</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.070" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">and cultures wear masks of the social</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.690" end="00:59:49.220" style="s2">norm has been significantly mitigated it</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.359" end="00:59:50.900" style="s2">may be spurious of course because there</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.220" end="00:59:51.710" style="s2">are other correlated factors but I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.900" end="00:59:56.119" style="s2">this is right</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.710" end="00:59:59.210" style="s2">and we have not even begun to untangle</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.119" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">all of the other factors yet but but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.210" end="01:00:03.710" style="s2">it seems like a good initial observation</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:05.420" style="s2">at any rate and so then the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.710" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">before that was can you talk more about</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.420" end="01:00:11.180" style="s2">cats on kovat 19 mm-hmm yeah so we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:14.060" style="s2">going to I don&#39;t have the article with</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.180" end="01:00:16.810" style="s2">me here today but piece came out</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.060" end="01:00:21.050" style="s2">sometime in the last week we can have</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.810" end="01:00:22.910" style="s2">suggesting that it&#39;s not saris Cove to</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.050" end="01:00:24.350" style="s2">is not transmissible to dogs although</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.910" end="01:00:25.760" style="s2">you would independently found two cases</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.350" end="01:00:29.740" style="s2">of dogs I might have had it</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:34.700" style="s2">but the cats and ferrets apparently can</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.740" end="01:00:36.800" style="s2">can get kovat 19 and then more recently</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.700" end="01:00:39.740" style="s2">yet we have this case of the tiger at</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.800" end="01:00:41.510" style="s2">the Brooklyn zoo some some zoo</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.740" end="01:00:47.060" style="s2">that&#39;s not forgotten which I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.510" end="01:00:50.420" style="s2">assume is some New York zoo and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.060" end="01:00:55.150" style="s2">about all we know at least that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.420" end="01:00:55.150" style="s2">about all I know at this point is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.510" end="01:01:02.500" style="s2">unfortunately it seems that two of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.810" end="01:01:05.440" style="s2">domesticated partner animals can get it</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.500" end="01:01:08.690" style="s2">potentially from us and potentially then</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.440" end="01:01:11.030" style="s2">within within each other you know spread</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.690" end="01:01:13.460" style="s2">it to each other so I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.030" end="01:01:17.420" style="s2">really to be expected yeah the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.460" end="01:01:19.220" style="s2">these coronaviruses seem to live in bats</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.420" end="01:01:21.250" style="s2">and find their way into other creatures</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.220" end="01:01:24.800" style="s2">and what that says is that they are</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.250" end="01:01:26.090" style="s2">generalist when it comes to what what</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.800" end="01:01:29.660" style="s2">sorts of animals that they can make a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.090" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">profit with so anyway we should expect</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.660" end="01:01:35.630" style="s2">it what I what I haven&#39;t seen is that</p>

<p begin="01:01:35.630" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">to people yeah we haven&#39;t seen in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.550" end="01:01:40.340" style="s2">direction we haven&#39;t seen that asymmetry</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:41.420" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s not to say it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.340" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">possible but we haven&#39;t seen any</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.420" end="01:01:45.710" style="s2">evidence of that right and so that will</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:49.220" style="s2">be a very positive thing if that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.710" end="01:01:50.420" style="s2">common mode of transmission yeah seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.220" end="01:01:52.160" style="s2">of the SPRO we already read that one</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.420" end="01:01:53.690" style="s2">should we petition public parks to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.160" end="01:01:55.609" style="s2">reopened do you think the closure of</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.690" end="01:01:57.170" style="s2">public lands and parks is an example of</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.609" end="01:01:59.210" style="s2">tyranny on the part of the executives</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.170" end="01:02:01.400" style="s2">who have issued these closures well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.210" end="01:02:03.740" style="s2">been pretty clear how I feel about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.400" end="01:02:05.900" style="s2">I think public parks should be reopened</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.740" end="01:02:07.100" style="s2">I understand that there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.900" end="01:02:09.410" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know how to behave</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.100" end="01:02:15.859" style="s2">themselves once they go out on mass and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.410" end="01:02:18.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve been cooped up but that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.859" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">being able to experience being outside</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.080" end="01:02:24.400" style="s2">and in landscapes that are that have</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:28.550" style="s2">fresh air and sunlight and nature and</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.400" end="01:02:31.670" style="s2">and animals besides humans to experience</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.550" end="01:02:33.819" style="s2">is going to be absolutely critical in</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.670" end="01:02:36.789" style="s2">terms of being able to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.819" end="01:02:39.699" style="s2">last psychologically through these this</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.789" end="01:02:41.380" style="s2">quarantine and lockdown is the closure</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.699" end="01:02:43.660" style="s2">and example of tyranny on the part of</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.380" end="01:02:46.089" style="s2">the executives I wouldn&#39;t use that word</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.660" end="01:02:48.279" style="s2">but I see why it&#39;s being used</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.089" end="01:02:50.920" style="s2">I think it&#39;s overreach I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.279" end="01:02:53.380" style="s2">confusion I think it is misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.920" end="01:02:56.289" style="s2">what the point of social distancing is I</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.380" end="01:02:58.959" style="s2">think it fails to recognize that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.289" end="01:03:01.769" style="s2">there is an effective viral load and</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.959" end="01:03:04.180" style="s2">that being staying away from people and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.769" end="01:03:05.410" style="s2">presumably you know especially if like I</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.180" end="01:03:07.869" style="s2">said like we said earlier if you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.410" end="01:03:10.259" style="s2">trails that are narrow and you may run</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.869" end="01:03:13.150" style="s2">into someone who&#39;s running the other way</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.259" end="01:03:14.380" style="s2">they should be masked and it would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.150" end="01:03:18.729" style="s2">better if you could be masked in</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.380" end="01:03:21.640" style="s2">response weeks ago I was in the hundreds</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.729" end="01:03:23.890" style="s2">acre park near our house and three guys</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.640" end="01:03:25.539" style="s2">ran past me with no masks on breathing</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.890" end="01:03:27.339" style="s2">heavily and I thought that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.539" end="01:03:28.749" style="s2">good like that is that is not what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.339" end="01:03:32.709" style="s2">want when you&#39;re going out into nature</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.749" end="01:03:35.019" style="s2">but other than that what I saw mostly</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.709" end="01:03:38.410" style="s2">was a lot of people mostly older who</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.019" end="01:03:41.259" style="s2">were outside enjoying the landscape and</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.410" end="01:03:43.599" style="s2">presumably they&#39;re not now and that is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.259" end="01:03:45.519" style="s2">hundred percent making them more at risk</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.599" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">of getting sick from other things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.519" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">making them more at risk of falling into</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:52.959" style="s2">psychological disarray as well</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:54.400" style="s2">there is tyranny I don&#39;t think the park</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.959" end="01:03:57.309" style="s2">thing is it there is other stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.400" end="01:04:01.239" style="s2">legislative stuff that yes much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.309" end="01:04:03.309" style="s2">credibly tyrannical but this is another</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.239" end="01:04:06.190" style="s2">opportunity why aren&#39;t we talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.309" end="01:04:09.309" style="s2">how we can go back to using parks in</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.190" end="01:04:11.709" style="s2">public lands safely frankly people are</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.309" end="01:04:14.319" style="s2">talking about our predicament almost</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.709" end="01:04:16.299" style="s2">full time we can talk about how it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.319" end="01:04:18.219" style="s2">that one uses a park in the situation</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.299" end="01:04:20.499" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s no trash collection maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.219" end="01:04:21.759" style="s2">you carry out what you bring in maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.499" end="01:04:24.219" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain number of feet you</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.759" end="01:04:26.349" style="s2">need to stand in the park and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.219" end="01:04:27.849" style="s2">what we can infer from the supermarket</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.349" end="01:04:29.619" style="s2">but why aren&#39;t we having the discussion</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.849" end="01:04:31.959" style="s2">yeah there there are enough of us with</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.619" end="01:04:34.839" style="s2">experience in the back country who know</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.959" end="01:04:37.059" style="s2">who know how to inform others of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.839" end="01:04:38.859" style="s2">like Leave No Trace and it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.059" end="01:04:40.690" style="s2">that it will be perfect and one thing I</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.859" end="01:04:42.069" style="s2">will say is that on these walks that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.690" end="01:04:44.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve been taking with the dog I have</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.069" end="01:04:46.870" style="s2">seen an unfortunate uptick of finding</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.680" end="01:04:49.120" style="s2">piles of dog poo that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.870" end="01:04:52.450" style="s2">left by our dog because I can we clean</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.120" end="01:04:53.980" style="s2">it up so that seems like a failure that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.450" end="01:04:56.200" style="s2">is happening now that I never would have</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.980" end="01:04:58.300" style="s2">run into you know three months ago</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.200" end="01:05:00.130" style="s2">people would have always cleaned it up</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.300" end="01:05:03.490" style="s2">and somehow there was social enforcement</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.130" end="01:05:07.450" style="s2">that no longer exists but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.490" end="01:05:10.090" style="s2">that people are absolutely educated have</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.450" end="01:05:11.560" style="s2">our parks reopened without explaining</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.090" end="01:05:12.700" style="s2">exactly the next question without</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.560" end="01:05:14.170" style="s2">explaining exactly what the fourth</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.700" end="01:05:15.970" style="s2">frontier is please answer the following</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.170" end="01:05:17.050" style="s2">is it a laid out plan or more of a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.970" end="01:05:18.610" style="s2">thought experiment and can</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.050" end="01:05:20.350" style="s2">all-encompassing plan be developed from</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.610" end="01:05:23.650" style="s2">where does it have to evolve I think we</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.350" end="01:05:25.810" style="s2">went there right yeah it it is a I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.650" end="01:05:28.090" style="s2">the core inside of the fourth frontier</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.810" end="01:05:31.030" style="s2">is that we cannot describe it in advance</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.090" end="01:05:34.450" style="s2">what we can do is algorithmically</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.030" end="01:05:38.020" style="s2">navigate to it so one needs to spell out</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.450" end="01:05:40.540" style="s2">something that is viable but the attempt</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.020" end="01:05:42.430" style="s2">to make it precise upfront would doom it</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.540" end="01:05:45.610" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a thought experiment it</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.430" end="01:05:48.550" style="s2">really is about where we all ought to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.610" end="01:05:51.100" style="s2">together how we how we architect that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.550" end="01:05:52.690" style="s2">system but it will not be done from a</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.100" end="01:05:54.910" style="s2">blueprint it will be done as a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.690" end="01:05:58.540" style="s2">navigation on what we would call the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.910" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">adaptive landscape if now why 86 a</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.540" end="01:06:02.020" style="s2">youtuber whose content has mainly</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:04.300" style="s2">focused on China is correct and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.020" end="01:06:06.760" style="s2">know what this is so that&#39;s a that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.300" end="01:06:08.710" style="s2">if what do we do if this was something</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.760" end="01:06:11.470" style="s2">released accidentally or purposefully by</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.710" end="01:06:13.900" style="s2">Wuhan and the Communist Party of China</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.470" end="01:06:17.650" style="s2">should China face any repercussions and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.900" end="01:06:19.690" style="s2">how it&#39;s a big question I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.650" end="01:06:22.450" style="s2">very different if it was purposefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.690" end="01:06:26.080" style="s2">versus accidentally yeah it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.450" end="01:06:27.520" style="s2">questions I think maybe we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.080" end="01:06:30.340" style="s2">come back to that we&#39;ve touched on this</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.520" end="01:06:32.320" style="s2">before but we I mean if it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.340" end="01:06:35.950" style="s2">purposefully done it&#39;s mass murder yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.320" end="01:06:38.290" style="s2">right if it was accidental then it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.950" end="01:06:41.140" style="s2">obviously something that must never</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.290" end="01:06:42.790" style="s2">happen again and we have to navigate it</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.140" end="01:06:44.740" style="s2">but just the two questions aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.790" end="01:06:47.320" style="s2">in the same ball if it was accidental it</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.740" end="01:06:48.790" style="s2">could have it could have happened and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.320" end="01:06:50.110" style="s2">won&#39;t say just as easily because there</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.790" end="01:06:51.250" style="s2">are different structures in place in</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.110" end="01:06:53.110" style="s2">different countries but it could have</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.250" end="01:06:56.170" style="s2">happened in any country that has</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.110" end="01:06:59.590" style="s2">virology labs which is certainly you</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.170" end="01:07:00.430" style="s2">know most most industrialized countries</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.590" end="01:07:02.800" style="s2">if not all in a</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.460" end="01:07:08.410" style="s2">well they need they need not to and yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.830" end="01:07:11.110" style="s2">they still do I used to handle bats as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.410" end="01:07:12.850" style="s2">matter of my graduate work I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.110" end="01:07:16.390" style="s2">those bats were particularly likely to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.850" end="01:07:18.370" style="s2">to house a human transmissible virus</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.390" end="01:07:19.510" style="s2">that could cause a pandemic like this as</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.370" end="01:07:22.300" style="s2">a result of the fact that they were</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.510" end="01:07:25.450" style="s2">roosting in small groups under leaves</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.300" end="01:07:27.100" style="s2">rather than in caves where the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.450" end="01:07:30.670" style="s2">epidemiology is different but</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.100" end="01:07:32.860" style="s2">nonetheless every scientist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.670" end="01:07:36.310" style="s2">handling wild animals is running some</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.860" end="01:07:39.040" style="s2">risk of transmitting this stuff to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.310" end="01:07:40.840" style="s2">human population how we navigate that so</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.040" end="01:07:43.210" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t happen again from some</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.840" end="01:07:48.100" style="s2">other source that&#39;s a very valid</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.210" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">question but people are handling animals</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.100" end="01:07:53.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s putting humanity at risk and</p>

<p begin="01:10:09.719" end="01:10:16.420" style="s2">livestream well and you know we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.349" end="01:10:18.670" style="s2">animals with which we have a very long</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.420" end="01:10:20.619" style="s2">history we know what diseases they carry</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.670" end="01:10:23.590" style="s2">we understand how to manage those</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.619" end="01:10:25.900" style="s2">diseases and these creatures are have</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.590" end="01:10:27.880" style="s2">effectively become our partners and I</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.900" end="01:10:30.460" style="s2">know lots of people think it&#39;s mean to</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.880" end="01:10:33.429" style="s2">eat animals but the fact is driving them</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.460" end="01:10:35.619" style="s2">extinct isn&#39;t better so we should be</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.429" end="01:10:37.929" style="s2">limiting the amount of animal meat that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.619" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">we eat because it&#39;s environmentally</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.929" end="01:10:42.760" style="s2">destructive but should it be zero no</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:45.369" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to for it to be zero</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.760" end="01:10:46.989" style="s2">it&#39;s not a healthy diet it&#39;s much easier</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.369" end="01:10:49.960" style="s2">to be healthy if you eat some meat and</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.989" end="01:10:52.929" style="s2">so there is a rational middle ground</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.960" end="01:10:55.560" style="s2">here and the extremes neither of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.929" end="01:11:00.429" style="s2">are wracked yeah are we doing better by</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.560" end="01:11:04.300" style="s2">cows or bison you know cows by almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.429" end="01:11:07.210" style="s2">every metric some anecdotal reporting on</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.300" end="01:11:09.159" style="s2">the type of coronavirus death includes</p>

<p begin="01:11:29.290" end="01:11:32.349" style="s2">and what we haven&#39;t heard anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.250" end="01:11:34.059" style="s2">definitive on patient zero what</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.349" end="01:11:36.159" style="s2">advantages could be had from withholding</p>

<p begin="01:11:36.159" end="01:11:41.889" style="s2">hypotheses not theories but we&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.150" end="01:11:43.929" style="s2">a little bit about the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.889" end="01:11:46.900" style="s2">patient zero a woman who seems to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.929" end="01:11:49.770" style="s2">disappeared from the lab in Wuhan I</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.900" end="01:11:55.360" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine why it would be worth</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.770" end="01:11:57.460" style="s2">without her body disappeared or well she</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.360" end="01:12:00.280" style="s2">was an employee of the lab in Wuhan she</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.460" end="01:12:02.559" style="s2">was at this story could be nonsense I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.280" end="01:12:05.079" style="s2">not in a position to assess it at all</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.559" end="01:12:07.179" style="s2">all I can say is I&#39;ve seen the claim</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.079" end="01:12:10.000" style="s2">that there was a woman working in this</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.179" end="01:12:13.210" style="s2">laboratory who many people take to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.000" end="01:12:17.650" style="s2">patient zero and that she disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.210" end="01:12:20.829" style="s2">her data was scrubbed from the website I</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.650" end="01:12:24.369" style="s2">believe the government claims that she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.829" end="01:12:27.309" style="s2">alive and well and doing fine and but</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.369" end="01:12:28.780" style="s2">there&#39;s no evidence of her again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.309" end="01:12:33.909" style="s2">know if that&#39;s a garbage story I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.780" end="01:12:38.710" style="s2">fed or not but what I do know is there</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.909" end="01:12:41.260" style="s2">does seem to be a connection between the</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.710" end="01:12:45.159" style="s2">lab in Wuhan and the studying of these</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.260" end="01:12:48.429" style="s2">viruses that is very hard to ignore the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.159" end="01:12:51.570" style="s2">wet market connection seems tentative</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.429" end="01:12:54.280" style="s2">the more you try to chase it down and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.570" end="01:12:56.170" style="s2">there does seem to be a very likely</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.280" end="01:12:59.650" style="s2">explanation which is that this thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.170" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">escaped as a result of a lab that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.650" end="01:13:05.860" style="s2">sufficiently careful and maybe the CCP</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.760" end="01:13:07.420" style="s2">wishes us not to understand that and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.860" end="01:13:09.699" style="s2">the cover story being a wet market</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.420" end="01:13:12.969" style="s2">requires that there was no patient zero</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.699" end="01:13:17.699" style="s2">in the lab maybe that&#39;s it but yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.969" end="01:13:20.530" style="s2">withholding the information is criminal</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.699" end="01:13:23.230" style="s2">the release the accidental release would</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.530" end="01:13:24.309" style="s2">not be but hiding the information that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.230" end="01:13:27.070" style="s2">would allow us to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.309" end="01:13:28.750" style="s2">actually happened is certainly</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.070" end="01:13:31.929" style="s2">tantamount to a crime if it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.750" end="01:13:33.369" style="s2">actually one yeah you two are exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.929" end="01:13:34.690" style="s2">the kind of people that I want to hear</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.369" end="01:13:36.070" style="s2">from at a time like this thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.690" end="01:13:38.290" style="s2">doing it thank you</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.070" end="01:13:40.329" style="s2">if I had a time machine and went back a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.290" end="01:13:42.010" style="s2">thousand years would my immune system</p>

<p begin="01:13:44.500" end="01:13:48.219" style="s2">what I&#39;d be completely unprepared for</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:49.300" style="s2">that eras virus&#39;s question that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.219" end="01:13:52.510" style="s2">great question it would be neither</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.300" end="01:13:54.040" style="s2">extreme there there are certainly new</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.510" end="01:13:57.610" style="s2">things that have emerged that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.040" end="01:13:58.809" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be that that you were prepared</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.610" end="01:14:01.179" style="s2">for now that you wouldn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.809" end="01:14:04.059" style="s2">preparation for back then but there</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.179" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">presumably also be older viruses that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.059" end="01:14:08.170" style="s2">have either been extirpated or have</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:10.239" style="s2">changed so much that your modern</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.170" end="01:14:11.980" style="s2">antibodies wouldn&#39;t do a good enough job</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.239" end="01:14:13.840" style="s2">on dealing with the older ones yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.980" end="01:14:15.579" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s kind of likely that</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.840" end="01:14:17.010" style="s2">you know especially with their having</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.579" end="01:14:20.469" style="s2">been bottlenecks in the human population</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.010" end="01:14:22.389" style="s2">that some infections will have been lost</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.469" end="01:14:25.739" style="s2">yeah and they might function like a</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.389" end="01:14:28.690" style="s2">truly naive population encountering</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.739" end="01:14:32.380" style="s2">smallpox right so a superhero with a few</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.690" end="01:14:34.119" style="s2">kryptonite&#39;s yeah thank you for doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.380" end="01:14:35.770" style="s2">these if you have time and want to</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.119" end="01:14:39.099" style="s2">laughs check out our last video on</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.770" end="01:14:42.849" style="s2">televangelists and code 19 what are your</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.099" end="01:14:47.070" style="s2">thoughts on them they are highly</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.849" end="01:14:47.070" style="s2">unlikely to be an effective remedy</p>

<p begin="01:14:49.480" end="01:14:53.380" style="s2">academic can you speak to your vision of</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.340" end="01:14:55.770" style="s2">hope for alternative scholarship and</p>

<p begin="01:14:55.770" end="01:15:00.099" style="s2">this is this is something we&#39;ve spent a</p>

<p begin="01:15:06.790" end="01:15:10.090" style="s2">think we have time right now</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.690" end="01:15:11.949" style="s2">um we&#39;re overthinking education and</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.090" end="01:15:14.920" style="s2">under thinking it at the same time the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.949" end="01:15:18.159" style="s2">fact is it&#39;s a normal thing we&#39;re built</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.920" end="01:15:21.099" style="s2">to do it and our system that is designed</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.159" end="01:15:25.719" style="s2">to deliver education in an economically</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.099" end="01:15:28.659" style="s2">efficient fashion is obscene so we need</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.719" end="01:15:30.550" style="s2">to remember what education is for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.659" end="01:15:33.790" style="s2">supposed to teach you how to think not</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.550" end="01:15:35.079" style="s2">what to think and we need to build a</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.790" end="01:15:38.520" style="s2">system that&#39;s capable of doing that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.079" end="01:15:41.590" style="s2">which means it&#39;s a system that has to</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.520" end="01:15:43.750" style="s2">acquire and protect the kind of minds</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.590" end="01:15:45.489" style="s2">who are actually in a position to</p>

<p begin="01:15:52.370" end="01:15:57.470" style="s2">I think the question in some sense if we</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.580" end="01:15:59.450" style="s2">have the courage to see why our system</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.470" end="01:16:01.430" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s a question that almost</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.450" end="01:16:03.020" style="s2">answers itself what do we need in an</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.430" end="01:16:06.290" style="s2">educational system we need a system that</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.020" end="01:16:07.850" style="s2">educates and it&#39;s not that hard and in</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.290" end="01:16:09.860" style="s2">the final part of your answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.850" end="01:16:13.580" style="s2">you wrapped it back into scholarship</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.860" end="01:16:16.040" style="s2">right that it&#39;s too often we have two</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.580" end="01:16:17.960" style="s2">tiers in the modern academic setting</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.040" end="01:16:20.030" style="s2">there are people who do research and are</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.960" end="01:16:22.970" style="s2">mostly freed from teaching and we have</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.820" end="01:16:44.720" style="s2">is a scenario of long telomere mice</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.560" end="01:16:46.940" style="s2">biasing drug research negated by human</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.720" end="01:16:50.060" style="s2">trials coming after if not why</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.940" end="01:16:53.390" style="s2">absolutely not the reason is because</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.060" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">when you test things on mice you are</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.390" end="01:16:59.510" style="s2">trading on the following idea that</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:02.510" style="s2">pathologies that emerge after a long</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.510" end="01:17:04.940" style="s2">term exposure to a drug will be mirrored</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.510" end="01:17:07.130" style="s2">by pathologies in a mouse if you give</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.940" end="01:17:09.950" style="s2">higher quantities of the drug you will</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.130" end="01:17:13.160" style="s2">see those pathologies early in a mouse</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.950" end="01:17:15.020" style="s2">if you then move on to human trials are</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.160" end="01:17:17.060" style="s2">you gonna follow those humans that</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.020" end="01:17:18.980" style="s2">you&#39;ve administered this drug for the</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.060" end="01:17:20.450" style="s2">next 50 years in order to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.980" end="01:17:21.890" style="s2">whether their lifespans are shortened</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.450" end="01:17:24.440" style="s2">and are you gonna hold the drug off the</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.890" end="01:17:28.130" style="s2">market for those 50 years no you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.440" end="01:17:30.710" style="s2">so in effect our system is built to use</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.130" end="01:17:32.750" style="s2">mice as a proxy for long term hazards</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.710" end="01:17:35.450" style="s2">which those mice at least in their long</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.750" end="01:17:38.420" style="s2">telomere form cannot do and then to use</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.450" end="01:17:41.300" style="s2">humans in order to discover critical</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.420" end="01:17:44.200" style="s2">short-term hazards so what I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.300" end="01:17:47.900" style="s2">repeatedly is our system is actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.200" end="01:17:50.600" style="s2">pretty good at spotting very short term</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.900" end="01:17:52.630" style="s2">critical hazards and it is very bad when</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.600" end="01:17:56.740" style="s2">it comes to long term hazards that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.630" end="01:17:59.030" style="s2">basically hidden by noise</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.740" end="01:18:00.740" style="s2">can someone address the baby-boom that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.030" end="01:18:02.930" style="s2">will was that will result from this</p>

<p begin="01:18:15.989" end="01:18:20.100" style="s2">address the baby boom will address so it</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.090" end="01:18:23.550" style="s2">will result there&#39;s a question about a</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.100" end="01:18:25.380" style="s2">baby boom the baby boom that we call the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.550" end="01:18:27.750" style="s2">baby boom happened presumably because</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.380" end="01:18:30.300" style="s2">people had held off reproducing during</p>

<p begin="01:18:35.760" end="01:18:39.750" style="s2">clear to me that that&#39;s the frame of</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.830" end="01:18:41.520" style="s2">mind that people have at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.750" end="01:18:43.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of what frame of mind</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.520" end="01:18:47.520" style="s2">they ought to have and a question of</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.350" end="01:18:49.610" style="s2">what frame of mind they do have but I am</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.520" end="01:18:51.840" style="s2">NOT I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a simple</p>

<p begin="01:18:51.840" end="01:18:57.300" style="s2">boom in the aftermath I do think we need</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.030" end="01:19:01.380" style="s2">to think about the interaction depending</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.300" end="01:19:02.850" style="s2">upon how many people are killed by this</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.380" end="01:19:05.520" style="s2">virus and how many people are</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.850" end="01:19:07.350" style="s2">compromised it predicts very different</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.350" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">crisis and it would be worth thinking</p>

<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:18.449" style="s2">how we might prepared for them his AK is</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:20.640" style="s2">52 the last one no okay</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.449" end="01:19:23.010" style="s2">54 okay all right so I&#39;m gonna go I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.640" end="01:19:24.690" style="s2">gonna go 52 up and then down to 54</p>

<p begin="01:20:44.739" end="01:20:48.340" style="s2">thank you supporting you how about a</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.150" end="01:20:50.530" style="s2">smile and hand hold it is good to see</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.340" end="01:20:53.200" style="s2">people touching since we can&#39;t so this</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.530" end="01:20:57.180" style="s2">is the third time all right Brett still</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.200" end="01:20:59.920" style="s2">reading because he&#39;s dyslexic yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.180" end="01:21:03.480" style="s2">sorry I didn&#39;t know when the hand hold</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.920" end="01:21:06.190" style="s2">was supposed to start all right okay</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.480" end="01:21:09.610" style="s2">this is all very important but where&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.190" end="01:21:12.640" style="s2">you get that lamp hell yeah I have had</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.610" end="01:21:14.739" style="s2">that lamp so long and I loved it but now</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.640" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">you all can love it and it has secrets</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.739" end="01:21:20.770" style="s2">it has yet to tell so anyway yes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:24.760" style="s2">in it I got it that lamp predates me in</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.770" end="01:21:29.710" style="s2">your life is that right yeah that lamp</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.760" end="01:21:32.170" style="s2">came from a client I believe Duncan</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.710" end="01:21:34.420" style="s2">parking meter was a client of my</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.170" end="01:21:36.220" style="s2">father&#39;s and some wonderful person at</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.420" end="01:21:39.750" style="s2">Duncan parking meter whose name I have</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.220" end="01:21:43.420" style="s2">unfortunately forgotten sent me that</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.750" end="01:21:45.489" style="s2">beautiful lamp and a genuine so that is</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.420" end="01:21:48.730" style="s2">a genuine antique parking meter and he</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.489" end="01:21:53.380" style="s2">also sent me a modern parking meter and</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.730" end="01:21:55.420" style="s2">I had one crazy afternoon I&#39;m a foreign</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.380" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">tinkerer and I took the parking meter</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.420" end="01:22:03.670" style="s2">the other one and I removed one screw</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:06.340" style="s2">and the thing blew into a million parts</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.670" end="01:22:07.810" style="s2">and boy I was sweating bullets about</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.340" end="01:22:09.700" style="s2">whether I would ever get the thing back</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.810" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">together I did get it back together at a</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.700" end="01:22:13.540" style="s2">fully functional but so where is it I</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:15.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;ve been wondering that at</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.540" end="01:22:17.500" style="s2">what point did that one disappear I feel</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.280" end="01:22:19.690" style="s2">like I met that one too but I don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.500" end="01:22:21.190" style="s2">been a lot it&#39;s been many moves I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.690" end="01:22:22.420" style="s2">say that I&#39;m pleased that this one has</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.190" end="01:22:25.270" style="s2">survived everything we&#39;ve been through</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.420" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">and is now making its debut on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.270" end="01:22:27.910" style="s2">Internet</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.840" end="01:22:29.260" style="s2">was it in the vehicle that burned up</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.910" end="01:22:29.830" style="s2">with everything else we owned inside of</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.260" end="01:22:31.660" style="s2">it it could</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.830" end="01:22:33.460" style="s2">being yeah okay that&#39;s probably actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.660" end="01:22:35.020" style="s2">what happened to it yeah no I was</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.460" end="01:22:35.890" style="s2">talking about this one no this one was</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.020" end="01:22:37.960" style="s2">not okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.890" end="01:22:41.470" style="s2">okay so scroll down we&#39;re done with this</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.960" end="01:22:46.000" style="s2">page I think all right we have a couple</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.470" end="01:22:46.900" style="s2">more two more looks like hold on two</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.000" end="01:22:48.670" style="s2">more questions</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.900" end="01:22:55.180" style="s2">can we develop herd immunity against</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.670" end="01:22:58.450" style="s2">kovat 19 probably we should not be</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.180" end="01:23:03.190" style="s2">trying to do that yet the longer it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.450" end="01:23:06.220" style="s2">before vast numbers of people get it the</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.190" end="01:23:08.850" style="s2">more likely the virus and we will have</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.220" end="01:23:12.550" style="s2">evolved a more stable relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.850" end="01:23:14.770" style="s2">more likely yet is the likelier we are</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.550" end="01:23:16.240" style="s2">as humans to have developed effective</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.770" end="01:23:17.980" style="s2">medications to have understood what the</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.240" end="01:23:19.270" style="s2">mechanisms of action are to therefore</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.980" end="01:23:21.460" style="s2">know for instance what to do with</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.270" end="01:23:24.040" style="s2">ventilators and when maybe to have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.460" end="01:23:27.660" style="s2">vaccine all of these things so yes herd</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.040" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">immunity is hopefully a long-term answer</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.660" end="01:23:31.300" style="s2">but that does not mean that we should</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:32.800" style="s2">try to accelerate that process that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.300" end="01:23:35.440" style="s2">would be dangerous yeah I think we are</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.800" end="01:23:37.300" style="s2">developing it but yeah the problem is it</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.440" end="01:23:40.600" style="s2">comes at a very high cost at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.300" end="01:23:43.360" style="s2">so anyway some of us you know we may be</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.600" end="01:23:46.450" style="s2">immune as a result of you having it and</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.360" end="01:23:49.750" style="s2">I may be having it yes mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.450" end="01:23:52.120" style="s2">okay final question what do you see</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.750" end="01:23:53.650" style="s2">happening to evergreen I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.120" end="01:23:56.260" style="s2">that question means to what do we see</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.650" end="01:23:57.970" style="s2">happening at the moment is there you</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.260" end="01:24:03.760" style="s2">know there was a state of the college</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.970" end="01:24:06.550" style="s2">address in which the person in charge of</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.760" end="01:24:09.690" style="s2">the financial disclosure said they had</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.550" end="01:24:13.030" style="s2">about two years of reserves he then says</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.690" end="01:24:14.290" style="s2">recently yeah John Carmichael number two</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.030" end="01:24:16.150" style="s2">Carmichael yes I do</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.290" end="01:24:18.460" style="s2">yeah well John Carmichael said they had</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.150" end="01:24:22.150" style="s2">about two years left at the current burn</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.460" end="01:24:24.160" style="s2">rate before they would go under he then</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.150" end="01:24:31.140" style="s2">gave a couple of reasons that he was</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.160" end="01:24:31.140" style="s2">hopeful the reasons were nonsense which</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.230" end="01:24:36.550" style="s2">sounds like him too so anyway I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.630" end="01:24:40.030" style="s2">evergreen is in dire circumstances this</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.550" end="01:24:41.860" style="s2">was before now it was actually during</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.030" end="01:24:43.510" style="s2">the early part of the epidemic so I</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.860" end="01:24:44.890" style="s2">think what may have happened</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.510" end="01:24:46.480" style="s2">but the Board of Trustee is a scheduled</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.890" end="01:24:48.790" style="s2">of meeting which is widely thought to</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.480" end="01:24:52.270" style="s2">maybe be about declaring bankruptcy</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.790" end="01:24:54.580" style="s2">because many many small colleges</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.270" end="01:24:56.620" style="s2">I mean Evergreen is unique in being a I</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.580" end="01:24:58.510" style="s2">think unique at least very unusual in</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.620" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">being a public liberal arts college most</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.510" end="01:25:03.250" style="s2">liberal arts colleges are private and</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:06.910" style="s2">therefore have a larger amount of money</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.250" end="01:25:10.090" style="s2">to depend on being public and liberal</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.910" end="01:25:12.310" style="s2">arts puts it a particular risk pulling</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.090" end="01:25:14.890" style="s2">the shenanigans to put it lightly that</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.310" end="01:25:17.980" style="s2">it pulled in 2017 puts it at great risk</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.890" end="01:25:22.060" style="s2">and then the fact that kovat 19 is</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.980" end="01:25:23.440" style="s2">creating financial straits for a Crosse</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.060" end="01:25:26.980" style="s2">higher ed across institutions of higher</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.440" end="01:25:28.870" style="s2">ed means that this may well be the straw</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.980" end="01:25:31.060" style="s2">well I think you I think it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.870" end="01:25:34.330" style="s2">certain to kill the college the problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.060" end="01:25:36.160" style="s2">from my perspective is that in order for</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.330" end="01:25:38.590" style="s2">the world to get smarter the</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.160" end="01:25:42.040" style="s2">consequences have to flow to the people</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.590" end="01:25:44.680" style="s2">who screwed up you know too big to fail</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.040" end="01:25:47.500" style="s2">is a reasonable argument because</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.680" end="01:25:49.060" style="s2">institutions that are of a particular</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.500" end="01:25:51.460" style="s2">nature when they fail hurt a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.060" end="01:25:52.360" style="s2">innocent people but the people who steer</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.460" end="01:25:54.250" style="s2">them into danger</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.360" end="01:25:56.890" style="s2">should never be covered by too big to</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.250" end="01:25:59.020" style="s2">fail in the case of Evergreen they bent</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.890" end="01:26:02.020" style="s2">over backwards year after year to</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.020" end="01:26:04.330" style="s2">preserve George bridges reputation why</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.020" end="01:26:06.610" style="s2">he came there he made terrible decisions</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.330" end="01:26:08.410" style="s2">they came back to haunt us absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.610" end="01:26:13.180" style="s2">immediately would it had been so</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.410" end="01:26:15.640" style="s2">terrible to say we do not have any</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.180" end="01:26:17.950" style="s2">confidence in this man&#39;s leadership we</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.640" end="01:26:19.660" style="s2">wish him well and to move on no they</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.950" end="01:26:22.210" style="s2">kept him on board through the end of his</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.660" end="01:26:24.280" style="s2">contract gave him some kind of bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.210" end="01:26:26.560" style="s2">statement about his wisdom and courage</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.280" end="01:26:29.590" style="s2">in the face of everything that he saw</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.560" end="01:26:33.660" style="s2">and they sent him on his way I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.590" end="01:26:35.620" style="s2">still in he&#39;s still there but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.660" end="01:26:36.970" style="s2">through the end of the academic year at</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.620" end="01:26:38.710" style="s2">which point they&#39;re gonna take him on as</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.970" end="01:26:40.390" style="s2">a teacher as their furloughing other</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.710" end="01:26:44.320" style="s2">people so that is in and of itself</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.390" end="01:26:46.060" style="s2">insane but now the pandemic is going to</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.320" end="01:26:48.610" style="s2">give them cover and they&#39;re gonna claim</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.060" end="01:26:50.620" style="s2">that the college failed because you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.610" end="01:26:52.570" style="s2">there was a long term trend where they</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.620" end="01:26:54.250" style="s2">were losing students which yes was true</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.570" end="01:26:55.989" style="s2">but that long-term trend had nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.250" end="01:26:57.099" style="s2">do with the cliff they hit as a result</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.989" end="01:26:59.800" style="s2">of bridges</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.099" end="01:27:02.590" style="s2">herbal management of the place so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.800" end="01:27:04.389" style="s2">get us started like this yes this we do</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.590" end="01:27:06.429" style="s2">want drinks in front of us for right</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.389" end="01:27:08.229" style="s2">we&#39;ll get brutally honest and it is five</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.429" end="01:27:09.789" style="s2">o&#39;clock somewhere oh I&#39;m sure it is in</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.229" end="01:27:11.590" style="s2">fact it&#39;s even five o&#39;clock it&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.789" end="01:27:14.109" style="s2">o&#39;clock here yeah okay we hit one more</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.590" end="01:27:16.570" style="s2">question and then and then we&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.109" end="01:27:18.879" style="s2">okay - potentially fatal viruses that</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.570" end="01:27:22.570" style="s2">become endemic and populations who gain</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.879" end="01:27:24.249" style="s2">near immunity or compatibility act as</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.570" end="01:27:26.229" style="s2">unintentional bioweapons for that</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.249" end="01:27:29.229" style="s2">population which attack potential</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.229" end="01:27:31.359" style="s2">adversaries Guns Germs and Steel is that</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.229" end="01:27:34.239" style="s2">story in spades yes</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.359" end="01:27:38.079" style="s2">the fact is when the conquistadors came</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.239" end="01:27:39.849" style="s2">to the new world they wielded smallpox</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.079" end="01:27:42.070" style="s2">without even knowing that they were</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.849" end="01:27:43.269" style="s2">doing it yeah that their guns knowing</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.070" end="01:27:45.760" style="s2">full well what they were doing and</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.269" end="01:27:47.590" style="s2">wielded smallpox unintentionally and in</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.760" end="01:27:51.010" style="s2">many ways smallpox was the far more</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.590" end="01:27:53.260" style="s2">effective killer and what&#39;s more if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.010" end="01:27:55.780" style="s2">think about what happened next well I</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.260" end="01:27:57.729" style="s2">should let me say they real did smallpox</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.780" end="01:28:00.489" style="s2">unintentionally at first later they used</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.729" end="01:28:03.269" style="s2">it as a bio weapon I think those stories</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.489" end="01:28:06.519" style="s2">are apocryphal okay um they may have</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.269" end="01:28:08.229" style="s2">wielded smallpox as a bioweapon by</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.519" end="01:28:10.419" style="s2">giving small box infected blankets to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.229" end="01:28:12.459" style="s2">I think that story is a part I just said</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.419" end="01:28:15.399" style="s2">that I&#39;m saying they may have I know</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.459" end="01:28:17.699" style="s2">but okay so anyway I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.399" end="01:28:22.359" style="s2">that necessarily had to happen but</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.699" end="01:28:25.059" style="s2">smallpox did some much of the heavy</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.359" end="01:28:30.070" style="s2">lifting of conquering the new world and</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.059" end="01:28:31.929" style="s2">then the Spanish looted it and how much</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.070" end="01:28:35.320" style="s2">gold ended up in Europe that was</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.929" end="01:28:36.969" style="s2">actually a new world gold and what</p>
