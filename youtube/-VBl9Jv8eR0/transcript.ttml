<p begin="00:00:07.040" end="00:00:12.160" style="s2">with my friend and colleague jp marceau</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.760" end="00:00:14.559" style="s2">uh jp and i have had a series of very</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:15.519" style="s2">uh engaging and enriching uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.559" end="00:00:17.119" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.519" end="00:00:19.039" style="s2">uh jp why don&#39;t you just reintroduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:19.680" style="s2">yourself a bit and then let&#39;s launch us</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:27.920" style="s2">um yeah i have a background in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:31.039" style="s2">philosophy because i was interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.920" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">in solving let&#39;s say my own sliver of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.039" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">the the meaning crisis how it appeared</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">to me and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">my philosophical studies allowed me to</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">try and address this</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:41.680" style="s2">i especially became uh familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:43.040" style="s2">pancychism as a way to address one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.680" end="00:00:43.600" style="s2">the aspects of the knee crisis sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.040" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.600" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">the idea that maybe i&#39;m just matter or</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">that my consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">somehow disconnected from my body and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">over the course of becoming aware of uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">jordan peterson&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">jonathan&#39;s work your work eventually was</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:00:59.440" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">get in touch with you and have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.440" end="00:01:03.440" style="s2">dialogue more precisely about psychism</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:06.479" style="s2">and something interesting happened in</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.440" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">there where it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.479" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">let&#39;s see the reasons why i was trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">to use that psychism to address my</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">sliver of limiting crisis you were also</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2">able to address</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">with your non-reductive uh physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">and some of the the the points some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">the problems are really mirrored there</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:23.439" style="s2">so in psychism</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">the the problem of the one in the many</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.439" end="00:01:25.759" style="s2">shows up really clearly in passangism</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.759" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">you know how is it that different</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">consciousnesses can somehow combine</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">climate and psychism if consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:34.240" style="s2">goes all the way all the way down and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the reason why we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.240" end="00:01:36.799" style="s2">consciousnesses</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">then you need to explain how it is at</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.799" end="00:01:40.240" style="s2">those smaller consciousnesses my</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">my cells are atoms so how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.240" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">they can combine</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">yeah yeah and i was to use some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">bergsonian uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">uh ideas to get uh get clear with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">bergson was very influenced from</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">neoplatonism so on the other end when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:56.880" style="s2">with you and it turned out that your</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">with your non-reductive physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.880" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">you make use of neoplatonic ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">explain what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">the same basic idea of the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:05.600" style="s2">the one in domain doesn&#39;t show up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">terms of consciousness itself but still</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.600" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">you have the problem of how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">some abstract patterns some</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">unify the entities some some formal</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.400" style="s2">structures can interact with their</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.239" style="s2">constituents in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">allows them to be at the same time one</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.239" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">and many</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:20.800" style="s2">so we have sort of parallel sets of of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">concerns and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.800" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">throughout uh the last year really</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">because it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">just a bit over a year i think since we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">last spoke i</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">i&#39;ve been more and more exploring this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">idea of emergency elimination and to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">how much i can get</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">from a more standard naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">ontology</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:43.360" style="s2">without without having to go full-blown</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">psychism uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.360" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">already and this this led us especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">uh to converge on the thought of a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">platonic christian thinkers such as john</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">scottish regina and also saint maximus</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">the confessor</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">yep and really over the the course of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">the just the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">few months i&#39;ve been rereading some uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">authors that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:04.959" style="s2">i had read more in depth a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:09.680" style="s2">such as saint thomas</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.959" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">aquinas and was able to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">this basic pattern of emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">elimination</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">in aquinas as well and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">what i was interested to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">today in our discussion was</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">some of the the reasons why this</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">this this dialectical worldview between</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">emergency animation was</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">was not clearer to me or to people in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">general whereas i think you can find it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.920" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">in aquinas or</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">even to go further back um jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">pedro&#39;s brother</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">matthew wrote the book the language of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">creation uh commentary on the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">on basically on genesis and he makes</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">quite clear in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">this book although it wasn&#39;t clear at</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">the time when i read it two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">when i reread it now knowing what i know</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">now about emergency</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">nation although matthew uses different</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">it&#39;s clear to me that you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">pattern between images and lamination uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">right away from the start of genesis in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">the beginning god created the events</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">the forms from which uh structures are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:13.040" style="s2">made and created the earth which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">which was without form and void so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.040" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">that&#39;s just the potential from which</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:19.040" style="s2">things will emerge</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">yeah so this was surprising for me to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.040" end="00:04:24.800" style="s2">see this uh recently and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">i was interested to see so not only how</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.800" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">is it that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">this dialectical view of emergency</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">nation</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">was became let&#39;s say unclear to us today</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">and i was thinking that it probably has</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">to do with the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">across people or across thinkers as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">we have become it&#39;s not only that our</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">world view has become let&#39;s see flatter</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.840" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">where we have a harder time thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">how different layers and track together</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">but one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">older traditions were able to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">richer ontologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">such as you find in aquinas or also in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">the uh in israel was that they also had</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">much more dialectical view of society in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">general or of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">roles so the best philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">tended to be priests people were</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">actually in contact with a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">they were able to sort of abstract from</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">the lives of all the parishioners</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">and they also had to mediate between</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:18.479" style="s2">them and higher levels uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">in in the hierarchy so they were living</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.479" end="00:05:21.360" style="s2">the metaphysics that they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">lay out in books</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.360" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">yeah and i think that our loss of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:29.039" style="s2">is really paralleled by our loss of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.039" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">our uh tactical relationships in general</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s wow that&#39;s really</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">anthology called internet or dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.120" style="s2">uh with christopher master pietro we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">editing it contributing to</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:06:01.680" style="s2">contributing to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.759" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">uh we have people uh from many spots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.680" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">what</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">internet she&#39;s interested too</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">all these people involved with these</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">emerging practices and all this dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">um and and what</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">and what chris and i are exploring is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">um the effort by many of these like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">circling communities</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">uh the evolved community right uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">all of these new biological communities</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">um and even uh other communities like</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">great kelly that incorporate a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">dialogical component to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">all these all these practices all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">biological practices are an emergence</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">so what we&#39;re trying to do is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">figure out what is going on there</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing and then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">what really what sparked my interest in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">this was</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">a couple things i had a discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">jordan hall and he talked about the need</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:07:00.479" style="s2">a meta psycho technology uh that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">curates and coordinates the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.479" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">practices then i realized</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">for the ancient world that was dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:06.960" style="s2">so i&#39;ve engaged in the long project of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.840" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.960" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">reverse engineer what dialectic is as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s lots of stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.240" style="s2">lots of videos about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">the book is coming out anyways where</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">that is leading me</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">is uh into</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">a lot of the the the ideas that you just</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:25.919" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">one is the idea that dialectic always</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.919" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">had a horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">and a vertical aspect to it there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">horizontal aspect</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">in which you and i you and i are both</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">engaged in projects of individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">particip</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">and participation right uh because and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:43.759" style="s2">every human being is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">until i talked about that and young has</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.759" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">a similar kind of notion</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">that we&#39;re locked into this this tone us</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">this creative tension</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">uh between individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">participation and then what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">in that right is that there is often</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.599" end="00:08:01.360" style="s2">us and emergent logos and like you and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">and this is this is one of the for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.360" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">one of this is one of the features of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">media logos uh i prefer to use the greek</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">rather than the modern term</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">um uh in in contrast to normal debate</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">or even conversation is that you and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">together can get to a place we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">get to on our own yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s exactly the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.680" style="s2">terminology that you can you can find in</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not the exact same terminology but</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:27.199" style="s2">the same idea that you can find in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">areas that are popping up right now so</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.199" end="00:08:33.039" style="s2">let&#39;s say the in the the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:34.159" style="s2">notion in modern philosophy of minor</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.039" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">cognitive science you did</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.159" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">when a new system has properties</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">that you cannot reduce to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">constituents then you have a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">emergent</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">uh system that is not reducible or if</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:47.040" style="s2">you you take the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">the older uh notion of form from</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.040" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">aristotle or aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">well a a form it is substantial form</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">in opposition to a mere accidental</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">aggregate of things a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">substantial form is a pattern that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">cannot produce</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">to its four constituents it has</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">attributes that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">it has new causal powers that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">find at lower levels</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s exactly right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this notion of emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">new logos</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">right new properties new patterns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s because it&#39;s an inhib it has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">formal cause</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">which i interpret dynamically to mean a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">system is self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">as you said not a mere aggregation or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:24.560" style="s2">heap it&#39;s self-organizing and especially</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">it&#39;s self-organizing in</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.560" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">some way that&#39;s self-perpetuating and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">self-preserving and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">right and so the idea is there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:36.120" style="s2">horizontal dimension</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">but that is always in connection with it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.120" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">exemplifies</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">and is informed by the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">dimension because</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">as you and i in dial in dialectic we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">just getting an intimacy with each other</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.480" style="s2">and i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:52.640" style="s2">right as a kind of intimacy of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.480" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">intellection and intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.640" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">as we do that we also get an intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:59.760" style="s2">with that very process of</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.760" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">emerging and what that takes us into is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">is that intelligibility is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">something that as you said</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">that is level that is moving between</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">emergence right and in the dialogue you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:14.959" style="s2">and i will have as you said something</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">emerged</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">with the insight but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:22.399" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">when you&#39;re engaged in the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.399" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">dialogue there&#39;s also a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">emanation</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">because you don&#39;t you you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">arbitrarily saying things</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">there right there&#39;s a sense of right</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">that we&#39;re uncovering the structures of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">intelligibility the very structures by</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.519" style="s2">which we can make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re ahead of us in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.519" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">way yeah there&#39;s like meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">constraints</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">above us that no tell us where we could</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">take the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">and we can sort of just select between</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">them that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">so you start to in the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">between the individuation and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:56.040" style="s2">participation</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.279" style="s2">you also start to find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.040" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">exemplifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.279" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">the vertical move right between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">and the emanation you start to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">a process of anagarge</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">so as you and i reciprocally open</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">horizontally there&#39;s also a reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.760" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">vertically and and so dialectic becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">a profound act by which we</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">simultaneously realize our humanity</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:24.240" style="s2">making each other more persons</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.880" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">right because we&#39;re realizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.240" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">actualizing our our personhood</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:29.680" style="s2">but but but we&#39;re also realizing you</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.680" end="00:11:33.200" style="s2">what what what what undergirds all</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">realness those patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.200" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">intelligibility those layers</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">of relationship between emergence</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">and emanation so you and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence i</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:45.279" style="s2">mentioned you this earlier before we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">just started filming</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.560" style="s2">find you know erigina writing in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">dialogue fashion</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.560" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">and thomas aquinas in the summer writing</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">in a dialogical fashion i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:00.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s just a mere sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">pleasantry or ornamentation</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.480" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">i think they&#39;re trying to exemplify in</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">the form</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">because they&#39;re aware of formal cause</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">in the form of the dialogue right the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not just talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">they&#39;re exemplifying and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:20.959" style="s2">and what they&#39;re trying to do is make</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">the pattern of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.959" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">co-presentation of ideas are fine to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">be offended like have an affinity to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">know the very pattern by which</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">reality is presence in between emanation</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">and emergence and i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">profound realization when you do some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">these practices</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">right like the practice the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">logos or sense uh guys send stocks uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">circling practice</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">everybody gets this sense of this uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">third factor</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s a between it</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t mean this disrespectful you</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">know i don&#39;t mean that you know jesus</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">where two or three are gathered in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">name there i am also when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">these practices</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">everybody gets a sense of the we space</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked to you this before</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">that somehow beyond so the between</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">also immediately makes people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">phenomenologically aware</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:13.360" style="s2">of the above and beyond and so those two</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">dimensions i&#39;ve talked about them</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.360" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">abstractly but when it happens</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not an abstract experience it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">palpable</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">sense presence that is profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">enriching and transformative to people</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">so this whole project of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">uh i think is actually very very central</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">and so i think the degree to which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">lost the practice of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">we have lost access to the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">and vertical dimensions and then that as</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">you already argued i thought very</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">astutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">that truncates our metaphysics in a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">that really hamstrings us</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">and helps drive the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s what i would argue that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">would propose to you yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:02.880" style="s2">i i think one aspect of it is when we we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">talk about it&#39;s the vertical</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.880" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">aspects of dialectic the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:11.839" style="s2">aquinas for instance was writing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">metaphysical books</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.839" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">uh where as you brightly point out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">the suma is written as a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">between its</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">objections and responses but you know in</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">in his vocation aquinas was also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">priest where his job was to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">a mediator between a cosmic dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">he he has to listen to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">confessions yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">yeah yeah he listens you can sit as</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">he gathers the potential of his parish</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.880" style="s2">and of his students</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">so people freedoms of uh refined</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.880" end="00:14:46.639" style="s2">information and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">he has to bring it all up into himself</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.639" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">and try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">make it fit within uh christianity</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:52.800" style="s2">within it</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah with it within something</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.800" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">super abstract something invisible</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">within evan you know the realm of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">invisibles virtual reality and</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">aquinas has to mediate between</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">all of those and i think that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">the mess that we see in in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">starting</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">starting probably with modernity is in</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">large part due to the fact that people</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">stopped doing this dialectic uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">with other people also across people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:24.959" style="s2">so for instance it&#39;s it this was really</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">striking to me when i</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.959" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">did uh when i was in grad school in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:30.880" style="s2">philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.639" style="s2">taking different seminars let&#39;s see you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.880" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">take a seminar in analytic philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.639" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">a seminar in phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">and you can clearly see that this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:39.199" style="s2">just the thing about let&#39;s see some</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">people think that phenomology is better</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.199" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">and some people think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">analytics philosophy of mind is better</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">like people at different personalities</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:47.839" style="s2">you can tell that they were largely</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">influenced by the way they interact with</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.839" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">and so this the loss of a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">between people in the academia and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:57.519" style="s2">loss of directing between the people of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">the academy and the real people like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.519" end="00:16:00.560" style="s2">people in the pew</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.720" end="00:16:02.160" style="s2">this this loss of dialectic that</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.560" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">connected people and that allowed them</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.160" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">to reach a ir dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">is what has led to the huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">fragmentation that we see today in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:10.160" style="s2">philosophy departments or between</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.320" style="s2">departments in the university as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.160" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">where if you talk to someone in</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.320" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">literature or someone in physics they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.120" style="s2">have wildly different cultures whereas</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the time if you went back to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.120" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">a time when</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:20.880" style="s2">people had more meta unified metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">or when the uni</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.880" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">the university was more unified and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">really concerns me because i</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how we can recover this</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:33.680" style="s2">better centered metaphysics nowadays i</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">think that&#39;s right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.680" end="00:16:37.120" style="s2">i mean yeah there&#39;s several problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">there one one is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.120" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">the problem that i&#39;m trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">with a bunch of people which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:47.680" style="s2">can we bring back simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">the practice of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.680" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">and situated home it within</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">a world view that legitimates it and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">valorizes it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">um but then there&#39;s and i&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">that in more in a sec but then</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to forget the other point</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.839" style="s2">you made but there&#39;s also you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">there&#39;s also a social institutional</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.839" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">about how we&#39;ve separated the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">uh right from the university</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">and that has led to what you i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">you&#39;re discussing here</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">so let&#39;s not lose that point but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">come back to the first point</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:21.919" style="s2">um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">that point you made about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.919" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">uh especially people who had a a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:29.840" style="s2">mediating function</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">um it&#39;s also very very um</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">apropos because if you look to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">father of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">socrates um he sees himself</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:41.280" style="s2">as always mataksu always in always</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">mediating</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.280" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">uh between right um always between</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">uh the divine and the human and even</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">sees eros</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">as something that is uh between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">divine and the human</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">uh and so that the sense of uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">of being something that inherently</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">mediates</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">between what emerges and what&#39;s emanate</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">is is very very pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">uh in socrates uh and then it gets</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">carried through and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">developed you know very extensively</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">as you know in the neoplatonic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">yeah and so even you know within my</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">tradition within the jewel christian</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">yep you you have you have prophets or</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">you know you have priests you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">people who mediate between</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">uh the people and god they&#39;re never just</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">like trying to bring the people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.400" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re always trying to turn</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">the people ultimately to god to the our</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.400" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">story even christ</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">when he comes down he says that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">always just trying to get people to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">father like it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">himself it&#39;s not about just him</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">gathering people or him having something</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:46.080" style="s2">below him fit well it&#39;s always about</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:47.039" style="s2">mediating between creation and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">creator</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.039" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">right right but also exemplifying so</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.400" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">right he&#39;s gathering people the logos</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">into like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:19:00.160" style="s2">the emergence of the of the church right</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">very much but but he&#39;s also uh he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.160" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">exemplifying right yeah he&#39;s emanating</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">right uh he&#39;s emanating i i</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:10.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t again i&#39;m worried that i&#39;m well</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">you and i know each other you know that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.720" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s in some sense he&#39;s emanating</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">god and that sounds like a heresy but</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">you know the language i&#39;m trying well</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:19.039" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">we can just say that he&#39;s emanating the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.039" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">father yes that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">yeah so what what what</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">what what i think happens though is</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.960" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.039" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a historical issue i think you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.960" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">get the shift</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">right uh from the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">to the to the treatise and you get the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:45.280" style="s2">to non-transformational purely</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">propositional thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.280" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">and you get figures like akam and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">forth um</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">and you get nominalism which</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">some at the same time removes the sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">of there being these layers and these</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">and then you get the rise of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:03.919" style="s2">of monolithic</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">isolated individual mind removed like so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.919" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">in the ecclesia you really have a a</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to be too anatomistic here</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">you have something like an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">of distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">that most of our cognition is done in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">embodied fashion in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">embedded</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">that we that most of our</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what the cognitive science is now</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">showing that our cognition is</p>

<p begin="00:20:48.159" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">has been very very disastrous uh it</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">actually has cut us off</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">and the cog side i would argue is now</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:59.039" style="s2">returning us</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">um to the view of the importance of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:04.880" style="s2">and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.640" style="s2">you you&#39;ve already alluded to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.880" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">starting to return us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.640" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">right the vertical because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.240" end="00:21:12.720" style="s2">reminding us uh that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">are well at least the the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">i i practice this discussion uh</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:36.400" style="s2">time i think when they&#39;re most</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.880" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">culturally needed</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.400" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">what that means back now to the second</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">point sorry i&#39;m talking so much today</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">but the second point about what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:47.039" style="s2">institution will look like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">what i see happening is i&#39;ve seen these</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.039" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">new emerging</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">ecologies and practices that i&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">to like conferences like</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">the movement summit and i&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">panel and talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">and again no disrespect but they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">be trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">between the separate functions of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">and the monastery these communities are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">are schooling people like the academy</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">but they&#39;re also demanding but and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">affording</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">self-transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">self-transcendence and community</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:17.600" style="s2">like the monastery like when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">what rafe is doing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s i said this to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">he&#39;s telling me about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">things and i said</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:24.799" style="s2">you know ray if you&#39;re actually building</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:25.760" style="s2">a church and he laughed he sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.799" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">acknowledged that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.760" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">going on there</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">and so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">perhaps i&#39;m trying to be very cautious</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">here this emerging</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">cognitive science understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">horizontal and vertical dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">that are realized india logos</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">is coming more and more into contact</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">with maybe i&#39;m a mediator</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">i just thought about that that&#39;s a joke</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">coming in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">these emerging communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">institutions or communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:02.640" style="s2">or beyond the division of the school and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:04.240" style="s2">the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.640" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">but they sometimes call themselves even</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.240" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">secular monasteries or this school or</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">that school</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s what i see happening</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">sorry that was a lot but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">you you keep saying very pregnant things</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s good i i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">try and bring something related i have</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:23.440" style="s2">never</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">sort of tried to think about the history</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.440" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">last time in our last discussion we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:30.640" style="s2">talked about the idea of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">spreading through deaths and reverts</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.640" end="00:23:34.720" style="s2">and i have never tried to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">explicitly in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.720" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">dialectic i&#39;ve tried to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.240" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">in related terms and i think maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">could help us</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">in this discussion right now but</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">what seems to have happened is uh okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">we talked about metaphysics going awry</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">in the west</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">we talk also about how the surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">uh went awry uh also and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">i i i i&#39;ve been playing with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">see this as a within a an even broader</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">historical dialectic maybe of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">okay so in as i i alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">you can see already in the hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">scriptures this dialectical worldview</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">going on between heaven and earth</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">between the forms</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">the invisible and the the matter the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">jacob&#39;s ladder yeah you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">already see this in in the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">fairly clearly i think especially in</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">matthew</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:27.520" style="s2">matthews book i think it like gives so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:28.480" style="s2">many examples that it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.520" end="00:24:31.679" style="s2">overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.480" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">um and then when</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">judaism will become christianity later</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">it will spread both east and west</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">and what seems to have happened as it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.480" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">spread especially in the east or let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">say in atlantic culture</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:46.240" style="s2">it includes rome at the time you had a</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:48.159" style="s2">culture where</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.240" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">people were largely platonists</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.159" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">especially uh in the intelligentsia</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">people were or in general the illinois</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">philosophers were</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">used to see the world in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">emanation the they didn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">so much about the the matter they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">think that god created matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">uh the potential they thought that god</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">lets it be a mover or the form of forms</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:11.039" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:11.520" style="s2">the one that from this this form from</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.039" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.520" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">this set of constraints from this source</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">of constraints we can even say</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">uh shapes will come to uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">give order to the the potential of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">matter so you have this top-down view of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">whereas with uh so so when christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">spreads</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">in the east in illinois culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">the challenge will be to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">see that but marketing as well because</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">there&#39;s yeah that god created</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">matter as well and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">genuine there&#39;s genuine emergence so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">challenge was to sort of get the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:42.720" style="s2">the greeks and the romans to care about</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">the body uh at least the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.720" end="00:25:46.480" style="s2">so the kind of resistance that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">see is a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.480" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">errors is where people sort of have this</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">name for matter or uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">you have origin who has word theories</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">about matter or about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:59.520" style="s2">sometimes maybe the body being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:01.279" style="s2">this it&#39;s sorry maybe you can sit as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.520" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">as a soldier of down source of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.279" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">everything yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:07.200" style="s2">and what happened in the west uh is sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">of the opposite you had like germanic</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.200" end="00:26:12.799" style="s2">tribes were fairly materialistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:14.720" style="s2">and i um there&#39;s i think it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.799" end="00:26:17.039" style="s2">his name is gibson right now i read a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">book from a an author</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.039" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">brett saw called which uh paul directly</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:22.720" style="s2">out on his channel yet good</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.720" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">he wrote a book on the history of trans</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:29.679" style="s2">substantiation uh yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">yes and he references a in the book he</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.679" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">references an author</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">whose name escapes me uh it&#39;s a catholic</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:37.039" style="s2">theologian</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">who makes the point that the germanic</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">were fairly materialistic not only</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">you can sit sometimes in roman documents</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">like the romans will uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">sort of mock the the germanic tries</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:50.159" style="s2">because they they venerate</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">visible things like they&#39;re not able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.159" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">abstract as much to the invisible</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">and also there&#39;s also the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.120" end="00:26:58.159" style="s2">because they were always warring with</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">one another tended to make them more</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.159" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">and to sort of make them really</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:06.559" style="s2">down-to-earth people right so</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">what happens as a christianity spreads</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.559" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">uh in europe and the european tribes</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:12.799" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">uh converted and have now</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.799" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">they were fine with seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:17.840" style="s2">bottom up seeing like concrete things</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">uh but they have to start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.840" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">god created the evans as well like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">god is behind both heaven and earth that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">is beyond</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">emergence and elimination and now the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">the source of eresis that you&#39;ll see is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">that they stand to see the world just</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">so already in like the 8th or 9th</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">century when</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">you not only have romans doing theology</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">there but when</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">especially like the germanic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">start doing their own philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">anthology you can start to see rscs</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">people will only see the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">aspect of things and they sort of make</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">more and more receiving the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">emanation from evan</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">right and so in the case of uh of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">eucharist you start to see disputes</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">about people saying that well</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.360" style="s2">either it means that the eucharist is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:03.679" style="s2">like in</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.360" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">even in the accidents is flesh and flesh</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.679" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">and blood just like my flesh and blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">like the same flesh and blood that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">or you&#39;ll start to see people doing well</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:13.760" style="s2">then it means that it&#39;s just a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">and symbol in sort of the the pederative</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.760" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just a symbol so i think what has</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.960" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">happened is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">okay so you had like within the judo</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">christian culture especially from</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">like the early hebrew heritage you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">a worldview where both emergent</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:30.399" style="s2">animation work really well</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">in the in the in the east when julia</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.399" end="00:28:33.679" style="s2">christianity its</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">calendar culture now the challenge is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.679" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">see the apartment thing as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">but when it moves west the challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">to see that top down as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">and i think that what has happened</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">no throughout the years throughout</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">modernity the west</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">by seeing the world uh bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">and you know making a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">theological errors but because</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.200" style="s2">the uh which is it maybe that the church</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">or the judeo-christian worldview</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.200" end="00:29:00.320" style="s2">because it still improved upon what was</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">already there</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.320" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">uh it sort of gave power to the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">the bottom-up worldview of the germanic</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">tribes and led to science and it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">just compounded because you were</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:13.039" style="s2">seeing real successes by seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">world only bottom up but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.039" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">recently started to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">to fragment this worldview we realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">that if you only try to see things</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">bottom up you hit like tons of problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">that you&#39;ve seen in foster field even</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.039" style="s2">just chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear how you can explain the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.039" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">emergence really</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">of chemical compounds that have</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">properties that you don&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.200" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">able to reduce to their individual</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">components or</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:34.880" style="s2">same thing that happens with life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:35.440" style="s2">huge problem with consciousness if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.880" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.440" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">like genuine emergence if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:41.120" style="s2">genuine forms that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">will then emanate down to to the matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.120" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">it you can&#39;t really explain</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">consciousness either</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">so overall i said that in my more</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:50.480" style="s2">optimistic days i see that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">is i don&#39;t try to just some people when</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.480" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">they see that okay christianity went</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">wrong there or went from there they</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">tried to</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">sort of respond respond as a reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:00.399" style="s2">then then let&#39;s just roll back to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">last thing that worked and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.399" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">let&#39;s stay there</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">you can see this in protestants or even</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">some uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">some like traditional catholics or</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">orthodox they just oh if we just go back</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">to the church fathers or if you just go</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">back to aquarius and everything will be</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">but i more tend to think that like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">all part of one story where</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">this see this world view where emerges</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">and mentioned were</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">meeting well in the judo christian</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">tradition like as it spreads east</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">it has a certain dielectric to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">through until it reaches a more stable</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">point and same thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">in in the west where you still have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">go through like cycles of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">of dialectic to get people to see the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:35.919" style="s2">top down in the bottom up as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">do you think that helps yeah wait i like</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.919" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">this i think this is a really brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">idea a new way of uh a new schema for</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">uh the history of christianity i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">so let me make sure i get you that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">and you started top down but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.960" style="s2">you also alluded bottom up which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">well done by the way uh so</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.960" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">but let me so i might be presenting in</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:01.679" style="s2">reverse order the way you present it but</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">this is your way uh making you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.679" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">like both east and west have a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:08.799" style="s2">between bottom down and top</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">uh between bottom up and top down right</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.799" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">between emergence and emanation</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">but the but nevertheless overall the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">east tends to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:17.679" style="s2">emanation and the west can stand precise</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.679" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">and so there&#39;s also a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">dialect between the east and west</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:25.760" style="s2">it is very fruitful right now it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">saying that right now the dialogues are</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.760" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">really cool like</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">happening between the catholics and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">orthodox or doing the protestants and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">the catholics and the orthodox like</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">this this plant is i don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">will really get get fixed</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:38.480" style="s2">in our lifetimes but at least there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">very fruitful directive that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.480" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">going on 100 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.440" style="s2">yes but first of all did i understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">you correctly did i</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.440" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">got you okay so that is a very cool idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">uh that&#39;s almost a hegelian idea i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">i have forms with</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">hegel&#39;s understanding of the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">um uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">but nevertheless that it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:02.799" style="s2">um the dialectic within the church</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">right within history uh there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.799" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">dialectic within history you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:08.880" style="s2">uh that is exemplified in the history of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">the church um because it&#39;s exemplifying</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.880" end="00:32:12.880" style="s2">now that strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">plausible at least prima facie precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.880" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">because i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">that uh processes of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">which is what churches are um are going</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">to be inherently</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">dialectical in nature and precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">because i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">um ultimately that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">something with the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">as well so i think that again both the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.240" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">vertical between people</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">and sorry the horizontal between people</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:41.840" style="s2">and the vertical between the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">levels of your ontology</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.840" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">both cry out for a dialectical approach</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.880" end="00:32:51.600" style="s2">so what you&#39;re suggesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">even if people weren&#39;t consciously or</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.600" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">practicing dialectic nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">there&#39;s dialectical processing is still</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">at work</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.640" style="s2">uh within their history is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.640" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">yes yes i think we&#39;re embedded in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">kinds of levels of dialectic that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:06.799" style="s2">not obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">aware of completely well that means</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.799" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">another function of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:16.799" style="s2">is by is through exemplification</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">to actually explicate and make bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.799" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">into self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">the fact that we instantiate and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:26.279" style="s2">layers of dialectic that&#39;s so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:28.360" style="s2">aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.279" end="00:33:29.679" style="s2">self-consciousness and coming to</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.360" end="00:33:33.039" style="s2">self-realization</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.679" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">that would be an additional function of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.039" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">the practice of dialectic so whereas</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">what you&#39;ve said is often people this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">happening implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">and unawares but when people can</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:47.679" style="s2">like like are gena or aquinas when they</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">can explicitly take up</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.679" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">dialectic they can exemplify and bring</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">into awareness bring into</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">those implicit patterns do i do i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">well yeah yeah yeah i think you you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">see it as</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">within this all it&#39;s a cosmic historical</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">dialectic that&#39;s appearing there will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">like pockets where</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">this uh dialectic is exemplified best</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">and around which like</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">more pockets of proper relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">between emergency animation</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">will spread yeah so yeah so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.560" style="s2">sort of uh original and aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.119" style="s2">as playing a part in the larger story</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.560" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.119" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">like they can&#39;t fix it all all the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">by themselves like the whole process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">the west having to go to the end</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">of its bottom-up uh view of the world to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">realize that it doesn&#39;t work like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">aquinas and the original were able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">like contribute to pockets of of harmony</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">in that all uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:41.839" style="s2">yeah yeah that whole schema but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:43.280" style="s2">still stake</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.839" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">it still takes hundreds of years to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.280" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">unfold i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">but but thank you for saying that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">i i just there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">that came out for me as a as an insight</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:00.839" style="s2">i almost want to say like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">another dimension to dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.839" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">there&#39;s the horizontal between people</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:06.320" style="s2">there&#39;s the vertical there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.040" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">ontological</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.320" end="00:35:10.079" style="s2">but there&#39;s the historical we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">embedded always</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.079" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">in processes dialectical processes</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">and one of the things we can do is bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.320" style="s2">them and this does sound more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">kegel&#39;s notion of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.320" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">we can bring them into um self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:25.599" style="s2">we can realize them</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">and then and that&#39;s an additional</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.599" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">function of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.640" style="s2">thank you for this i know that you&#39;re i</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">know that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.640" end="00:35:33.680" style="s2">you&#39;re fairly critical of narratives</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">though so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.680" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">like especially you know i i think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">dialectical worldview of history i can</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">make sense of it within</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:41.760" style="s2">christianity but i would be curious you</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">know what would be your reserves</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.760" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">ah so so um</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good point there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember his name his last name</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.839" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">strong he&#39;s on my discord server</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">and he&#39;s been writing to me and he said</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t you think that dialectic is</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">is a kind of narrative but he called it</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">a non-teleological</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">narrative because he he says it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">have it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">right the the typical structure i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">the typical structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">you have you know you have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">protagonist right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">they have to overcome right the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">antagonist and</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">and there is the climax and the denim</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:19.040" style="s2">and right</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:21.040" style="s2">and the problem is resolved so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.040" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">finite game as cars would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.040" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s the structure and i&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">realized that i because</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve over identified that as narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.160" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">to core</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">i think to be a little bit fair to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">myself precisely because i think the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">has over identified that with narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:44.160" style="s2">to core but</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">i think what uh what&#39;s coming out in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.160" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">discussion with strawn</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">is the idea that dialectic is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">trans</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">narrative um it&#39;s it&#39;s so james carson</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">going to be talking to him</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">you know our traditional notions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:01.599" style="s2">right like the the story right</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">are finite they they&#39;re the point is for</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:06.400" style="s2">them to come to an end</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">right but the point of the logos because</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.400" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:11.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s about enacting emergence</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">and emanation</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.040" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">it&#39;s an infinite game the point is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">not supposed to conclude</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to continually afford the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:21.520" style="s2">re-realization of right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">to yourself to each other and to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.520" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">world right</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">and so he was saying but isn&#39;t it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">that sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">like if you could if you could say sort</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">of the finite structure of narrative at</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.079" style="s2">least this was what i took him to say</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:35.760" style="s2">and he seemed to agree when i gave it</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.079" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">back to him i hope i&#39;m not imposing on</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:37.760" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">but if you take the finite structure of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">narrative and you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">to unfold it into what cars called an</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">right where the point is not to uh come</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">right and it&#39;s not primarily</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">oppositional where</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">the protagonist is supposed to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">the antagonist</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s like what happens in dear logos</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t that kind of trans narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">in an important way and i thought that</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">was really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">my one of my critiques of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:15.760" style="s2">is it seems to at times</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">i gotta be really careful here it seems</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.760" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">limit people to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">a sort of a linguistic imagistic</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:28.640" style="s2">level of cognition and for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:30.960" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t make enough space for</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.280" style="s2">home for the mystical dimension for</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.960" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">where people experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.280" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">non-propositional like states of</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">transformation</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">but i think given what we were saying a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">you can see dialogos if properly</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">understood as trans narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">mediates between finite narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">and the mystical that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:51.280" style="s2">i&#39;m sort of playing around with as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">idea right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.280" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">yeah yeah i think that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">and i just you you probably saw my eyes</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">lighter because</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">it mapped on to something like a tension</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:03.440" style="s2">within i should say attention between</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">like two two poles of one phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.440" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">uh the christian worldview it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:09.839" style="s2">okay the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:11.599" style="s2">you can see the narrative that&#39;s laid</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.839" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">out in christianity as</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.280" style="s2">a as a if sort of finite story with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.280" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">a middle and an end and that&#39;s it you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">can see okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">god creates the character the world at</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">that time and then he came</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:25.040" style="s2">at this time and then uh you&#39;ll come</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">back at that time</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.040" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s one one way to see it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:30.960" style="s2">you can also see that the events</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">all of these events all of these events</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.960" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">of creation like actually occur all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:35.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">like the way creation always unfolds at</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.440" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">every instant is always from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:42.160" style="s2">so god always uh emanates forms from</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">heaven he always emanates uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.160" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">potential uh all of these always meet to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">create the event in the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">everything in between it always comes</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">back to god we always mess it up with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">fall</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">and then uh there&#39;s always like some</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:53.280" style="s2">potential that will stop back up to save</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.280" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ll be judged against that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">potential and we come back to paradise</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">when when christ let&#39;s say dies on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.359" style="s2">cross uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">he says to the the one to the good thief</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.359" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">uh today you&#39;ll be with me in paralyzed</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">paris is a direct</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">you know coming back to to paris to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">garden in eden so</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">like it looks back not to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:14.240" style="s2">finally import mystery necessarily but</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">it goes back also</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.240" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">to uh the the let&#39;s say the restart of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">the story like restarting the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">you can see</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">and so you can see the narrative as</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:26.319" style="s2">both like occurring in time with a start</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">and an end</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.319" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">and you can also sit okay every instant</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.400" style="s2">and what occurs at every instant is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">much more let&#39;s say mystical part</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.400" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">the the part that you know demand that</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">recovers</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">uh transformation that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">apply to your life right now it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">point that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">sometimes um people will like priests</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">will say in homilies but if we read</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:47.599" style="s2">parts of the of revelation or the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">apocalypse if we read parts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.599" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">press pronouncements about the end of</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">the world and if we think that it only</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">matters for let&#39;s say that day when the</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">end time comes that it means that like</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">almost all christians for almost all of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">us three will have read this for nothing</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">like because</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah but we should like see</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">occurring at their instant and so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">should like</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">always be in directing we do i mean i do</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">there is such a thing as see a global</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">of this pattern that will actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what the end will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s described as a city or as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">garden so it&#39;s not like it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:22.880" style="s2">state where nothing changes but i do</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.880" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">that it will unfold across time i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">it is i&#39;m falling across time but i also</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">think that at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">we can like immediate between this story</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.119" style="s2">that takes forever and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">our own lives right now and apply all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.119" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">this spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">i would agree with that uh uh to a large</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">degree</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">precisely because one way you can think</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">of mythos</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">is precisely as something that&#39;s trans</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">narrative in the way i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">because you get a story in it a myth or</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">even</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">or even more so a parable right that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">looks like a finite story</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s not right it actually sets you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">uh an infinite an infinite uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">trans-narrative dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:09.359" style="s2">um and so uh myths</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">i think in that when properly understood</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.359" end="00:42:12.800" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">and i think they&#39;re they&#39;re improperly</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.800" end="00:42:17.119" style="s2">misunderstood when people</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">and this is the the sin of literal</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.119" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">literalism where you</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.319" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">you you bind it into a particular uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:25.359" style="s2">time and place and location</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">um you make it a purely finite story</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.359" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">rather than seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:31.200" style="s2">the prodigal son for example the parable</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">is something that is going to occur me</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.200" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">occur to me every day and and and there</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">is no conclusion to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">the parable of the prodigal son of you</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">like when people just allegorize it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">come to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">i think that&#39;s almost blasphemous in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">some ways i&#39;m sorry my language is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.440" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">getting very religious here</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">um but um uh because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">at different points in my life i have</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">found that i identify and take the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">perspective of different players</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:57.760" style="s2">in that little drama and what i&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">to realize is that story doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.760" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">conclude</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s always a perpetual time bomb that</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">will go off and remind me</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">that in my pursuit of justice i have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">remember compassion</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">and in my exemplification of compassion</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">i cannot</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">destroy the structures of justice and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:15.040" style="s2">that there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">that there is a recognition of human</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.040" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">finitude but also human aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">right and all of that i have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">remembering because i will</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">i will tend towards extremes and i will</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">tend</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">to gravitate to those sinkholes of local</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">you know local minimal right but what</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">the parable does</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">right this little finite piece of text</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">puts me in the infinite dialectic where</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">i&#39;m constantly moving between</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">individuation and participation</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll use your language between heaven</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.040" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">and earth and i never stop</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">i never stop and that&#39;s what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">grab</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:52.560" style="s2">i think to not grab that&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">word to grasp to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.560" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">a parable and to be grabbed by it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">what i wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what i would argue that myth</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">mythos and parable</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">right are the language they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of the artistic twin</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.720" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">to what you see in more propositional</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">language within</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">uh dialectic but this comes out in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:14.880" style="s2">practice when you&#39;re doing these</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">practices with people</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.880" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">they move between their statements and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:21.599" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">of the all these metaphorical poetic</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.599" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">gestures that they actually enact over</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">and over again</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:28.319" style="s2">and they get a sense of these deeper</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.319" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">that are repeating throughout their</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">lives coming to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">yeah cool i&#39;d like to try to bring it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">us today uh in 2020 because if</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">my best guess you know regarding this</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">whole historical</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">uh dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">right now we&#39;re i don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">seeing the end of a let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">a strictly bottom-up world view of just</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:45:00.400" style="s2">trying to see matter and all</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:04.480" style="s2">how it combines and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.400" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">mirrors a breakdown in our view of</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.480" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">let&#39;s say social systems where we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">all kinds of social systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:12.319" style="s2">dialectic isn&#39;t working really within</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:14.240" style="s2">the university it&#39;s not really working</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.319" end="00:45:15.760" style="s2">within individual in society between</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.240" end="00:45:17.520" style="s2">groups and society and so on yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.760" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">see sort of this this widespread</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.520" end="00:45:22.400" style="s2">uh collapse in our our systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">but on the other end you see the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.400" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">emergence of new systems like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:27.440" style="s2">mentioned all of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">the the movement submits and so on like</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.440" end="00:45:31.680" style="s2">new emerging</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">practices that promise to on the one end</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.680" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">they emerge</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">through dialectic through people like</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">interacting with one another and across</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">communities</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">and from this emerges finer and finer uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:43.839" style="s2">sets of practices and institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">so on that will take the place of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.839" end="00:45:47.280" style="s2">fading ones</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">and you know on the other end i do think</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.280" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">that even within</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:52.240" style="s2">within cuchinity you see this as well we</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">we touched on it just a bit last time</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.240" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">and i did</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">i was a bit more mindful of it recently</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">but you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a shift going on</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:00.880" style="s2">within well i just</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.680" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">especially within christianity because</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.880" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the one i know most i know that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">people are moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">more sort of simplistic uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.520" style="s2">non-liturgical uh kinds of practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">people are moving back and see</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.520" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">even within the protestant churches</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">they&#39;re moving to more liturgical</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">people moving uh sometimes right away to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:23.599" style="s2">either catholic or</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">uh orthodox uh denominations because you</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.599" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">they have richer world views more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">dialectic across people</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">and more than just even like in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:32.720" style="s2">setting of a church where you do</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">dialectic you know with your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.720" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">and also with your priests with you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">this is richer that i think is richer in</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">the older traditions within the catholic</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">church there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:43.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it may actually be a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">like so many people want to move back</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.760" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">that it&#39;s uh some yeah it may cause</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:50.000" style="s2">problems like people want their masses</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">back in latin and so on</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.000" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">uh and like the older churches are</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:56.319" style="s2">gathering more people</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">so you see like emerging with even</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.319" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">within the church certain</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">sets of practices certain theologies</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">being more</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:08.480" style="s2">uh favored than others so like by</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">trying to to tend to those favorable</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.480" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2">emerging</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">positions right i do have just because</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">of my christian commitments</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">and seeing this world view as viable to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">me i do have like</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">a fair amount of hope in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:20.319" style="s2">that this will be heading in a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.319" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that it will be good</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">necessarily for us churches have gone</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">extinct and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">like that overall the course of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:28.640" style="s2">dialectic will be in a positive</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">good aspects of the standard i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">know exactly what it will look like in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">practice but</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">i let&#39;s say we there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">good occurring in this corner of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:46.079" style="s2">internet i think so i do my best to try</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">to foster</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.079" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">this one i agree with that i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">hungry for mythos and given our</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:48:00.240" style="s2">this is this is enmeshed with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:02.319" style="s2">a hunger uh for for dear logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.240" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">and for practices like dialectic which</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.319" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">will help really</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:07.119" style="s2">realize the illegals i think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">hunger for both of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.119" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">um and it&#39;s profound so yeah it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">strike me as at all coincidental</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">that there&#39;s these simultaneously these</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">innovative new communities of ecclesia</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:22.800" style="s2">coming into existence and then more</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">dynamically layered and dialectical and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.800" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">symbolically informed</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">forms of christianity which are called</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">older which is completely right i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">are also coming into prominence um what</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">what needs to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.480" style="s2">well we need caution on both ends we</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:39.520" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.480" end="00:48:41.760" style="s2">to avoid the conservatives bias</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:42.720" style="s2">that the old is therefore better because</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.760" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s old</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.720" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">and the radical&#39;s biased that the new is</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">better precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s new uh and both of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">i think if left unreflected upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">and unchecked uh could make this go awry</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:01.200" style="s2">in powerful ways like you could see</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">the the the the like you said you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.200" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">already said there&#39;s probably problems</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">with people trying to go back</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">like do you need to bring things back in</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">latin right right right</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">uh should we dress in roman tunics right</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">now how far back and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:14.720" style="s2">and what what what&#39;s going and then of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">course there&#39;s the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.720" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">innovation for the sake of innovation</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">which has become an intoxicant for our</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:24.400" style="s2">is also a particular bias uh so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.319" style="s2">the two pools of dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.400" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">either going all the way back to your</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.319" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">position where you don&#39;t change or going</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:30.160" style="s2">all the way back to the other position</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.040" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">to which you&#39;re aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.160" end="00:49:34.319" style="s2">and that&#39;s without like doing any uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">relationalization between the two to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:39.839" style="s2">point that&#39;s actually fruitful to both</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.960" style="s2">yeah and i think i would i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.839" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t have a lot of time to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.960" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">it today but what&#39;s what what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">out as also a potential topic</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">is the relationship between relevance</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">realization and this function of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">that you&#39;ve been talking a lot about uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">because you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:58.160" style="s2">uh obviously dialectic enhances</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">relevance realization and powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.160" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">but as we&#39;ve noted both within the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">christian context and in the socratic</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">context um it also enhances mediation</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">um in in important ways and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">i&#39;m also trying to reflect on um even</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">even the self-naming as philia sophia</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">someone who&#39;s always in love with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:21.359" style="s2">and never will come into</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">right a full possession of it um that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.359" end="00:50:23.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a statement of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">we&#39;re inherently</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.920" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">the relevance realization is always a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:29.359" style="s2">mediating one um</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">what i would like at some point to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.359" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">explore explore that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">that that german idea with you a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">bit more too</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">yeah sure something going on there</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:41.119" style="s2">jonathan has made this argument to me</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.280" end="00:50:43.839" style="s2">and then mary mary cohen</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.119" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">somebody you and i both talked with um</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.839" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">also powerfully made that argument</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">about you know and i noted it at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">time being important so it stuck with me</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">as a seed thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">you know that this role of mediation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:57.599" style="s2">then you</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">independently uh but i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.599" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">convergently with mary&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:03.280" style="s2">you know that that people when people</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">cease to experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.280" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">themselves as intermediaries</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:11.359" style="s2">right um when that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">the model it&#39;s not only that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.359" end="00:51:16.880" style="s2">monolithic mind was monological</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.240" style="s2">and self-enclosed but it was also this</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.880" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">follows from it it was also</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.240" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">in no way a mediating mind and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:23.599" style="s2">also deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">your point is that&#39;s also been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.599" end="00:51:26.240" style="s2">problematic and that&#39;s mary&#39;s point too</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.240" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">this is something that needs to be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">juicy i can feel it intuitively that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a juicy point</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s filled with epistemic and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">transformative juices</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">that we need to try and uh get back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:39.200" style="s2">at some point maybe the three of us</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">should talk again at some point about</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.200" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">that topic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">yeah that&#39;d be fun i&#39;m sure she&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">happy too do you know that uh jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:48.880" style="s2">and paul and i are going to have a joint</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">uh dialogue soon yeah that would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">great because i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">that yeah the event in september</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">probably won&#39;t work in</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">international it&#39;s been yeah it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">canceled that that event</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">well at least not it&#39;s been canceled but</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">like in the sense of postponed to when</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">it will be possible again</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">yeah yeah but uh yeah i was i was hoping</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">maybe i could go but i&#39;ll be very happy</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">to just listen to the three of you as</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">well that means we that brings a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">sadness to me because if we had had the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">conference i would have got to meet you</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:20.240" style="s2">in person as well</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">there&#39;s so many people that i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">met in person and very much like to</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">is there i mean we&#39;re getting close to</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">an hour is there anything more</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:32.240" style="s2">i mean we i think we touched a lot in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">very rich fashion</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.240" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">is there anything more you you want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">address or bring out on this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">naturally quickly i do think</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:42.319" style="s2">what you just said about real</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">naturalization coming into the mix is</p>

<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:45.839" style="s2">to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.400" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be today because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">a big topic but i i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">there that could really help christians</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:56.079" style="s2">such as me understand</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">miracles in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.079" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">too fraught with problems when when we</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">just about a year ago about the</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">advantages and disadvantages of our</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">respective physicians</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">and one of the worries coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">religious side is you have to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:16.319" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">let&#39;s call if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.319" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">if you can bring miracles in your</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">ontology you have to do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">won&#39;t lead to you bullshitting</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:24.640" style="s2">yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">yes and i do it does look to me like</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.640" end="00:53:29.359" style="s2">whenever you look at something emerging</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">like there&#39;s always some aspect of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.359" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">miracle there and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.559" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">some people you you see people often</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:36.720" style="s2">within the religious side or even like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">the pensacon side and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.720" end="00:53:40.400" style="s2">telling non-reductive physicalists that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:41.680" style="s2">well your idea of emergence is just</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.400" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">miraculous it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.680" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">but i i i&#39;d like to use it the other way</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">around you know rather than saying that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">it means that international physicalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">is like to be thrown the window i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:54.240" style="s2">if we can use the uh the ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">empirical research</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.240" end="00:53:58.240" style="s2">around the emergence to better</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">understand how</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.240" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">somehow the the an overarching pattern</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">an overarching form</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">can meet with with potential with matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">in a way that explains this miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">emergence i think it could help</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:13.359" style="s2">christians you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">better deal with the problematic</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.359" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">problematic aspects of miracles</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">it it looks like there&#39;s a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">there like if you look at anytime like</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">just a particle appears from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:23.280" style="s2">layer of physics it looks like a small</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">miracle</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.280" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">yes you look at the way when i make a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">decision if you were to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">happens in my brain like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">coordination of all</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">different networks it would also look</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">like a miracle and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">i think like at the highest scale if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">looked at let&#39;s see the incarnation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.000" style="s2">all the different miracles that jesus</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">performed it you know it does look like</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.000" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">a miracle when you look at it at our</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">human level but if you take</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">let&#39;s see the theologian uh point of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">view if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.839" style="s2">see what&#39;s the meaning of those then it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">can become part of a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.839" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">that that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:59.280" style="s2">all of a sudden and that also it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">gives you a criteria for determining</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.280" end="00:55:02.079" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">miracles are real and which aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.079" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just let&#39;s argue about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:07.200" style="s2">material aspect of it but that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:09.040" style="s2">that is more concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.200" end="00:55:11.359" style="s2">overarching pattern in all of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.040" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">like does does the does the pattern make</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.359" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">sense in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.000" style="s2">if i were to to look at let&#39;s see my</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">decision uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.000" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">occurring when such and such miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">occurrences happen within my brain</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">that i could sort of map magnitude uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">so but it has to do directly with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:30.400" style="s2">see the role of relationalization</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">between dialectic how is it that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.400" end="00:55:35.280" style="s2">different you know that the many</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">in the potential can combine into</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.280" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">under a certain pattern so i i would</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">definitely hope that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:44.079" style="s2">to to have such a discussion at some</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:45.520" style="s2">point don&#39;t i don&#39;t i would have more</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.079" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">time today but i don&#39;t know if you do as</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.520" end="00:55:47.520" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t have too much more time</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.520" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">today but we i i&#39;m also very happy to</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">meet with you again and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">i&#39;d like to set this aside because uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">i i mean i set it aside for our next</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">meeting uh but</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:03.680" style="s2">not dismiss it what i mean is uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">let&#39;s make a commitment i&#39;m making a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.680" end="00:56:06.640" style="s2">commitment to let&#39;s have another</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">discussion about this</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.640" end="00:56:13.839" style="s2">i like what you said there because um</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">sorry again between friends i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.839" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">quite understood the commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">miracles i never</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:20.799" style="s2">understood why it was like why is this</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">so important when does it matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.799" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">right like other and what i mean in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:26.799" style="s2">non-question-making fashion i understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:29.040" style="s2">if you&#39;re already committed</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.799" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">to a particular thing and it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.040" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">miracles within it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">you there but you have a you have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">derived commitment to the miracles</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">within it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.680" style="s2">but there seems to be an independent</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">thing which is no you know i</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.680" end="00:56:40.559" style="s2">i have an independent commitment to this</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">which i never understood but you you</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.559" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">just told it how about something that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.000" end="00:56:45.760" style="s2">was really really provocative are you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:49.680" style="s2">really cooking with gas today</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.760" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">the idea the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.680" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">there is emergence</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">carries within it some sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:56:58.799" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just point out that you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.799" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">for aerogena creation is precisely that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:04.240" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">dialectically brings together emanation</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.240" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">and emergence</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s what creation is it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:12.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t just making</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">we we we&#39;ve forgotten that making is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.240" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">model for creation it is not the same</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:19.839" style="s2">thing as creation</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">so and what i heard you saying is</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.839" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">and i heard of i like whitehead was in</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">my head but you know whitehead said</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">everything comes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.000" style="s2">all things come into one thing that is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">new thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.000" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">right that there&#39;s inherent creativity</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:33.640" style="s2">as whitehead puts it</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">right there and i think this is like</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.640" end="00:57:38.400" style="s2">persist notion of quality too</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">what i heard you saying in all of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.400" end="00:57:43.520" style="s2">notions</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">there is the creation of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.520" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">and the proper way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">is to see it as therefore miraculous</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">where miraculous doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">inconsistent or non-intelligible because</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.480" style="s2">you mentioned deep continuity</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s only until it&#39;s always only</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.480" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">intelligible after the fact</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of a white-headed idea you</p>

<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">predict the novelty because then it</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.319" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be novelty</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">but if it was just if if you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">reconnect it backwards</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">it would just be absolute chaos yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s meant it&#39;s meant to bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">us into something higher</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">um in the same way that when when i do</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:28.079" style="s2">reverse rise</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">one revolutionization occurs and you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.079" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">see all of different networks coalescing</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">pattern in my brain it&#39;s meant to bring</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">all of those different neurons</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:37.680" style="s2">into an overarching pattern right like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">spark of the miraculous</p>

<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:05.440" style="s2">you know has laid out of all the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.920" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">machinery and he&#39;s able to leverage it</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.440" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">to talk about miracles and providence</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.359" end="00:59:11.599" style="s2">he&#39;s able to say that well the goal of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:14.240" style="s2">miracles is precisely this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.599" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">that through different actions that god</p>

<p begin="00:59:27.520" end="00:59:31.359" style="s2">nomination</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:33.599" style="s2">like miracles matter because they</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.359" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">they they&#39;re like pointers for us to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:36.720" style="s2">brought into</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">uh the divine life to get brought into</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.720" end="00:59:39.760" style="s2">the very processes of</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">real menstrualization but if i</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.760" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">understood you</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:47.119" style="s2">you&#39;re emphasizing that there</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:48.480" style="s2">even in everyday events and this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.119" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">where i heard whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.480" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">the the notion of creative events even</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">in everyday events</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">uh you know of oxygen and hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">coming together</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">this is the hackneyed example and water</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:02.079" style="s2">emerging and water is novel in some way</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">to hydrogen and oxygen you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.079" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">that that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:09.839" style="s2">spark of novelty that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">there there&#39;s a you can say a deep</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.839" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">continuity right</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what i was going to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep continuity between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">miraculous</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">and the natural in in what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">proposing</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:22.559" style="s2">yeah typically what uh what the language</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:23.760" style="s2">that is often used and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.559" end="01:00:24.799" style="s2">this is modeled because i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.760" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">different people use different</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.799" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">definitions but</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">like typically people will talk about</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">providence</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">uh for everything that is like below</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.319" end="01:00:37.040" style="s2">below i don&#39;t want to say the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:37.520" style="s2">supernatural it&#39;s not true like when</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.040" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">whenever</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.520" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">god acts directly whenever you can say</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:42.319" style="s2">the whatever heaven and earth meet</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.319" end="01:00:46.000" style="s2">what you see will be miracles uh so at</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">the highest scale</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.000" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">when we would say in the incarnation</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:51.680" style="s2">what what occurred there was</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:53.599" style="s2">miracles but what occurs at lower levels</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.680" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">say the fact that uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.599" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">in our discussion today we&#39;re able to to</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">meet and we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">to uh say meaningful things that neither</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">of us have thought about</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">quite well within within in christianity</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:08.160" style="s2">this would be providence it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:10.720" style="s2">we have uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.160" end="01:01:11.920" style="s2">an emergence of meaningful patterns that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.720" end="01:01:13.599" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t have predicted otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.920" end="01:01:15.040" style="s2">that you can see that</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.599" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">the ground of relevance organization</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.040" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">still participated in that although at</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">more more common scale you can say than</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">what occurred at the incarnation</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s even more common if you look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:26.160" style="s2">this uh this is subatomic level</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s still a meeting of emergency</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.160" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">ammunition there that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:32.960" style="s2">because i i&#39;m i i typically and i i</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:34.720" style="s2">don&#39;t mean to be insulting i typically</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.960" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">don&#39;t find the notion of miracles</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.720" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">you know useful or helpful</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">my intelligence but what you did there</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">proposing sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:45.520" style="s2">it sounded to me like you proposed that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:46.160" style="s2">a deep continuity between miracles</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.520" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2">providence</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.160" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">and something like the ground of being</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">or the you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s it you can sing maybe nature or</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">okay then okay yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:58.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s cool that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">wow</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.400" end="01:02:02.319" style="s2">i would like to talk about this uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.319" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">because i would want to i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">if you have pointers for what i could</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">think about for the next discussion you</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">know i&#39;d be really happy to hear them</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">and ponder them</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:15.119" style="s2">yeah well let me i mean the person that</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">keeps</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.119" end="01:02:19.280" style="s2">coming to my mind right now is um is</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">whitehead there&#39;s i think it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.280" end="01:02:22.640" style="s2">a book written by by rose on an</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:24.319" style="s2">introduction to whitehead</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.640" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a really it&#39;s a thin volume but</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.319" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an excellent</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">um really good uh introduction to</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">whitehead</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.039" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">um and whitehead is of course deeply</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:35.520" style="s2">influenced by brooks hall</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:37.039" style="s2">but he&#39;s also doing um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.520" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">what you&#39;ve been doing and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">been talking about i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:42.400" style="s2">he proposes the notion of creative</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.400" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2">um as a way of</p>

<p begin="01:02:54.000" end="01:02:58.319" style="s2">uh by the advances both at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">relativistic level and the quantum level</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.319" end="01:03:05.680" style="s2">there&#39;s also um whitehead&#39;s book might</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">be really good religion in the making</p>
