<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:10.920" style="s2">Tim Adeline and this is a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.849" end="00:00:14.840" style="s2">with David fuller hope you enjoy</p>

<p begin="00:00:14.840" end="00:00:20.060" style="s2">so now the tables are turned instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.450" end="00:00:22.730" style="s2">instead of doing the interview I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.060" end="00:00:25.250" style="s2">to use yeah all I really know ten is</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.730" end="00:00:26.630" style="s2">that you contacted me and said you feel</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.250" end="00:00:28.279" style="s2">a real alignment with what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.630" end="00:00:31.130" style="s2">and what we&#39;re doing and would like an</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.279" end="00:00:34.460" style="s2">interview so tell me more well means</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.130" end="00:00:36.170" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that well perhaps this really</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.460" end="00:00:38.090" style="s2">should begin with me asking you what</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.170" end="00:00:39.410" style="s2">rebel wisdoms about I mean to get at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.090" end="00:00:41.390" style="s2">alignment I&#39;d have to tell you what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.410" end="00:00:44.780" style="s2">doing and then that might take a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.390" end="00:00:46.600" style="s2">bit of time but fundamentally I see you</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.780" end="00:00:48.650" style="s2">attempting gap conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.600" end="00:00:51.230" style="s2">interesting and important people as they</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.650" end="00:00:53.810" style="s2">appear out of the haze on the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.230" end="00:00:55.430" style="s2">stage at the moment and you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.810" end="00:00:57.260" style="s2">interested in who you are and why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.430" end="00:00:59.540" style="s2">doing that and perhaps ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.260" end="00:01:02.120" style="s2">the personal drive is that finds you in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.540" end="00:01:03.560" style="s2">the position you are I guess the simple</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.120" end="00:01:06.470" style="s2">answer is that I feel that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.560" end="00:01:08.330" style="s2">meant to be doing I&#39;ve got a set of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.470" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">skills from being a journalist and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.330" end="00:01:14.890" style="s2">documentary maker for a long time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:18.039" style="s2">never felt like a complete fit with</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.890" end="00:01:20.689" style="s2">partly the mainstream media and partly</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.039" end="00:01:22.999" style="s2">just TV as a medium it didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.689" end="00:01:24.679" style="s2">seem to go deep enough and since I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.999" end="00:01:26.810" style="s2">started making stuff for YouTube I kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.679" end="00:01:28.490" style="s2">of realized that one there&#39;s an appetite</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.810" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">for real intellectual content again</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.490" end="00:01:34.069" style="s2">which is great and also that I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:35.749" style="s2">something to offer and I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.069" end="00:01:39.049" style="s2">have to offer is I see how things fit</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.749" end="00:01:41.719" style="s2">together like I see who when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.049" end="00:01:44.389" style="s2">saw Jordan Peterson last year I knew</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.719" end="00:01:46.490" style="s2">straight away that this was the key</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.389" end="00:01:49.189" style="s2">message that we needed to integrate as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.490" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">culture it&#39;s like materialism is</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.189" end="00:01:52.819" style="s2">breaking down a lot of the structures</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.409" style="s2">are breaking down under the force of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.819" end="00:01:57.679" style="s2">like the Deconstructor force of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.409" end="00:02:00.229" style="s2">internet and there&#39;s there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.679" end="00:02:02.030" style="s2">sense that this is the time for new</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.229" end="00:02:03.799" style="s2">ideas and I think white people are</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.030" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">really hungry for new ideas is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.799" end="00:02:08.990" style="s2">we all sense certainly with the election</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:10.459" style="s2">of trumpets like the idea the adults are</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.990" end="00:02:15.260" style="s2">in charge in any kind of meaningful way</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.459" end="00:02:18.590" style="s2">is is obviously not true and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.260" end="00:02:20.240" style="s2">all kind of sense that something yeah on</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.590" end="00:02:22.040" style="s2">some deep level a lot of the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.240" end="00:02:24.439" style="s2">the running Western society for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.040" end="00:02:26.689" style="s2">while are breaking down and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.439" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">is yeah it&#39;s the end of materialism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.689" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">the end of the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:30.749" style="s2">rational intellect that questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">everything or questions everything until</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.749" end="00:02:33.810" style="s2">it can&#39;t question anything else I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of post-modernism in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.810" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">and what we need is a reintegration of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:41.999" style="s2">the sacred the archetypal the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">mythological the irrational for want of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.999" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">a better word and that&#39;s what I see in</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:49.230" style="s2">Peterson and that&#39;s what I see I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:51.239" style="s2">rebel wisdom I think is a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.230" end="00:02:53.969" style="s2">they say that every great newspaper is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.239" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">conversation so it may not agree all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.969" end="00:02:57.689" style="s2">time or there may be different</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:59.579" style="s2">perspectives say like a great newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.689" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">will have different perspectives but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.579" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">will have a certain overall tone and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:07.139" style="s2">overall tone of rebel wisdom is what are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">the ideas what are the practices what</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.139" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">are the kind of embodied forms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.409" style="s2">knowledge that we need to get through</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:16.379" style="s2">what I think are going to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.409" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">chaotic next 10 years or so and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.379" end="00:03:19.109" style="s2">we&#39;re doing stuff about psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.109" end="00:03:24.599" style="s2">important kind of opening up to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:26.669" style="s2">beyond that the numinous that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.599" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">we&#39;re also doing workshops because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.669" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">think you can do the film you can make</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">films and I think we are making like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:36.569" style="s2">really interesting films interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">interviews but ultimately you have to if</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.569" end="00:03:41.189" style="s2">you want to put an idea into practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:43.229" style="s2">you have to build that into your life</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.189" end="00:03:45.569" style="s2">and you have to question your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.229" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">you have to question your conditioning</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.569" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">the way you were brought up sort of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:51.659" style="s2">the ways that you hold yourself back and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">I think all of that like I think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.659" end="00:03:57.120" style="s2">next 10 years are gonna challenge us all</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">on every level what we thought was true</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.120" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">we&#39;re realizing is not true kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s still a kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">concept but I think a lot of its also</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:06.989" style="s2">gonna really test our emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:08.759" style="s2">resilience but the chaos of the times is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:10.739" style="s2">gonna it&#39;s already happening with social</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.759" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">media like anxiety and depression and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.739" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">all of these things are growing usually</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:16.229" style="s2">because we&#39;re overwhelmed and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:18.780" style="s2">being overwhelmed by the world and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.229" end="00:04:21.509" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna keep happening I think even</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.780" end="00:04:23.460" style="s2">just on in my particular area of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.509" end="00:04:25.530" style="s2">expertise I guess is foreign foreign</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.460" end="00:04:29.909" style="s2">affairs and I look around the world my</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.530" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">see five or six flash points that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.909" end="00:04:38.250" style="s2">likely to explode and likely to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:40.360" style="s2">yeah even even that let alone kind of AI</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.250" end="00:04:42.909" style="s2">and all the other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.360" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">essential threats I think we&#39;re yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.909" end="00:04:46.599" style="s2">think we&#39;re in for a really rocky time</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:47.800" style="s2">yeah and I also think that if you look</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.599" end="00:04:50.379" style="s2">at the intellectual diet web for example</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.800" end="00:04:53.110" style="s2">that kind of it&#39;s a loose it&#39;s a loose</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.379" end="00:04:55.900" style="s2">kind of name for a loose movement but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.110" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">think as a what I sense the movement is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.900" end="00:05:00.159" style="s2">is a is a coming to consciousness of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:01.689" style="s2">these kind of conversations you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.159" end="00:05:03.969" style="s2">you look at say the Weinstein brothers</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.689" end="00:05:05.349" style="s2">on Dave Rubin that they&#39;re raising the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.969" end="00:05:09.669" style="s2">biggest questions and looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.349" end="00:05:11.680" style="s2">biggest answers and that that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.669" end="00:05:13.930" style="s2">rebel wisdom is part of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:17.620" style="s2">conversation already we&#39;re and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.930" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">trying to we&#39;re trying to to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.620" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">that conversation to push it forward and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">to also bring the parts of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:24.310" style="s2">conversation that aren&#39;t being had</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:25.750" style="s2">because there&#39;s still a danger but just</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.310" end="00:05:26.830" style="s2">be an intellectual conversation like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.750" end="00:05:28.810" style="s2">intellectual dialogue it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.830" end="00:05:30.340" style="s2">intellectual conversation actually I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.810" end="00:05:33.159" style="s2">think we need a much deeper resolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.340" end="00:05:34.539" style="s2">of that sort of an integrating so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.159" end="00:05:37.330" style="s2">got interviews with the likes of Stan</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.539" end="00:05:39.159" style="s2">Grof stomachs laugh Groff who was the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.330" end="00:05:41.889" style="s2">sort of pioneer of psychedelic therapy</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.159" end="00:05:45.669" style="s2">in the 1950s and 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.889" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">Richard tarnis who was with Stan Grof as</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.669" end="00:05:50.710" style="s2">a philosopher in residence at Esalen who</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:51.969" style="s2">I think wrote the best book about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.710" end="00:05:53.139" style="s2">history of Western culture and where</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.969" end="00:05:56.710" style="s2">we&#39;re going called the passion of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.139" end="00:05:58.599" style="s2">Western mind interesting and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.710" end="00:06:00.339" style="s2">looking for who are the thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.599" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">like we have that into group of</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.339" end="00:06:04.089" style="s2">Sheldrake which i think is one of our</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">sort of most popular things so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.089" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">looking at saying okay here are the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:10.689" style="s2">thinkers just outside the mainstream of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.189" style="s2">Western thought who probably have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.689" end="00:06:14.830" style="s2">answers like they&#39;ve never been accepted</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.189" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">into the kind of the grand current of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.830" end="00:06:18.430" style="s2">Western thought or Western culture but</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:21.610" style="s2">they&#39;re holding these really important</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.430" end="00:06:23.680" style="s2">pieces and I&#39;d add to Jamie wheal too</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.610" end="00:06:27.279" style="s2">that was a kind of who&#39;s a modern day</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.680" end="00:06:28.689" style="s2">flow expert like he he&#39;s holding a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.279" end="00:06:30.250" style="s2">really key piece so I&#39;m looking around</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.689" end="00:06:33.069" style="s2">and seeing how the pieces fit together</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.250" end="00:06:34.900" style="s2">and say ok he&#39;s got an important piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.069" end="00:06:36.430" style="s2">this person got an important piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.900" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">she&#39;s got an important piece I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.430" end="00:06:41.830" style="s2">everything there is but Louise Mazzanti</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.610" end="00:06:44.259" style="s2">for example who&#39;s appeared in a few of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.830" end="00:06:47.469" style="s2">our films so far I think is is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.259" end="00:06:49.870" style="s2">incredible force and is is again holding</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.469" end="00:06:51.100" style="s2">a really important piece of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.870" end="00:06:53.230" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a powerful presence in her</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.100" end="00:06:55.990" style="s2">doubt about that yeah and I hope that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.230" end="00:06:59.050" style="s2">a year&#39;s time lots of the people that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.990" end="00:07:01.060" style="s2">featured have a much higher profile that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.050" end="00:07:03.130" style="s2">in the same way that we put out the</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.060" end="00:07:06.729" style="s2">piece about Jordan Peterson and then he</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.130" end="00:07:08.110" style="s2">he reached this sort of new audience</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.729" end="00:07:09.729" style="s2">simultaneously I&#39;m not saying that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.110" end="00:07:11.560" style="s2">were in any way responsible for that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.729" end="00:07:13.270" style="s2">about a million factors yeah I&#39;m a total</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.560" end="00:07:15.699" style="s2">course I&#39;m not I&#39;m not saying that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.270" end="00:07:17.470" style="s2">I am saying I knew that that would</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.699" end="00:07:19.389" style="s2">happen nothing the first question I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.470" end="00:07:21.040" style="s2">asked him during my interview was one</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.389" end="00:07:22.389" style="s2">what do you make of what&#39;s been going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.040" end="00:07:26.139" style="s2">and two are you ready for it to keep</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.389" end="00:07:27.669" style="s2">going mmm because I knew that it was he</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.139" end="00:07:33.700" style="s2">was on this exponential curve and</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.669" end="00:07:35.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a yeah I really that named the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.700" end="00:07:37.870" style="s2">exponential curve I think really sums up</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.590" end="00:07:39.820" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing I think we&#39;re on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.870" end="00:07:41.860" style="s2">same exponential curve and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.820" end="00:07:44.380" style="s2">exponential curve so what the what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.860" end="00:07:47.260" style="s2">Internet allows is to sort of crowd</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.380" end="00:07:51.400" style="s2">source than assess the necessary answers</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.260" end="00:07:53.470" style="s2">and the necessary information for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.400" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">time mm-hmm and that&#39;s so Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.470" end="00:07:56.380" style="s2">Peterson was basically crowdsource the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:57.729" style="s2">intellectual diet was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.380" end="00:08:00.070" style="s2">crowdsource they were forced together</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.729" end="00:08:02.169" style="s2">like Dave Rubin talks about this was</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.070" end="00:08:04.060" style="s2">meant to happen because they were so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.169" end="00:08:05.710" style="s2">popular they were being forced on to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.060" end="00:08:09.099" style="s2">each other shows by their audience hey</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.710" end="00:08:12.450" style="s2">get Sam Harris on get Joe Rogan on so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.099" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a real the Internet has allowed</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.450" end="00:08:19.180" style="s2">this sort of self-generated conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:21.310" style="s2">to emerge and it&#39;s just in time I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.180" end="00:08:23.139" style="s2">and the fact that it&#39;s emerging shows</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.310" end="00:08:25.300" style="s2">that everything is quite fragile like</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.139" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s being summoned on some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:30.280" style="s2">archetypal level that we need the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:33.339" style="s2">answers we need are being summoned by</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.280" end="00:08:35.289" style="s2">the internet and crowd-sourced as we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.339" end="00:08:39.159" style="s2">need them and I think that&#39;s that gives</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.289" end="00:08:41.229" style="s2">me hope that it also also pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.159" end="00:08:43.570" style="s2">all of the kind of the best thinkers I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.229" end="00:08:46.180" style="s2">know are quite pessimistic about our</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.570" end="00:08:50.730" style="s2">prospects for the next 10 years or so</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.180" end="00:08:53.320" style="s2">like we we&#39;re still acting like tribal</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.730" end="00:08:56.380" style="s2">beings in a world where tribalism is no</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.320" end="00:08:58.060" style="s2">longer an option for example right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.380" end="00:09:01.209" style="s2">well no that was brilliant I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.060" end="00:09:02.529" style="s2">so much there so at one level it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.209" end="00:09:05.410" style="s2">what are those idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.529" end="00:09:07.089" style="s2">that are built for storms and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.410" end="00:09:10.300" style="s2">properly talk about them and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.089" end="00:09:12.999" style="s2">them when the time comes but the time is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.300" end="00:09:15.610" style="s2">always now because there is always</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.999" end="00:09:17.850" style="s2">responsibility you can take for whether</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.610" end="00:09:20.079" style="s2">it&#39;s integrating something difficult or</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.850" end="00:09:21.819" style="s2">looking to that place where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.079" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">vulnerable and trying to speak to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.819" end="00:09:27.009" style="s2">and apply in a way that&#39;s practical and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:29.470" style="s2">health oriented for your life so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.009" end="00:09:31.990" style="s2">mentioned in Jordan Peterson and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.470" end="00:09:35.649" style="s2">also mentioned an exponential curve I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.990" end="00:09:38.559" style="s2">be interested in the shape you see that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.649" end="00:09:40.809" style="s2">curve taking now obviously it&#39;s a curve</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.559" end="00:09:42.910" style="s2">upwards one would hope but there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.809" end="00:09:44.949" style="s2">interesting idea that comes out of many</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.910" end="00:09:47.620" style="s2">mystical ways of thinking and also out</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.949" end="00:09:51.490" style="s2">of Stan Groff&#39;s work and our chemical</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.620" end="00:09:52.899" style="s2">ideas and and many other ways but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.490" end="00:09:54.339" style="s2">just generally this idea of cycles of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.899" end="00:09:56.230" style="s2">transformation or deaths and rebirths</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.339" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">and you can consider them metaphorically</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.230" end="00:10:02.470" style="s2">or we could get metaphysical about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:04.749" style="s2">but at the metaphorical level applying</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.470" end="00:10:06.639" style="s2">that to the idea of this upward curve it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.749" end="00:10:09.430" style="s2">means there are going to be you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.639" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">troughs and and then Peaks again almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.430" end="00:10:12.939" style="s2">as if if you&#39;re moving towards a vision</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.170" end="00:10:14.529" style="s2">and and you&#39;re at the top of a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.939" end="00:10:16.269" style="s2">you&#39;re looking over another and you see</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.529" end="00:10:17.709" style="s2">a land beyond it to actually get to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.269" end="00:10:19.269" style="s2">land you have to go down the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.709" end="00:10:20.649" style="s2">first and then you can&#39;t quite see where</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.269" end="00:10:22.660" style="s2">you&#39;re going and and you&#39;re into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.649" end="00:10:25.480" style="s2">darkness again but then up again right</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.660" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">and so you talk about the J curve like</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.480" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">things have to get worse before they get</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:30.939" style="s2">better right and what do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:33.250" style="s2">are my friend I think we I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.939" end="00:10:35.649" style="s2">on the downward curve and my friend Nick</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.250" end="00:10:37.449" style="s2">jankle talks about the J curve because</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.649" end="00:10:41.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re sort of say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.449" end="00:10:43.540" style="s2">kind of things are going ok in order for</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.079" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">them to get better you have to destroy</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.540" end="00:10:48.309" style="s2">the things that are just about okay like</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:49.569" style="s2">you&#39;re coping like it think about in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.309" end="00:10:50.920" style="s2">your own life your coping strategies</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.569" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">your ego structures your way of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.920" end="00:10:56.139" style="s2">with things often you&#39;ll reach a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">where those don&#39;t work anymore and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.139" end="00:10:59.620" style="s2">ultimate solution is that you&#39;re you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:02.439" style="s2">come out of it and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.620" end="00:11:05.679" style="s2">healthier space you&#39;ll find some ways of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.439" end="00:11:06.970" style="s2">kind of yeah some of those believe some</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.679" end="00:11:08.889" style="s2">of those habits and they long serving</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.970" end="00:11:10.750" style="s2">you but to get to that place you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.889" end="00:11:12.080" style="s2">go down into it and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.750" end="00:11:15.710" style="s2">heading down into it the line</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.080" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">I don&#39;t think I think the election of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.710" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">Trump was the for me at least the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:24.710" style="s2">of harbinger of of that sense of okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:28.490" style="s2">this is the time it was something yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.710" end="00:11:30.950" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s kind of okay this is the time</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.490" end="00:11:33.500" style="s2">where things like he&#39;s whether you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.950" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">support him or not and I know that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.500" end="00:11:40.490" style="s2">got some some people who view our videos</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:42.770" style="s2">who do support him I I think supporting</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.490" end="00:11:44.840" style="s2">or not it&#39;s kind of a fairly narrow way</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.770" end="00:11:47.480" style="s2">of looking at it I see him as essential</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.840" end="00:11:51.350" style="s2">like he&#39;s a kind of he&#39;s a symptom with</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.480" end="00:11:53.900" style="s2">a cause and he&#39;s a symptom of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.350" end="00:11:59.060" style="s2">failure in the system over an awfully</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.900" end="00:12:00.620" style="s2">long time and he I mean even just from a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.060" end="00:12:02.000" style="s2">sort of practical level but he&#39;s ripping</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.620" end="00:12:03.770" style="s2">up all of the international agreements</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.000" end="00:12:05.780" style="s2">he&#39;s ripping up the entire kind of world</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.770" end="00:12:07.850" style="s2">order that was set up after the second</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.780" end="00:12:09.410" style="s2">world war by people who went through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.850" end="00:12:12.590" style="s2">Second World War and realized how bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.410" end="00:12:14.750" style="s2">things could get right and what we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.590" end="00:12:16.250" style="s2">now 70 years on is we&#39;ve lost all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.750" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">life experience of people who went</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.250" end="00:12:22.040" style="s2">through that so I suspect we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:23.630" style="s2">go through something similar hmm yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.040" end="00:12:25.070" style="s2">ibly yeah I think we&#39;ll go through</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.630" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">something similar in the next sort of 10</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.070" end="00:12:28.010" style="s2">years or so and in terms of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:30.850" style="s2">exponential curve and what it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.010" end="00:12:35.450" style="s2">I think it looks a bit like BitTorrent</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.850" end="00:12:37.700" style="s2">so BitTorrent is you have you start off</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:40.070" style="s2">with one one central node which has all</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.700" end="00:12:42.200" style="s2">the information and then it propagates</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.070" end="00:12:44.300" style="s2">out to everyone but then from everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.200" end="00:12:46.340" style="s2">to everyone at the same time yep so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.300" end="00:12:48.920" style="s2">think that&#39;s kind of how it works right</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.340" end="00:12:52.610" style="s2">and what&#39;s important is actually what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.920" end="00:12:55.850" style="s2">the process or movement that is most</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.610" end="00:12:58.310" style="s2">adaptive for that well that for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.850" end="00:13:00.890" style="s2">individuals who are then the the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.310" end="00:13:04.010" style="s2">nodes sprung out from the first node and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.890" end="00:13:06.290" style="s2">how how in their own development do they</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.010" end="00:13:07.880" style="s2">relate to the adaptive movement of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.290" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">initial node then we could tie this in</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:10.490" style="s2">together actually with what you just</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:12.110" style="s2">mentioned about Trump because for sure</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.490" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">he&#39;s a symptom but he&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.110" end="00:13:16.040" style="s2">individual and a powerful individual and</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:18.860" style="s2">is a course in his own right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.040" end="00:13:21.980" style="s2">the thing about Trump is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.860" end="00:13:24.620" style="s2">make arguments for his necessity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.980" end="00:13:27.140" style="s2">current systemic place we&#39;re in but at</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.620" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">the same time it&#39;s it&#39;s immediately</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.140" end="00:13:33.130" style="s2">apparent for most people what his</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">individual flaws are and and how he is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.130" end="00:13:39.620" style="s2">yeah I mean perhaps not in control of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:41.390" style="s2">what he could be you know as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.620" end="00:13:43.550" style="s2">might imagine an integrated individual</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.390" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">to be so something I&#39;m particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.550" end="00:13:51.590" style="s2">interested in is how is how the cycle</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:53.180" style="s2">plays out in an individual life and</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.590" end="00:13:56.420" style="s2">there&#39;s also a way to tie rationality</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.180" end="00:13:58.010" style="s2">and this other kind of mystical way into</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.420" end="00:13:59.990" style="s2">this as well I mean one way you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.010" end="00:14:02.540" style="s2">think about mysticism is out is as a way</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.990" end="00:14:04.790" style="s2">of seeing right is as the place from</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.540" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">from where it Givens emerge right but</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.790" end="00:14:09.800" style="s2">they may or may not be adaptive for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:11.690" style="s2">current framework we&#39;re all in so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.800" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">have to apply analysis and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.690" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">to work out what&#39;s going on in there but</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">fundamentally you have to empty that out</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:22.340" style="s2">again and then to resubmit</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:25.190" style="s2">back into that domain that enables the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.340" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">the the seeing of novelty from wherever</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.190" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">you are I mean there&#39;s a lots of ways to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">explore those ideas in a more articulate</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:40.550" style="s2">way but I do see that interplay as being</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:44.030" style="s2">particularly involved in what we see</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.550" end="00:14:47.750" style="s2">Jordan Peterson do you know he&#39;s someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.030" end="00:14:49.940" style="s2">to me that is he&#39;s a he&#39;s a creative</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.750" end="00:14:53.620" style="s2">thinker first and foremost but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.940" end="00:14:57.380" style="s2">a obviously a scientist you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.620" end="00:15:00.890" style="s2">well he&#39;s he&#39;s capable of pissing off</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.380" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">just about anyone because he has</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.890" end="00:15:06.380" style="s2">developed quite an idiosyncratic way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:09.250" style="s2">thinking even though it&#39;s got a lineage</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.380" end="00:15:11.330" style="s2">it has a real lineage and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.250" end="00:15:14.180" style="s2">perhaps one of the things he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.330" end="00:15:16.940" style="s2">that&#39;s most novel is sought in sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.180" end="00:15:18.620" style="s2">stack on top of one another many levels</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.940" end="00:15:21.320" style="s2">of analysis that attempt to represent</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.620" end="00:15:23.510" style="s2">the same pattern but nevertheless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:26.120" style="s2">Reap articular izing these fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.510" end="00:15:27.950" style="s2">ideas to terminology that works for him</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.120" end="00:15:29.750" style="s2">is a creative act itself which it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.950" end="00:15:31.550" style="s2">depends how deep you ultimately think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.750" end="00:15:32.960" style="s2">our creativity can go if we&#39;re just left</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.550" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">with three particular izing some</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.960" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">ultimately really fundamental like some</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:39.310" style="s2">sort of cycle of death and rebirth we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:44.690" style="s2">could talk about that a number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.310" end="00:15:46.550" style="s2">or can we transcend to some domain a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.690" end="00:15:48.230" style="s2">real radical novelty that&#39;s even it</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:51.110" style="s2">quite impossible to comprehend but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.230" end="00:15:53.210" style="s2">anyway where we might take all of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.110" end="00:15:56.270" style="s2">is what is the right way to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.210" end="00:15:59.420" style="s2">even a conversation about that right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.270" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">for me it&#39;s one that is based on on</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.420" end="00:16:06.260" style="s2">honesty fundamentally and and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:08.930" style="s2">and what I see in what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.260" end="00:16:11.410" style="s2">do with rebel wisdom is to approach</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.930" end="00:16:16.820" style="s2">difficult conversations with honesty</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.410" end="00:16:18.230" style="s2">that&#39;s really number one so there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.820" end="00:16:20.620" style="s2">suppose another element to this as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.230" end="00:16:23.090" style="s2">which is taking from the online sphere</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.620" end="00:16:25.400" style="s2">which is where the communication happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.090" end="00:16:29.570" style="s2">on the mass level but also actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.400" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">properly setting that up in in real life</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.570" end="00:16:35.150" style="s2">face-to-face life so I wonder about your</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:37.610" style="s2">vision for events in the future and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.150" end="00:16:39.260" style="s2">how it can work for people to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.610" end="00:16:41.030" style="s2">properly involved is the audience like</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.260" end="00:16:42.500" style="s2">how much audience interaction should</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.030" end="00:16:43.880" style="s2">there be should people be spitting off</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.500" end="00:16:45.350" style="s2">and having conversations in smaller</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.880" end="00:16:47.240" style="s2">groups obviously it&#39;s important we see</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.350" end="00:16:48.740" style="s2">to you know a couple people at the front</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.240" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">talking to each other but fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.740" end="00:16:53.740" style="s2">people have to engage themselves like</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:55.910" style="s2">like you say so what is the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.740" end="00:16:58.280" style="s2">spiraling noddle like structure that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.910" end="00:17:00.230" style="s2">best gets people to be involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.280" end="00:17:01.820" style="s2">creative transformative process I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.230" end="00:17:05.300" style="s2">know the answer to that question really</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.820" end="00:17:08.060" style="s2">no and I think with our next podcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.300" end="00:17:11.060" style="s2">we&#39;re going to inaugurate a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.060" end="00:17:13.330" style="s2">group or something on Facebook mm-hmm we</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.060" end="00:17:16.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the format is I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.330" end="00:17:19.190" style="s2">partly we have to facilitate in person</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.130" end="00:17:22.190" style="s2">discussions because broadcast is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.190" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">good enough to to be able to provide the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.190" end="00:17:27.290" style="s2">context and the kind of body language</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:29.000" style="s2">the kind of receptivity that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.290" end="00:17:34.760" style="s2">what happened to have cele dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.000" end="00:17:37.870" style="s2">each other but I think yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.760" end="00:17:41.060" style="s2">going to have to be continually</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.870" end="00:17:42.250" style="s2">decentralized there can be its own</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.060" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">holding the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.250" end="00:17:47.390" style="s2">decentralization but not chaos</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.420" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">and at the moment at the moment what</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.390" end="00:17:50.990" style="s2">decentralized and often means is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.280" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">a value what it comes with is a value</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.990" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">system of relativity right so or</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">relativism rather right so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:58.820" style="s2">reintroduce and this is do you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">spiral dynamics there&#39;s called Ken</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.820" end="00:18:04.100" style="s2">Wilber idea I probably am familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">the concepts but you might have quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.100" end="00:18:08.650" style="s2">useful map because he talks about green</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.640" style="s2">consciousness being postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.650" end="00:18:12.020" style="s2">relativistic it&#39;s the sort of dominant</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.640" end="00:18:14.630" style="s2">form of consciousness on the planet at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.020" end="00:18:16.580" style="s2">the moment and and the crisis we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:17.150" style="s2">seeing is because it&#39;s basically eating</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.580" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">its own tail</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.150" end="00:18:22.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a necessary step to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:24.170" style="s2">relativize absolutist claims and realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.610" end="00:18:26.210" style="s2">that there is a sort of there are there</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.170" end="00:18:28.070" style="s2">are other perspectives and it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.210" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">to consider other perspectives but</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.070" end="00:18:32.930" style="s2">ultimately if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:35.090" style="s2">transcendental truth value within it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.930" end="00:18:36.020" style="s2">then you just end up kind of in in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.090" end="00:18:38.870" style="s2">chaos that we&#39;re seeing at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.020" end="00:18:40.730" style="s2">yeah man we see a post truth world so he</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.870" end="00:18:43.130" style="s2">talks about integral thinking being the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.730" end="00:18:45.880" style="s2">level above green an integral thinking</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.130" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">reintroduces hierarchy it reintroduces</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.880" end="00:18:52.540" style="s2">it reintroduces truth that reintroduces</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">hierarchy and it reintroduces yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.540" end="00:18:56.930" style="s2">bypasses a lot of the pathologies of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:18:58.760" style="s2">previous stages and i thought i thought</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.930" end="00:19:00.890" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s only a map but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.760" end="00:19:02.840" style="s2">quite a useful map I think and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.890" end="00:19:05.510" style="s2">really recommend there&#39;s a book called</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.840" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">Trump in the post truth world which Ken</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.510" end="00:19:08.630" style="s2">Wilber wrote after the election of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:10.810" style="s2">that&#39;s really good because it it applies</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.630" end="00:19:13.430" style="s2">this what can be quite esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.810" end="00:19:15.740" style="s2">theorizing is integral theory to real</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.430" end="00:19:18.430" style="s2">world events and it really explains</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.740" end="00:19:21.740" style="s2">what&#39;s going on basically Green</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.430" end="00:19:23.930" style="s2">relativism identity politics stopped</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.740" end="00:19:25.670" style="s2">functioning as a leading edge so what</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.930" end="00:19:27.890" style="s2">happens is we&#39;ve rebooted to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.670" end="00:19:29.270" style="s2">earlier stage of tribalism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.890" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">what Trump represents that&#39;s what breaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.270" end="00:19:34.010" style="s2">that represents and it&#39;s a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.990" style="s2">thing to happen because this these sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.010" end="00:19:37.010" style="s2">of so-called liberal elites were</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.990" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">basically going off on their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.010" end="00:19:41.420" style="s2">direction and secretly hating all of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:43.940" style="s2">people that didn&#39;t think the same as</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.420" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">them so this is kind of ideology of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.940" end="00:19:47.180" style="s2">openness</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:49.610" style="s2">we&#39;re so open to all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.180" end="00:19:51.320" style="s2">kind of ideas and perspectives and races</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.610" end="00:19:53.300" style="s2">and genders and sexualities apart from</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.320" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">those people who don&#39;t think like after</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.300" end="00:19:56.780" style="s2">these traditionalists who have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">different attitudes towards a gay</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.780" end="00:20:01.820" style="s2">marriage or whatever their bigoted and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:03.160" style="s2">racist and homophobic and we do so this</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.820" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">this sort of there was this hidden</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.160" end="00:20:11.810" style="s2">shadow of liberal superiority and hate</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:14.120" style="s2">that lots of people picked up on</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.810" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">especially I mean obviously brexit as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.120" end="00:20:19.820" style="s2">example in the UK and Trump as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:25.040" style="s2">example in in America where in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.820" end="00:20:27.290" style="s2">for example they&#39;re quite valid concerns</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.040" end="00:20:29.050" style="s2">about uncontrolled immigration are seen</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.290" end="00:20:33.410" style="s2">by the liberal by the sort of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.050" end="00:20:35.030" style="s2">left as racist and bigoted and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.410" end="00:20:36.830" style="s2">the and they&#39;re generally these people</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.030" end="00:20:39.350" style="s2">don&#39;t live in the areas that are really</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.830" end="00:20:42.770" style="s2">affected by these by this immigration</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.350" end="00:20:45.170" style="s2">yeah and so what you had is in with</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.770" end="00:20:47.990" style="s2">Breck&#39;s and with Trump they were given a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.170" end="00:20:50.180" style="s2">button marked you and enough people</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.990" end="00:20:51.650" style="s2">pressed oh they press a button yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.180" end="00:20:55.460" style="s2">and I don&#39;t blame them for it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.650" end="00:20:59.630" style="s2">likely exactly and I think it&#39;s a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.460" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">of Western culture to crisis of the UK</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.630" end="00:21:04.280" style="s2">and a crisis of America to say you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:06.590" style="s2">allow your your country to get too far</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.280" end="00:21:08.180" style="s2">ahead of itself if you kind of see it as</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.590" end="00:21:10.490" style="s2">sort of more or less of all than I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.180" end="00:21:13.610" style="s2">I I don&#39;t particularly but it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.490" end="00:21:14.930" style="s2">the divisions get too broad you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.610" end="00:21:16.370" style="s2">stop and come back together and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.930" end="00:21:18.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a healing that needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.370" end="00:21:22.580" style="s2">in both the UK and the u.s. that at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.950" end="00:21:24.530" style="s2">moment I don&#39;t see happening because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.580" end="00:21:26.240" style="s2">Liberals seem to have doubled down on</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.530" end="00:21:27.740" style="s2">their Wow</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:29.060" style="s2">Trump got elected the country is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.740" end="00:21:31.070" style="s2">far worse than we thought it&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.060" end="00:21:32.840" style="s2">racing more racist than we thought far</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.070" end="00:21:33.920" style="s2">more homophone and slightly look look at</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.840" end="00:21:35.870" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening look at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.920" end="00:21:38.600" style="s2">reception of someone like milo who</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.870" end="00:21:41.450" style="s2">openly gay talks about his black</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.600" end="00:21:45.050" style="s2">boyfriend got in rural america these are</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.450" end="00:21:46.490" style="s2">not these are not just the sort of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.050" end="00:21:48.380" style="s2">sure there are racist and homophobic</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.490" end="00:21:49.040" style="s2">people there but this is not what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.380" end="00:21:51.590" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.040" end="00:21:54.620" style="s2">and this liberal what I fear is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.590" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">we&#39;re actually we&#39;re actually seeing its</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.620" end="00:22:00.500" style="s2">spiral further rather than this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:03.050" style="s2">healing that needs to happen and I my</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.500" end="00:22:05.000" style="s2">belief is that it might be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.050" end="00:22:06.830" style="s2">have these this is what the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.000" end="00:22:08.090" style="s2">dialogue is about as well as hope there</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.830" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">are certain conversations that we need</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.090" end="00:22:09.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:12.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re being stopped at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.800" end="00:22:15.050" style="s2">by this ideology the conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.440" end="00:22:16.550" style="s2">gender differences for example are being</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.050" end="00:22:18.260" style="s2">stopped because of this ideology that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.550" end="00:22:20.000" style="s2">says you can&#39;t talk about that or that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.260" end="00:22:22.220" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s even it&#39;s sexist to even</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.000" end="00:22:23.900" style="s2">discuss it and there&#39;s all of these sort</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.220" end="00:22:26.780" style="s2">of third-rail issues within our culture</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.900" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">that that this worldview is stopping us</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.780" end="00:22:29.990" style="s2">discussing and the intellectual diet</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:31.910" style="s2">will be sort of this first</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.750" end="00:22:49.790" style="s2">conversation needs to be had I suspect</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.270" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">well you if you keep pursuing targets</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.330" end="00:26:21.920" style="s2">for the sake of targets people learn to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:23.809" style="s2">kind of deep the stats but not to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.920" end="00:26:25.580" style="s2">actually do their jobs and so what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.809" end="00:26:28.670" style="s2">have is a society that&#39;s not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.580" end="00:26:30.440" style="s2">for itself it&#39;s doing it for for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.670" end="00:26:33.649" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.440" end="00:26:35.330" style="s2">it&#39;s meeting the the targets without</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.649" end="00:26:37.789" style="s2">actually doing like a policeman is not</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.330" end="00:26:39.889" style="s2">doing his job because he wants to bring</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.789" end="00:26:41.149" style="s2">yeah from the best part of himself he</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.889" end="00:26:43.429" style="s2">wants to serve his country what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.149" end="00:26:45.769" style="s2">service Society in the end even if it</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.429" end="00:26:46.789" style="s2">gets into it for that he ends up busting</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.769" end="00:26:48.649" style="s2">people on the street corners because</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.789" end="00:26:51.769" style="s2">he&#39;ll it&#39;s much quicker to to get his</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.649" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">stats so what you end up is hollowing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.769" end="00:26:55.429" style="s2">out of society and I think America&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.590" style="s2">kind of there already it&#39;s an outdated</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.429" end="00:26:59.149" style="s2">image in other words the people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.590" end="00:27:00.799" style="s2">aspiring to something aspiring to</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.809" end="00:27:10.009" style="s2">current world well it&#39;s sort of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.789" end="00:27:11.929" style="s2">they&#39;ve I think they&#39;ve sacrificed truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.009" end="00:27:13.759" style="s2">at a fairly fundamental level</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.929" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">and you can&#39;t sacrifice truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.759" end="00:27:19.429" style="s2">society and expect to get away with it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:23.179" style="s2">mm-hmm so yeah on the on the quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.429" end="00:27:25.399" style="s2">reasonable assumption that the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.179" end="00:27:27.799" style="s2">continuing to deteriorate to a point of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.399" end="00:27:33.850" style="s2">utter chaos is a very very very bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.799" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">thing well that&#39;s not in a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.850" end="00:27:39.159" style="s2">Association of good and bad is part of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">the problem well okay okay but you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.159" end="00:27:45.409" style="s2">we are at this point where a scale so</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">scary weapons is suck everything it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.409" end="00:27:49.490" style="s2">of course it&#39;s scary but it also depends</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:52.639" style="s2">what we mean by chaos and one person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.490" end="00:27:54.860" style="s2">chaos is is going to be a grain of sand</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.639" end="00:27:59.179" style="s2">in comparison to someone else&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.860" end="00:28:01.669" style="s2">we&#39;re so powerful that it&#39;s it is well</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.179" end="00:28:03.019" style="s2">by the nature of chaos impossible really</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.669" end="00:28:05.659" style="s2">to fix exactly what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.019" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">here so it&#39;s scary we might want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.659" end="00:28:12.080" style="s2">avoid it as long as that&#39;s not papering</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:17.419" style="s2">over cracks that might mean ways to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.080" end="00:28:19.700" style="s2">properly navigate conflict and now in in</p>

<p begin="00:28:28.009" end="00:28:36.039" style="s2">bit out of my depth but I can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.049" end="00:28:41.860" style="s2">in times when I&#39;ve been able to bridge</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.460" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">in one sense is a cliched thing to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.770" end="00:28:53.770" style="s2">but at other times it can appear like</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:55.570" style="s2">the most salient and most real thing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.770" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">say there is when you want psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.570" end="00:28:59.260" style="s2">for example when you&#39;re on psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:04.360" style="s2">for example but but but also I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.260" end="00:29:06.340" style="s2">actually more more repeatedly you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.360" end="00:29:08.710" style="s2">in a romantic relationship or in a</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.710" end="00:29:13.240" style="s2">know in a friendship you know I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.420" end="00:29:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot for the potential of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.240" end="00:29:20.130" style="s2">could be at the same time as also</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">allowing a sort of relaxing into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.130" end="00:29:25.510" style="s2">satisfaction somehow with the present</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:29.530" style="s2">despite what moments before was</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.510" end="00:29:33.100" style="s2">suffering I mean so love is a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.530" end="00:29:36.970" style="s2">maker of sorts but there&#39;s a as a great</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.750" end="00:31:17.690" style="s2">I would also argue that fundamentally</p>

<p begin="00:31:21.740" end="00:31:25.880" style="s2">course all I mean I will argue for it</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.140" end="00:31:28.130" style="s2">though and the reason I will say that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.880" end="00:31:29.960" style="s2">because now maybe you&#39;re right the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.130" end="00:31:32.120" style="s2">reason I will say that is because to be</p>

<p begin="00:31:32.120" end="00:31:37.220" style="s2">of it you have to be absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:32:08.630" end="00:32:11.990" style="s2">right there&#39;s a meaning in suffering but</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.740" end="00:32:43.310" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s currently maintaining</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.420" end="00:32:45.170" style="s2">that even people who profess to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.310" end="00:32:47.210" style="s2">atheists are in fact religious if they</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.710" end="00:33:00.110" style="s2">optimistic take right the choice to live</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.530" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">is an optimistic take so you might think</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.110" end="00:33:04.850" style="s2">that for me I think the beginning place</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.480" end="00:33:06.310" style="s2">for philosophy is should I live and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.850" end="00:33:08.290" style="s2">do have a choice</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.310" end="00:33:09.820" style="s2">it seems to me and I will argue for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.290" end="00:33:13.000" style="s2">genuine choice</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.820" end="00:33:16.090" style="s2">despite I very much closed boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.000" end="00:33:17.380" style="s2">and limits on our choice but it is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.090" end="00:33:19.630" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s and it&#39;s not a rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.380" end="00:33:22.450" style="s2">principle you know it&#39;s an affirmation</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.630" end="00:33:24.130" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s an affectation and the</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.130" end="00:33:27.850" style="s2">anyway I see them all as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.870" end="00:33:30.220" style="s2">same process you if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.850" end="00:33:33.310" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done that is remotely helpful</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.310" end="00:33:38.380" style="s2">merely put in this metaphor forward for</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.880" end="00:33:39.970" style="s2">the destruction building it into</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.380" end="00:33:43.060" style="s2">something better presumably but it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:33:49.330" end="00:33:54.550" style="s2">and you&#39;ll have destroyed what it is so</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.830" end="00:34:12.280" style="s2">making I call it that&#39;s the analysis</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.280" end="00:34:16.600" style="s2">for the whole structure it up turns its</p>

<p begin="00:34:18.220" end="00:34:21.640" style="s2">links up with the idea of nodes as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.660" end="00:34:23.410" style="s2">what&#39;s the appropriate way to actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.640" end="00:34:25.750" style="s2">empty yourself of the water while</p>

<p begin="00:34:33.340" end="00:34:39.520" style="s2">re-enter the water but fundamentally the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.760" end="00:34:41.830" style="s2">movement comes from the hitting of the</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.830" end="00:34:47.380" style="s2">casks there and for me the affirmation</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.930" end="00:34:50.470" style="s2">of life is is is is optimistic and it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.380" end="00:34:51.940" style="s2">an embodied precognitive choice I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.470" end="00:34:53.800" style="s2">really use the word precognitive because</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.940" end="00:34:56.080" style="s2">I&#39;m not educated enough to really talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.800" end="00:34:57.550" style="s2">about what cognitive means in modern</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.080" end="00:34:59.160" style="s2">cognitive science but it looks to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.550" end="00:35:01.720" style="s2">like something precognitive and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.160" end="00:35:04.150" style="s2">in a psychedelic experience we can get</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.720" end="00:35:06.910" style="s2">this orientation of how to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.150" end="00:35:09.130" style="s2">before things become too fixed right we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.910" end="00:35:11.470" style="s2">meet anomaly and we can think of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.130" end="00:35:13.270" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s chaos in order to help grasp</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.470" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">this concept of it anomaly is what</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.270" end="00:35:16.369" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re out there in chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a moment you can call it an</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.369" end="00:35:19.460" style="s2">encounter right and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:21.799" style="s2">decision as to how you respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.460" end="00:35:23.839" style="s2">and there&#39;s there would be many brake</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.799" end="00:35:25.369" style="s2">offs you know of how we can then talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.839" end="00:35:26.749" style="s2">about that but fundamentally it&#39;s pay</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.369" end="00:35:28.519" style="s2">attention to it or not and there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.749" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">positive and negative senses of both but</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.519" end="00:35:35.869" style="s2">anyway you know it is a it is for me for</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">me these are ideas that are all linked</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.869" end="00:35:41.950" style="s2">to what we&#39;re seeing and fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.640" end="00:35:45.229" style="s2">as well it&#39;s about it&#39;s an instance of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.950" end="00:35:47.630" style="s2">sort of oppositional nature we we&#39;ve air</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.229" end="00:35:49.009" style="s2">out in ourselves and we see play out in</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.630" end="00:35:51.589" style="s2">the world of course you have left them</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.009" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">right you have the internal the AB the X</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.589" end="00:35:57.890" style="s2">I know you have materialism and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:36:01.420" style="s2">else you want to say you know and it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.890" end="00:36:05.509" style="s2">that it is that appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.420" end="00:36:08.660" style="s2">harmonization of opposites to dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.509" end="00:36:11.839" style="s2">them but to coagulate them again to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.660" end="00:36:14.420" style="s2">bring them together again right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.839" end="00:36:17.059" style="s2">about taking away the polarities it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.420" end="00:36:18.589" style="s2">about it&#39;s about engaging in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.059" end="00:36:20.630" style="s2">individual action as it meets the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.589" end="00:36:24.729" style="s2">collective that appropriately Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.630" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">right that oppositional motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.729" end="00:36:29.089" style="s2">reconstitutes it so it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.739" style="s2">properly harmonized for whatever is but</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.089" end="00:36:32.180" style="s2">you know adaptive for the time but</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.739" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s so abstract what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.180" end="00:36:36.349" style="s2">you know to embody it and talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:37.700" style="s2">and engage with these ideas that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.349" end="00:36:39.529" style="s2">we see it come out in gender and</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.700" end="00:36:43.219" style="s2">what-have-you but because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.529" end="00:36:44.989" style="s2">you know people can grapple on to these</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.219" end="00:36:47.539" style="s2">sorts of things a little bit and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.989" end="00:36:49.489" style="s2">a conversation I do want to have but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.539" end="00:36:50.539" style="s2">not educated to have to the standard</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.489" end="00:36:52.759" style="s2">that I think is required if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.539" end="00:36:54.710" style="s2">ultimately want to try and lead people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.759" end="00:36:56.809" style="s2">through with such a ridiculous chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.710" end="00:36:58.609" style="s2">time but I see it&#39;s something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.809" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">taking on and I really admire that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.609" end="00:37:02.259" style="s2">think it takes a lot of bravery I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:05.089" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing it takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.259" end="00:37:07.210" style="s2">bravery and vulnerability and I I do see</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.089" end="00:37:09.890" style="s2">that and you know the reason why I</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:11.950" style="s2">contacted you was because I won I</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.890" end="00:37:14.359" style="s2">thought you&#39;d say yes and partly because</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.950" end="00:37:17.469" style="s2">well I just had a sense that the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.359" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">was right but also you know because</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.469" end="00:37:23.329" style="s2">because uh because uh you would be ready</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:25.510" style="s2">to have a conversation I see it with</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.329" end="00:37:27.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.510" end="00:37:28.849" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know what would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.920" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">talk about would you like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.849" end="00:37:34.670" style="s2">your men&#39;s work I mean because that if</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:36.260" style="s2">that is somewhere where you have from my</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.670" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">limited understanding sort of</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:54.980" style="s2">fundamentally what&#39;s what&#39;s confusing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.430" end="00:37:56.539" style="s2">about ourselves when we look in and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.980" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">can call that the shadow and then below</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:01.700" style="s2">want to be young in about it and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.900" end="00:38:03.500" style="s2">have various complexes of the personal</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.700" end="00:38:05.569" style="s2">unconscious as well and it&#39;s so so</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.500" end="00:38:07.730" style="s2">complicated but how do you conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.569" end="00:38:08.930" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing there and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.730" end="00:38:13.010" style="s2">what do you want to how do you want to</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.010" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">were starting the men&#39;s work kind of at</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.890" end="00:38:21.500" style="s2">the same time as the media stuff it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:25.010" style="s2">sort of a coincidence that I happen to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.500" end="00:38:28.069" style="s2">be being mentored via a guy who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.010" end="00:38:30.260" style="s2">doing this work since the 70s and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.069" end="00:38:33.020" style="s2">think I mean I see it in a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.260" end="00:38:35.089" style="s2">because what we need to do is to really</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.020" end="00:38:37.190" style="s2">ground ourselves in ourselves that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.089" end="00:38:40.190" style="s2">where we need to go as well right now</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.190" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">and that for me involves there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.190" end="00:38:43.730" style="s2">something that happens when men are with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:46.730" style="s2">men and women are with women that is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.730" end="00:38:49.339" style="s2">really essential grounding and AB in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.730" end="00:38:52.099" style="s2">sort of deeper being a polarity that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.339" end="00:38:54.650" style="s2">then it gives us fuel mm-hmm and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.099" end="00:38:55.880" style="s2">about vitamin M on our workshops the</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.650" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">idea that there&#39;s something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.880" end="00:39:00.319" style="s2">craving I think it&#39;s a deep evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:02.390" style="s2">history of men with men with men and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.319" end="00:39:06.049" style="s2">there is something that everyone there</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.390" end="00:39:07.730" style="s2">feels on a really deep level when when</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.049" end="00:39:10.579" style="s2">they&#39;re in that space and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.730" end="00:39:12.260" style="s2">something that when we really focus our</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.579" end="00:39:13.910" style="s2">intention on what&#39;s working in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.260" end="00:39:16.420" style="s2">what isn&#39;t working in our lives and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.910" end="00:39:20.299" style="s2">bring that level of intensity to it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.420" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">change can happen we need to I think in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.299" end="00:39:24.200" style="s2">our lives we need to kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.460" style="s2">artificially create that or artificially</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.200" end="00:39:28.490" style="s2">but we need to create that for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.460" end="00:39:30.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s what everyone who comes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.490" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">the workshops is bringing there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.500" end="00:39:33.990" style="s2">of real and we we kind of encourage them</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:35.580" style="s2">to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.990" end="00:39:37.350" style="s2">level of intensity it&#39;s like okay what</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.580" end="00:39:38.520" style="s2">are you what do you really want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.350" end="00:39:41.130" style="s2">happen in your life what do you really</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.520" end="00:39:43.820" style="s2">want to change and it&#39;s only with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.130" end="00:39:48.150" style="s2">level of intensity and that level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.820" end="00:39:50.010" style="s2">recognition and support that I think we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.150" end="00:39:51.330" style="s2">can make those changes it&#39;s very hard in</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.010" end="00:39:56.100" style="s2">our everyday lives without sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.330" end="00:39:58.860" style="s2">carving out a space for it and we also</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.100" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">say we have to do it ourselves we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.860" end="00:40:03.000" style="s2">have to do it alone so there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:05.970" style="s2">of sort of community and support and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.000" end="00:40:09.180" style="s2">really willing each other to become the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.970" end="00:40:12.570" style="s2">best we can be and that is something I</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.180" end="00:40:15.060" style="s2">think yeah I think men with other men</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.570" end="00:40:16.410" style="s2">find it a lot easier to give that than</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.060" end="00:40:18.360" style="s2">when women are present because when</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.410" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">women are present there often comes in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.360" end="00:40:22.080" style="s2">bit of performance a bit of anxiety a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:23.940" style="s2">bit of sort of showing off in front of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.080" end="00:40:29.190" style="s2">the other man there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.940" end="00:40:31.020" style="s2">something that comes in that that is is</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.190" end="00:40:35.730" style="s2">a different element into that field</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.020" end="00:40:40.650" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s not wrong we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.730" end="00:40:42.330" style="s2">have a really sure there&#39;s a lot of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.650" end="00:40:44.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a different energy to a mixed</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.330" end="00:40:46.609" style="s2">group absolutely but there is something</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.580" end="00:40:49.440" style="s2">that being with men allows us to really</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.609" end="00:40:52.830" style="s2">support each other and focus and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:55.140" style="s2">recharge ourselves for our relationships</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.830" end="00:40:57.960" style="s2">or for Rhian gauging with with with</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.140" end="00:41:00.570" style="s2">women in the outside world or you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.960" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">just just really yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.570" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">essential piece and I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:07.290" style="s2">essential piece for now because of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:10.020" style="s2">chaos of the times we have to ground</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.290" end="00:41:14.310" style="s2">ourselves in ourselves I think as men</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.020" end="00:41:18.270" style="s2">that means grounding ourselves as men as</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.310" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">well as as people because we have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.270" end="00:41:23.730" style="s2">biological existence we have any we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:26.220" style="s2">a an embodied existence absolutely and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.730" end="00:41:29.070" style="s2">lot of men I know from my generation</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.220" end="00:41:31.080" style="s2">have a sense of sort of shame around</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.070" end="00:41:32.550" style="s2">themselves as men and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.080" end="00:41:34.859" style="s2">that in a culture and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.550" end="00:41:37.560" style="s2">men have internalized themselves that</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.859" end="00:41:39.570" style="s2">about themselves and nothing good comes</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.560" end="00:41:42.450" style="s2">from shame it&#39;s not an empowered space</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.570" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">to be it&#39;s it&#39;s essential for us to kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.450" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">of recognize the way that men have</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:50.400" style="s2">misbehaved in the past</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:51.060" style="s2">but it&#39;s not for us to take on if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.400" end="00:41:54.090" style="s2">not ours</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.060" end="00:41:57.420" style="s2">and it&#39;s to say I take what&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.090" end="00:41:59.010" style="s2">mm-hmm I reject what&#39;s not mine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.420" end="00:42:06.270" style="s2">being put onto me</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.010" end="00:42:08.730" style="s2">and I I yeah I I become the best that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.270" end="00:42:10.620" style="s2">can be because I think yeah ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.730" end="00:42:12.570" style="s2">we&#39;re all being challenged to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.620" end="00:42:13.890" style="s2">that&#39;s what the times are calling for</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.570" end="00:42:18.450" style="s2">right now we&#39;re all gonna have to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.890" end="00:42:23.070" style="s2">and it&#39;s never easy all change is never</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.450" end="00:42:24.780" style="s2">easy but take it on willingly or it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.070" end="00:42:25.260" style="s2">happen to you anyway and it won&#39;t be so</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.780" end="00:42:27.240" style="s2">much fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.260" end="00:42:30.330" style="s2">yeah yeah I think that is the right</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.290" end="00:42:46.370" style="s2">it&#39;s motivated I think by by that app</p>
