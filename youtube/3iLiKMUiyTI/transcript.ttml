<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:20.029" style="s2">so I think the best way to continue to<br />walk you through the thinkers that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.029" end="00:00:25.830" style="s2">planning to cover is to do that with<br />examples they stick better and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.830" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">more interesting and it&#39;s very difficult<br />to understand you outside of a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:34.410" style="s2">context and so I&#39;m going to walk you<br />through the Lion King today how many of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.410" end="00:00:40.140" style="s2">you have seen the Lion King yes<br />so how many of you haven&#39;t right okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.140" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">so you obviously were raised in a box<br />somewhere out in the middle of field so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:50.520" style="s2">anyways you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an<br />amazingly popular animated movie I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.520" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">it was the most highest grossing<br />animated movie ever made made until</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">frozen which I actually absolutely<br />detested but the Lion King The Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">is actually consciously influenced by<br />archetypes as well as unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:07.140" style="s2">influenced by them so it&#39;s a bit of a<br />cheat I would say in some sense but it</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.140" end="00:01:10.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t for the purposes that<br />we&#39;re using it for I think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.740" end="00:01:17.490" style="s2">fine and so partly what you might think<br />about is that it&#39;s its relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.490" end="00:01:22.439" style="s2">archetypal themes that made it so<br />overwhelmingly popular it&#39;s same being</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.439" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">the case with say books and movies like<br />Harry Potter or the entire Marvel series</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">the Marvel series is quite interesting I<br />know somebody who wrote for Batman and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">for Wolverine I know Batman he&#39;s into<br />Marvel comic but one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:38.790" style="s2">he told me that was quite interesting<br />was that once these characters take off</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.790" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">and establish a life of their own they<br />have a backstory and which becomes part</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:46.500" style="s2">of the mythology that&#39;s collectively<br />held by the readers and if you you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.500" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">invent an alternative universe where you<br />can muck about with the backstory but</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:52.829" style="s2">otherwise you better stick with it or<br />the readers are gonna write you and tell</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.829" end="00:01:56.040" style="s2">you that you&#39;ve got the story wrong and<br />so there&#39;s a bit of a collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.040" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">between the writers and the readers<br />after these things take on a life of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">their own and so and of course the they<br />they tend to the the comic books in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">particular tend to tend towards<br />mythological themes very very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">and so anyways Carl Jung was a<br />fascinating person I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:18.300" style="s2">you can read his biography autobiography<br />/ biography which is called memories</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.300" end="00:02:21.990" style="s2">dreams and reflections which in many<br />ways I think is an unfortunate book</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.990" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s usually the only book that<br />people read that&#39;s that is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:30.990" style="s2">by young but and it is more popular yet<br />popularly accessible which is probably a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.990" end="00:02:37.170" style="s2">good thing but it&#39;s also it&#39;s not as<br />rigorous as his other books and so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.170" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">problem with someone like Jung is you<br />kind of have to read him as much as you</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:45.380" style="s2">can in the original because interpreting<br />him is not a very straightforward matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.380" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">he was a very visionary person by which<br />I mean he had an incredible visual</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">imagination and he used that a lot he<br />used it in his therapy practice I</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">believe that most of his therapy clients<br />were high in trade openness I have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">of clients who are high in trade<br />openness they kind of seek me out</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">because I&#39;m high and trade openness and<br />you know they watch my videos and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:09.560" style="s2">sort of thing and they&#39;re interested in<br />what I&#39;m doing and many of them are</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.560" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">astute dreamers and prolific dreamers<br />and many open people in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:18.420" style="s2">have archetypal dreams whereas people<br />who are lower in openness they either</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.420" end="00:03:21.930" style="s2">don&#39;t dream at all or they don&#39;t<br />remember their dreams as much or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.930" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">not interested in them and they&#39;re not<br />interested in the mythological</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">underpinnings of them so I&#39;ve taught<br />psychology roughly speaking to many</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:35.100" style="s2">different types of people including<br />lawyers and lawyers and physicians and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.100" end="00:03:38.489" style="s2">they tend to be higher in trade<br />conscientiousness than in openness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.489" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">they&#39;re much more interested in the<br />practical applications of psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:45.570" style="s2">maybe the big five theories than they<br />are in the narrative underpinnings and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.570" end="00:03:50.610" style="s2">you know people say that when they went<br />to um-- they had union dreams but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:53.850" style="s2">don&#39;t and then when they went to Freud<br />they had Freudian dreams and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.850" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">really believe that&#39;s exactly true I<br />think it was a matter of selection bias</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:01.049" style="s2">a priori selection bias on the part of<br />the people who were likely to go see</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.049" end="00:04:07.290" style="s2">either of those two and so but I&#39;ve been<br />struck by some clients in particular how</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.290" end="00:04:11.760" style="s2">unbelievably continually they can<br />generate deep archetypal dreams with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.760" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">really coherent narrative structure it&#39;s<br />really phenomenal and how revealing</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">those dreams our problem with archetypal<br />dreams is that they&#39;re not really</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:22.890" style="s2">personal right so if you&#39;re looking for<br />a personal way out of a situation an</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.890" end="00:04:26.130" style="s2">archetypal dream doesn&#39;t help you that<br />much because it gives you the general</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.130" end="00:04:28.770" style="s2">pattern rather<br />than a specific solution to your problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">but a good dream will do both at once<br />anyways yung was an astute student of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">Freud&#39;s I will cover Freud next although<br />generally and in personality courses the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:45.450" style="s2">the order is reversed Freud first<br />menuing because of their temporal of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.450" end="00:04:49.320" style="s2">temporal order of their thought but I<br />think it&#39;s better to start with Jung</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.320" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s as if you Freud<br />excavated into the basement and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">Jung excavated into many many floors<br />underneath the basement of the mind and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.440" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">so from if you&#39;re transitioning from an<br />archaic understanding of archaic modes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:07.170" style="s2">of thinking towards Freud it&#39;s better to<br />go through young because Jung is I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.170" end="00:05:11.700" style="s2">I think Freudian theory is a subset of<br />Jungian Theory fundamentally just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.700" end="00:05:16.410" style="s2">Newtonian physics is a subset of<br />Einstein Ian&#39;s physics and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.410" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">Freud knew that even to some degree<br />although he was very much opposed to any</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:24.540" style="s2">sort of religious thinking or<br />mythological religious thinking I would</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.540" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">say he was a real 19th century<br />materialist and he didn&#39;t like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.660" style="s2">that Jung&#39;s work started to delve into<br />religious themes in a manner that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.660" end="00:05:37.350" style="s2">actually in some sense validated those<br />themes and so that&#39;s actually why they</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.350" end="00:05:40.710" style="s2">split they split when you published a<br />book called symbols of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.710" end="00:05:44.790" style="s2">Jung was also a deep student of<br />Nietzsche Nietzsche wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.790" end="00:05:49.620" style="s2">thus spake Zarathustra which is kind of<br />an Old Testament revelation poetry kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.620" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">of book it&#39;s a strange one and I<br />wouldn&#39;t recommend if you want to read</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:57.900" style="s2">Nietzsche that you start with that one<br />but most people do but you get a seminar</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.900" end="00:06:02.340" style="s2">on thus spake Zarathustra which is about<br />I&#39;ve got this wrong it&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.340" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">between 700 and 1100 pages long and it<br />only covers the first third of the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">and thus spake Zarathustra is actually<br />quite a short book and so well so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:16.020" style="s2">can imagine how much you had to know<br />about Nietzsche to derive that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.020" end="00:06:20.540" style="s2">words out of that few words and<br />Nietzsche was a well an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.540" end="00:06:25.500" style="s2">absolute genius and Jung was actually<br />trying to answer the question that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.500" end="00:06:29.820" style="s2">Nietzsche posed fundamentally which is<br />why part of the reason why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.820" end="00:06:35.090" style="s2">incorrect historically to consider him a<br />Freudian he was so nietzsche basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.090" end="00:06:40.830" style="s2">stated let&#39;s say explicitly that<br />scientific empiricism / rationalist</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.830" end="00:06:44.460" style="s2">had resulted in the death of the<br />mythological tradition of the west</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.460" end="00:06:49.110" style="s2">roughly speaking that&#39;s Nietzsche&#39;s<br />comment on the death of God and in that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.110" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">comment he also said that the fact that<br />God was dead was going to produce</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:58.020" style="s2">tremendous idiy a tional and social<br />historical upheavals that would result</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.020" end="00:07:02.220" style="s2">in the deaths of millions of people that<br />that he didn&#39;t say all that in one place</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.220" end="00:07:07.919" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s spread between part of its in<br />will to power and and I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.919" end="00:07:11.330" style="s2">the source of the other one some of its<br />referenced and thus spake Zarathustra</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.330" end="00:07:16.139" style="s2">but Nietzsche believed that in order to<br />overcome the collapse of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.139" end="00:07:21.800" style="s2">values with the idea say of God as its<br />cornerstone people would have to become</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.800" end="00:07:26.250" style="s2">creatures that could produce their own<br />values as a replacement that we would</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.250" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">have to become capable of generating<br />autonomous values and Jung but but</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.219" style="s2">that&#39;s easier said than done because<br />trying to impose a set of values on</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.219" end="00:07:38.400" style="s2">yourself is very difficult because<br />you&#39;re not very cooperative and you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.400" end="00:07:41.069" style="s2">that if you try to get yourself to do<br />something that you don&#39;t want to do or</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.069" end="00:07:45.330" style="s2">that&#39;s hard you just won&#39;t do it and so<br />it&#39;s not like you can just invent your</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.330" end="00:07:48.870" style="s2">own values and then go along with that<br />that just doesn&#39;t work and so what Jung</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.870" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">and the Freudians did Freud first I<br />would say was to start looking to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:56.340" style="s2">looking into people&#39;s fantasies<br />autonomous fantasies unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.340" end="00:08:04.169" style="s2">fantasies to see if they could - and and<br />discover that values bubbled up of their</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.169" end="00:08:07.770" style="s2">own accord into those fantasies and you<br />can imagine for example if you&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.770" end="00:08:11.430" style="s2">enamored of someone that you might start<br />fantasizing about them and if you read</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.430" end="00:08:14.430" style="s2">off the fantasy then you can tell what<br />you&#39;re after and what you&#39;re up to and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.430" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">so the motivational force composes the<br />fantasy and Freud was more interested</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:24.270" style="s2">not in a personal sense so in in so far<br />as your fantasies might reveal your</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.270" end="00:08:28.110" style="s2">personal history so for example if you<br />have a burst of negative emotion in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.110" end="00:08:31.169" style="s2">clinical session there&#39;ll be a fantasy<br />that goes along with that an association</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.169" end="00:08:36.089" style="s2">of ideas that that that kind of manifest<br />themselves of their own accord and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.089" end="00:08:39.510" style="s2">they&#39;re not necessarily coherent and<br />logical they&#39;re linked by emotion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.510" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">the free association technique in<br />Freudian psychology and they also might</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:46.800" style="s2">manifest themselves in dreams and<br />fantasies and so Freud started doing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.800" end="00:08:52.020" style="s2">analysis of these spontaneous let&#39;s call<br />them fantasies and Jung link that more</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.020" end="00:08:54.750" style="s2">at Freud did this first with the oedipal<br />oedipal</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.750" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">complex but then you linked up<br />spontaneous fantasies and dreams with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:03.300" style="s2">with myth mythology and fantasy across<br />history and of course Piaget did the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.300" end="00:09:07.319" style="s2">same thing from a completely different<br />standpoint so and that a lot of that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.319" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">embedded in this movie so we might as<br />well just walk through it so the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:17.160" style="s2">question might be well why is a lion a<br />king right and because it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.160" end="00:09:20.879" style="s2">people that a lion could be a king and<br />of course a lion is an apex predator and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.879" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">so which means it&#39;s at the top of the<br />food chain roughly speaking and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:28.350" style="s2">sort of golden like the Sun so that&#39;s<br />also useful and you know it has that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.350" end="00:09:32.009" style="s2">Mane that makes it look majestic and of<br />course it&#39;s very physically powerful and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.009" end="00:09:37.649" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s and and and it&#39;s intimidating<br />and so it&#39;s something that you run away</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.649" end="00:09:41.879" style="s2">from as well right or you&#39;re awestruck<br />by so the fact that you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.879" end="00:09:45.839" style="s2">snail king just doesn&#39;t make any sense<br />right but lion king that works and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.839" end="00:09:49.769" style="s2">you got to think about those things<br />because it&#39;s not self-evident why a lion</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.769" end="00:09:54.569" style="s2">would work as a king but uh but a snail<br />wouldn&#39;t but it fits in with the your</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.569" end="00:09:58.649" style="s2">metaphorical understanding of the way<br />the world works much better and so the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.649" end="00:10:03.720" style="s2">Lion King makes sense and well and when<br />things like that that aren&#39;t rationally</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.720" end="00:10:08.370" style="s2">self-evident makes sense you have to ask<br />yourself in what metaphorical context do</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.370" end="00:10:12.959" style="s2">they make sense so you have the Lion<br />King now the movie opens with a sunrise</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.959" end="00:10:16.860" style="s2">and the sunrise is equivalent to the<br />dawn of consciousness so that in many</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.860" end="00:10:23.100" style="s2">archaic stories the Sun was a hero like<br />Horus if I remember correctly was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.100" end="00:10:30.779" style="s2">solar king but but Apollo in particular<br />but Apollo Greek Greek myth the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.779" end="00:10:37.350" style="s2">that at the Sun was this was the the<br />hero the hero who illuminated the sky in</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.350" end="00:10:41.399" style="s2">the day and so heroism and illumination<br />and enlightenment are all tangled</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.399" end="00:10:44.220" style="s2">together metaphorically and then at<br />night what would happen would be that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.220" end="00:10:48.930" style="s2">Sun would fight with the with the dragon<br />of darkness basically or with evil all</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.930" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">night and then rise again victorious in<br />the morning and so it&#39;s a death and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">rebirth theme and it&#39;s very very very<br />very common mythological theme and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.600" style="s2">reason the Sun is associated with<br />consciousness as far as I can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.600" end="00:11:04.380" style="s2">that were not nocturnal creatures right<br />we&#39;re awake during the day and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.380" end="00:11:08.279" style="s2">very very visual half our brain is<br />devoted to visual processing and to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.279" end="00:11:12.779" style="s2">lightened and illuminated means to<br />develop to move towards a higher state</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.779" end="00:11:17.699" style="s2">of consciousness and we naturally use<br />light symbolism to to represent that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.699" end="00:11:21.300" style="s2">know like the light bulb on the top of<br />someone&#39;s head you know you don&#39;t say I</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.300" end="00:11:25.889" style="s2">was in darkened when you learn something<br />new and so again that fits into this</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.889" end="00:11:30.720" style="s2">underlying metaphorical substrate that<br />that&#39;s I think deeply biologically</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:35.430" style="s2">grounded but but also social or socially<br />grounded so it&#39;s a new day it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.430" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">start of a new day and a day day<br />actually means like French your name</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:45.300" style="s2">means day the day trek in some sense and<br />how to comport yourself during the day</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.300" end="00:11:50.249" style="s2">is the fundamental question the day is<br />the canonical unit of time and so you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.249" end="00:11:53.160" style="s2">have to know how to comport yourself<br />during the day and part of that is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.160" end="00:11:56.249" style="s2">journey from consciousness into<br />unconsciousness and that&#39;s and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.249" end="00:12:01.559" style="s2">return so like Apollo you you&#39;ve you<br />descend into unconsciousness and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.559" end="00:12:04.980" style="s2">re-emerge and of course that&#39;s not<br />metaphorical at all that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.980" end="00:12:09.089" style="s2">you do you descend into the underworld<br />of darkness and dreams and strange</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.089" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">things happen down there and so and then<br />you awake if you&#39;re fortunate or</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:17.009" style="s2">unfortunate depending on your state of<br />mind you awake in the morning and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.009" end="00:12:22.139" style="s2">new day right and so the dream world<br />seems to help you sort out your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.139" end="00:12:25.980" style="s2">by the way if you keep people awake for<br />an extended period of time then they</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.980" end="00:12:31.199" style="s2">they they they lose their minds<br />essentially the dream that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.199" end="00:12:34.439" style="s2">unconsciousness and the dream state seem<br />absolutely critical in the maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.439" end="00:12:38.189" style="s2">of mental health although people don&#39;t<br />exactly understand why it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.189" end="00:12:42.300" style="s2">dreams might help you forget because<br />forgetting is really important you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.300" end="00:12:45.689" style="s2">can&#39;t really wait you just can&#39;t<br />remember everything that happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.689" end="00:12:49.740" style="s2">gets today I&#39;m cluttered that that you<br />you&#39;d fall apart and so you reduce</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.740" end="00:12:53.129" style="s2">things to the gist and when you&#39;re doing<br />that you pack them in it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.129" end="00:12:56.519" style="s2">compress them in some sense you pack<br />them into a smaller space and get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.519" end="00:13:00.809" style="s2">everything that isn&#39;t relevant and the<br />dream seems to not be part of that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.809" end="00:13:03.929" style="s2">also seems to be a place where you<br />deeply encode learning that might have</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.929" end="00:13:07.139" style="s2">been done that day which is something<br />that Freud actually noted in his</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.139" end="00:13:10.199" style="s2">interpretation of dreams which is a<br />great book if you&#39;re ever gonna read a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.199" end="00:13:13.829" style="s2">book that Freud wrote the interpretation<br />of Dreams is the proper one to read in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.829" end="00:13:17.579" style="s2">my estimation it&#39;s a brilliant book and<br />it laid the groundwork for a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.579" end="00:13:22.140" style="s2">Jung did and so anyways that&#39;s how the<br />movie starts and the animals come out in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.140" end="00:13:24.840" style="s2">to the light and that&#39;s that&#39;s a<br />metaphor for the dawning of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.840" end="00:13:29.130" style="s2">consciousness to come out into the light<br />where you can see and so this is a baby</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.130" end="00:13:33.750" style="s2">giraffe and babies emerge into the light<br />roughly speaking and that&#39;s that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.750" end="00:13:37.860" style="s2">I said that that&#39;s a representation of<br />the emergence or expansion of</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.860" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">consciousness and so this is how the<br />movie starts it starts a very expansive</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:45.030" style="s2">music as well<br />celebratory music and that&#39;s to indicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.030" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">to you to set the tone for the movie but<br />also to indicate to you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:53.010" style="s2">about to watch something of import and<br />the opening scene is actually a real</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.010" end="00:13:56.250" style="s2">scene of genius in my estimation the<br />animators did a great job and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.250" end="00:14:00.780" style="s2">along very nicely with the music and so<br />you see this little a sand then you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.780" end="00:14:05.130" style="s2">this rock Pride Rock I believe it&#39;s<br />called and in the middle of it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.130" end="00:14:08.910" style="s2">the center it&#39;s the center it&#39;s like the<br />spot that&#39;s marked by a cathedral which</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.910" end="00:14:12.300" style="s2">is an X or a cross and you&#39;re right in<br />the middle of that and so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.300" end="00:14:15.780" style="s2">center of the light that&#39;s another way<br />of thinking about it or it&#39;s the center</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.780" end="00:14:20.040" style="s2">of the territory or it&#39;s the home or<br />it&#39;s the fire in the in the wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.040" end="00:14:24.030" style="s2">or it&#39;s the tree in the center where you<br />live it&#39;s all of those things at once</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.030" end="00:14:29.460" style="s2">it&#39;s inhabited territory with you at the<br />center and the rock represents tradition</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.460" end="00:14:34.980" style="s2">because people tend to inscribe their<br />traditions on rock right or to build</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.980" end="00:14:38.250" style="s2">them into rock like the pyramid so you<br />could think about that as a pyramid as</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.250" end="00:14:41.070" style="s2">an Egyptian pyramid and it&#39;s the right<br />way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.070" end="00:14:44.040" style="s2">you could also think about it as a<br />dominance hierarchy with the apex</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.040" end="00:14:48.150" style="s2">predator at the top and that&#39;s the lion<br />so it makes sense that the lion would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.150" end="00:14:51.480" style="s2">in the light on the rock that&#39;s a<br />pyramid in the middle of the territory</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.480" end="00:14:55.590" style="s2">right that makes sense to people<br />psychologically so because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.590" end="00:15:00.180" style="s2">the state is the state is a hierarchy<br />with with something at the top that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.180" end="00:15:03.780" style="s2">occupies a space that has been<br />illuminated and made safe by</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.780" end="00:15:07.590" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s what the state is<br />and that&#39;s all represented right away in</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.590" end="00:15:12.420" style="s2">this movie and all the animals come to<br />to observe what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.420" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">pyramid and at the top because they need<br />to know what happens at the top</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:20.580" style="s2">partly to organize their world that&#39;s<br />the pyramid but also to see how the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.580" end="00:15:24.690" style="s2">organizational principle works and<br />that&#39;s why they&#39;re all gathering and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.690" end="00:15:28.980" style="s2">they&#39;re gathering in the light in the<br />morning to observe something new that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.980" end="00:15:32.400" style="s2">going to be born that&#39;s of significant<br />importance and that&#39;s the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.400" end="00:15:36.000" style="s2">hero and this little bird here Zazu<br />right</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.000" end="00:15:40.829" style="s2">the zoo is like Horus the Egyptian God<br />who was a Falken and an I at the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.829" end="00:15:46.230" style="s2">time he is the Kings I in this Kings<br />eyes in this movie right he flies up</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.230" end="00:15:50.759" style="s2">above outside of the pyramid so he can<br />see everything that goes on and reports</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.759" end="00:15:54.540" style="s2">to the King and so partly what that<br />indicates is that the thing that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.540" end="00:15:58.470" style="s2">the top of the pyramid needs to be an<br />eye and that&#39;s partly why you see an eye</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.470" end="00:16:01.980" style="s2">on the top of the pyramid on the back of<br />the American dollar bill it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.980" end="00:16:05.339" style="s2">the same idea or if you look at the<br />Washington Monument which is a pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.339" end="00:16:09.720" style="s2">at the top you see that it&#39;s capped with<br />aluminum and you think well why aluminum</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.720" end="00:16:13.470" style="s2">and the answer to that was it was the<br />most expensive metal at that time and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.470" end="00:16:16.379" style="s2">the notion is is that at the top of the<br />pyramid there&#39;s something that actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.379" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong in the pyramid it&#39;s<br />something that goes up above the pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">and can see everything and so you could<br />think about it this way is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.529" style="s2">gonna be in a lot of pyramids in your<br />life dominance hierarchies and different</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.529" end="00:16:32.129" style="s2">states and families and all of that and<br />they&#39;ll arrange themselves into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.129" end="00:16:35.910" style="s2">hierarchy and there&#39;ll be something at<br />the top and the top is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.910" end="00:16:40.920" style="s2">can do well across hierarchies so it&#39;s<br />not stuck in any one pyramid it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.920" end="00:16:45.870" style="s2">partly associated with vision and the<br />ability to see a long long distance also</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.870" end="00:16:50.279" style="s2">to see what you don&#39;t want to see and to<br />report that back to the king and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.279" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">king fundamentally as far as you guys<br />are concerned from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:58.529" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s your super-ego<br />that&#39;s the Freudian perspective or it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.529" end="00:17:02.819" style="s2">might be the moral system by which you<br />comport yourself but your eyes are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.819" end="00:17:06.809" style="s2">thing that updates that right you need<br />it to orient yourself in the world you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.809" end="00:17:11.610" style="s2">need it to orient yourself among other<br />people but your eye and your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.610" end="00:17:15.059" style="s2">pay attention especially to what you<br />don&#39;t want to pay attention to is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.059" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">thing that continually updates that<br />model exactly as Piaget laid out with</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">children so and all of that&#39;s packed<br />into the imagery in the first you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:27.630" style="s2">few minutes of this movie and that&#39;s<br />actually why it relies on imagery why</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.630" end="00:17:30.990" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just a lecture by a<br />psychologist you know when you go to see</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.990" end="00:17:34.890" style="s2">the movie it&#39;s because the images they<br />say a picture is worth a thousand words</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.890" end="00:17:39.510" style="s2">but and there&#39;s thousands of pictures in<br />this movie obviously but maybe a picture</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.510" end="00:17:43.530" style="s2">is worth more words than you can<br />actually use to describe it if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.530" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">pictures is is profound enough and we<br />have many many pictures like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:52.350" style="s2">any deeply symbolic picture<br />is virtually inexhaustible in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.350" end="00:17:57.930" style="s2">its of semantically with regards to its<br />explanation images are very very dense</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.930" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">so anyways the animals all gather now<br />the animals are also in representations</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:06.210" style="s2">from the Freudian perspective and the it<br />is the part of your psyche from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.210" end="00:18:12.060" style="s2">Freudian perspective that&#39;s animalistic<br />and and and full of of implicit drives</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.060" end="00:18:16.410" style="s2">sexual and aggressive in particular as<br />far as Freud was concerned and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.410" end="00:18:20.760" style="s2">because those two drives say unlike<br />thirst or hunger are much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.760" end="00:18:25.620" style="s2">to integrate into proper social being<br />and tend to be excluded and left</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.620" end="00:18:30.270" style="s2">unconscious and so a lot of Freudian<br />psychology and I would say psychology in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.270" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">general is focused on the integration of<br />sexual impulses and aggressive impulses</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:40.140" style="s2">into the psyche I would also add to that<br />anxiety because anxiety is also a major</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.140" end="00:18:44.910" style="s2">problem anxiety and negative emotion<br />that&#39;s pain like is also a major problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.910" end="00:18:49.050" style="s2">for people and so the animals represent<br />those it&#39;d like impulses that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.050" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">organized hierarchically before you can<br />become an integrated being and precisely</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:57.960" style="s2">the piagetian manner right because<br />Piaget would say well the child comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.960" end="00:19:01.730" style="s2">into the world with reflexes and maybe a<br />more modern psychologists would also</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.730" end="00:19:06.630" style="s2">concentrate on the implicit motivations<br />and those have to be organized inside</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.630" end="00:19:11.190" style="s2">the child into some kind of hierarchy of<br />unity before the child can organize him</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.190" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">or herself into the broader unity of the<br />state and that&#39;s basically what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:22.230" style="s2">represented here and so so Zazu the eyes<br />of the king comes to check out the King</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.230" end="00:19:28.230" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh what&#39;s his name what&#39;s the<br />King&#39;s name Mufasa yeah and he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.230" end="00:19:33.150" style="s2">regal looking person lion and he stands<br />up straight and tall and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.150" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">he&#39;s high in serotonin because serotonin<br />governs posterior flexion and if so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:41.040" style="s2">your dominant and near the top of<br />hierarchies you tend to expand so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.040" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2">you look bigger than then you could if<br />you shrunk down and so if you&#39;re low</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.550" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">dominant person you wander around like<br />this so that you look small and weak and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">you don&#39;t pose a threat to anybody but<br />if you&#39;re at the top you expand yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:19:56.430" style="s2">so that you can command the space and<br />that&#39;s why he has that particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.430" end="00:19:59.880" style="s2">of regal posture and if you look at his<br />facial expression you see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.880" end="00:20:03.779" style="s2">quite severe it like he&#39;s he&#39;s capable<br />of kindness but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.779" end="00:20:07.049" style="s2">harsh and judgmental and that&#39;s what<br />society is like that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.049" end="00:20:10.440" style="s2">super-ego is like and what that means is<br />that he&#39;s integrated his aggression and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.440" end="00:20:13.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this happen in my clinical<br />clients when they come in and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.950" end="00:20:17.999" style="s2">too agreeable they look like Simba looks<br />later in the movie when he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.999" end="00:20:21.989" style="s2">adolescent and he&#39;s sort of like a deer<br />in headlights everything is coming in</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.989" end="00:20:26.340" style="s2">and nothing is coming out but when the<br />person integrates their shadow and gets</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.340" end="00:20:29.039" style="s2">the aggressive part of themselves<br />integrated into their personality their</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.039" end="00:20:33.029" style="s2">face is hardened and if you look at<br />people you can tell because the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.029" end="00:20:36.690" style="s2">who are too agreeable look childlike and<br />innocent and the people who well a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.690" end="00:20:42.929" style="s2">aggressive person will look you know<br />mean and cruel but uh let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.929" end="00:20:47.580" style="s2">that&#39;s good that&#39;s still working so but<br />I&#39;ve seen people&#39;s face changes change</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.580" end="00:20:53.489" style="s2">face change in the course of therapy men<br />and women so and what happens is they</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.489" end="00:20:57.299" style="s2">start to look more mature and it&#39;s it&#39;s<br />more like they&#39;re they&#39;re judging the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.299" end="00:21:01.649" style="s2">world as well as interacting with it<br />properly once they integrate that more</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.649" end="00:21:04.879" style="s2">disagreeable part of them it&#39;s very very<br />necessary that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.879" end="00:21:09.179" style="s2">incorporation of the Union shadow or the<br />incorporation of the unconscious from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.179" end="00:21:15.389" style="s2">Freudian perspective but old Musa Musa<br />there he&#39;s already got that he&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.389" end="00:21:20.269" style="s2">got that covered so and he&#39;s capable of<br />obviously he can smile and he&#39;s full</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.269" end="00:21:23.999" style="s2">capable of the full range of expressions<br />but he&#39;s a tough looking character and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.999" end="00:21:29.489" style="s2">and now this baboon here who&#39;s supposed<br />to be basically just a fool when the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.489" end="00:21:33.119" style="s2">story was first written he turned into<br />what&#39;s essentially a shaman across time</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.119" end="00:21:38.219" style="s2">and so he represents the self from the<br />Union perspective now the self is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.219" end="00:21:42.359" style="s2">everything you could be across time so<br />you imagine that there&#39;s you and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.359" end="00:21:46.379" style="s2">the potential inside you whatever that<br />is you know and potential is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.379" end="00:21:50.789" style="s2">interesting idea because it&#39;s represents<br />something that isn&#39;t yet real yet we act</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.789" end="00:21:53.789" style="s2">like it&#39;s real because people will say<br />to you you should live up to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.789" end="00:21:58.589" style="s2">potential and that potential is partly<br />what you could be if you interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.589" end="00:22:03.149" style="s2">the world in a manner that would gain<br />you the most information right because</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.149" end="00:22:06.479" style="s2">you build yourself out of the<br />information in the piagetian sense but</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.479" end="00:22:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s deeper than that - because we know<br />that if you take yourself and you put</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.839" end="00:22:13.679" style="s2">yourself in a new environment new genes<br />turn on in your nervous system they</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.679" end="00:22:17.639" style="s2">encode for new proteins and so you&#39;re<br />full of biological</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.639" end="00:22:21.779" style="s2">tential that won&#39;t be realized unless<br />you move yourself around in the world in</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.779" end="00:22:25.469" style="s2">two different challenging circumstances<br />and that&#39;ll turn on different circuits</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.469" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s not merely that you&#39;re<br />incorporating information from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.549" style="s2">outside world in the constructivist<br />sense it&#39;s that by exposing yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.549" end="00:22:37.139" style="s2">different environments you put different<br />physiological demands on on yourself all</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.139" end="00:22:42.089" style="s2">the way down to the genetic level and<br />that manifests new elements of you and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.089" end="00:22:45.389" style="s2">so one of the things that happens to<br />people and this is a very common</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.389" end="00:22:50.399" style="s2">cultural notion is that you should go on<br />a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.399" end="00:22:54.659" style="s2">central and that would be say like the<br />rock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.659" end="00:22:58.229" style="s2">because you take yourself out of your<br />dopey little village and that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.229" end="00:23:02.009" style="s2">little bounded you that everyone knows<br />and that isn&#39;t very expanded and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.009" end="00:23:05.789" style="s2">you go somewhere dark and dangerous to<br />the central place and while you do that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.789" end="00:23:10.649" style="s2">you have adventures and they tough on<br />you and pull more out of you like partly</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.649" end="00:23:15.749" style="s2">because you&#39;re becoming informed which<br />means in formation it means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.749" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">becoming more organized at every level<br />of analysis but there&#39;s also more of you</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:23.489" style="s2">too and so that&#39;s a very classic idea<br />and then in in cathedrals in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.489" end="00:23:27.899" style="s2">especially at Chartres there&#39;s a big<br />maze on the floor a circular maze which</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.899" end="00:23:31.649" style="s2">is a symbolic representation of the<br />pilgrimage for people who couldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.649" end="00:23:36.119" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a huge circle divided into<br />quadrants which is a union Mandela and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.119" end="00:23:40.349" style="s2">you enter the maze at one point and then<br />you have to walk through the entire maze</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.349" end="00:23:45.299" style="s2">north east west and south before you get<br />to the center and the center is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.299" end="00:23:49.499" style="s2">symbolized by a flower that&#39;s carved in<br />stone it looks like this it&#39;s big this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.499" end="00:23:54.359" style="s2">maze a it&#39;s it&#39;s large so that you can<br />walk it and that&#39;s a symbolic pilgrimage</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.359" end="00:23:57.959" style="s2">it takes you to the center that&#39;s the<br />center of the cross because it&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.959" end="00:24:02.070" style="s2">Cathedral and that&#39;s the point of<br />acceptance of voluntary suffering that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.070" end="00:24:07.289" style="s2">what that means and so you walk through<br />you can call that a circumambulation you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.289" end="00:24:12.989" style="s2">go to all the corners of the world to<br />find yourself and so well the self is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.989" end="00:24:17.759" style="s2">the baboon in this particular in this<br />piece of mandrill actually in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.759" end="00:24:21.389" style="s2">particular representation and he lives<br />in the tree he lives in the tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.389" end="00:24:25.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a bale bob tree in this particular<br />so he&#39;s the spirit that inhabits the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.559" end="00:24:30.299" style="s2">tree of life and he&#39;s the eternal wise<br />man that&#39;s a way of thinking so is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.299" end="00:24:33.390" style="s2">king but<br />he&#39;s sort of a superordinate king or an</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.390" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">outside king in some sense he&#39;s the<br />repository of ancient wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:41.100" style="s2">king is the manner in which that wisdom<br />is currently being acted out in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.100" end="00:24:44.820" style="s2">world and so they&#39;re friends and that<br />means that the king is a good king</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.820" end="00:24:49.230" style="s2">because if they if the king was a bad<br />King he would be alienated from himself</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:53.190" style="s2">and that would make him shallow and<br />one-dimensional and that would make him</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.190" end="00:24:57.810" style="s2">a bad ruler no Union with the traditions<br />of the past to be a good ruler you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.810" end="00:25:02.010" style="s2">to rescue your father from the<br />underworld and integrate that and of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.010" end="00:25:11.640" style="s2">course that&#39;s a main theme in this<br />entire movie so hey a new mystery to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.640" end="00:25:13.880" style="s2">solve</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.610" end="00:25:39.970" style="s2">okay so the hero is born and that&#39;s what<br />the Rising Sun represents and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.970" end="00:25:43.330" style="s2">goes oh oh isn&#39;t that cute and the<br />reason for that is because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.330" end="00:25:47.080" style="s2">biologically wired especially if you&#39;re<br />agreeable to respond with caretaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.080" end="00:25:53.140" style="s2">activity - cute - cuteness and cuteness<br />button nose big eyes small mouths round</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.140" end="00:25:57.550" style="s2">head symmetry and helpless movements and<br />you&#39;ll respond to that across the entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.550" end="00:26:01.990" style="s2">class of mammalian of mammalian<br />creatures even maybe down to lizards you</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.990" end="00:26:07.630" style="s2">know isn&#39;t that cute it&#39;s no it&#39;s a<br />lizard but you know so so so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.630" end="00:26:12.130" style="s2">archetype as well that&#39;s the archetype<br />of the vulnerable hero at Bohr the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.130" end="00:26:18.040" style="s2">vulnerable hero newly born and that<br />should invoke a desire mostly on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.040" end="00:26:22.270" style="s2">part of males to encourage and mostly on<br />the part of females to nur it to nurture</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.270" end="00:26:26.920" style="s2">but males and females are quite cross<br />wired among human beings and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.920" end="00:26:31.060" style="s2">encouragement from the women and there&#39;s<br />also nurturing from the men and of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.060" end="00:26:35.110" style="s2">course those those curves in some sense<br />overlap so there&#39;s more nurturing males</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.110" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">and more encouraging females but that&#39;s<br />roughly the archetype and so he looks</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:42.910" style="s2">cute and everybody goes on and that&#39;s<br />because the animators nailed that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.910" end="00:26:46.510" style="s2">caught the essential features of<br />cuteness and he&#39;s also in the light</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.510" end="00:26:53.680" style="s2">right and so then the shaman mandrel<br />basically baptizes him nots essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.680" end="00:26:57.070" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing and he uses something<br />that symbolic of the Sun which is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.070" end="00:27:00.850" style="s2">ripe fruit and fruits are symbolic of<br />the Sun because of course they need the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.850" end="00:27:04.870" style="s2">Sun to ripen and they&#39;re round like the<br />Sun and so and people know that they</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.870" end="00:27:09.550" style="s2">need light but and and so anyways the<br />animators make a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.550" end="00:27:14.740" style="s2">the fruit that the shaman is going to<br />break and the Sun and so he&#39;s also being</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.740" end="00:27:18.520" style="s2">baptized into the Sun and that means<br />that he&#39;s being baptized into the light</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.520" end="00:27:23.140" style="s2">or that he&#39;s being transformed into a<br />hero and so then everyone&#39;s happy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.140" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">that&#39;s basically you know the divine<br />father and the divine mother and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:30.370" style="s2">divine son and the self who&#39;s taking<br />care of that and there&#39;s a union between</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.370" end="00:27:35.230" style="s2">the baby and the wise old man because<br />the baby is all the potential that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.230" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">realized in the self and there&#39;s an old<br />idea that the way to full maturity is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.860" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">find what you lost as a child and regain<br />it it&#39;s a brilliant idea and that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">that echoes through mists all<br />over the world and that means you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:53.320" style="s2">to regain your capacity once you&#39;re<br />disciplined and you know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.320" end="00:27:56.289" style="s2">something you have to regain your<br />capacity for play and sort of for</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.289" end="00:28:00.879" style="s2">wide-eyed wonder and that&#39;s maybe the<br />childlike part of your spirit and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.879" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">reintegration of that childlike part<br />with the adult grown-up part Reviva Faiz</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.610" end="00:28:10.299" style="s2">the adult grown-up part and allows the<br />child to manifest itself in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.299" end="00:28:13.659" style="s2">disciplined way in the world and so<br />that&#39;s all being hinted that there and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.659" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">then they showed the shaman shows the<br />baby the newborn hero to the crowd and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:24.519" style="s2">it&#39;s very cool what happens in the movie<br />all the animals spontaneously Neil and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.519" end="00:28:27.759" style="s2">can give you an example of that kind of<br />spontaneous action in a crowd</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.759" end="00:28:33.669" style="s2">it&#39;s imagine you&#39;re watching off<br />gymnastics performance right and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.669" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like at a high level world-class<br />performance and someone comes out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:41.500" style="s2">and they do this routine that&#39;s just<br />dead letter-perfect you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.500" end="00:28:45.129" style="s2">stop and everybody claps like mad right<br />and it&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.129" end="00:28:48.129" style="s2">and so then the next contestant comes<br />out and they&#39;re basically in real</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.129" end="00:28:51.639" style="s2">trouble because you know this person<br />just got nine point seven out of ten and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.639" end="00:28:55.659" style="s2">it was perfect so how do you beat<br />perfect and so will they come out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.659" end="00:28:58.330" style="s2">and then you watch them and you&#39;re right<br />on the edge of your seat because what</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.330" end="00:29:02.379" style="s2">you see them do is something<br />extraordinarily disciplined just like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.379" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">the last person did but they push<br />themselves into that zone that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:10.120" style="s2">beyond their discipline capacity and you<br />can tell every second you&#39;re watching it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.120" end="00:29:14.049" style="s2">that they&#39;re that close to disaster and<br />so you&#39;re right on the edge of your seat</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.049" end="00:29:18.250" style="s2">and and you know that they&#39;re doing a<br />high-wire act without a net and so when</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.250" end="00:29:22.299" style="s2">they finally land triumphantly you&#39;ll<br />all stand up and clap spontaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.299" end="00:29:26.100" style="s2">it&#39;s because you&#39;ve just witnessed<br />someone who&#39;s a master at playing a game</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.100" end="00:29:30.370" style="s2">who&#39;s also a master at improving how to<br />play that game at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.370" end="00:29:33.789" style="s2">people love that more than anything to<br />see that it&#39;s just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.789" end="00:29:37.559" style="s2">overwhelming because it&#39;s a testament to<br />the human spirit and you&#39;ll respond</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.559" end="00:29:42.279" style="s2">automatically and unconsciously to that<br />and that&#39;s why that&#39;s an analogy to why</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.279" end="00:29:48.429" style="s2">the animals all spontaneously bow when<br />now what happens is they shows the Lion</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.429" end="00:29:53.440" style="s2">King and the Sun breaks and shines on<br />that the hero at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.440" end="00:29:56.919" style="s2">there&#39;s this concordance between an<br />earthly event and a so-called heavenly</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.919" end="00:30:00.429" style="s2">event and you would call that<br />synchronous that&#39;s his idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.429" end="00:30:04.570" style="s2">synchronicity where<br />something important subjectively is also</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.570" end="00:30:08.590" style="s2">signified by something that appears in<br />narrative keeping with that in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.590" end="00:30:12.280" style="s2">outside world that&#39;s one of the most<br />controversial elements of his theory but</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.280" end="00:30:16.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve experienced a variety of<br />synchronous events and they often happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.060" end="00:30:20.500" style="s2">in therapy especially around dreams but<br />they&#39;re very hard to communicate because</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.500" end="00:30:24.820" style="s2">they&#39;re so specific to the context in<br />which it occurs they&#39;re very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.820" end="00:30:29.470" style="s2">to explain so anyways it&#39;s the<br />synchronous event that make drops all</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.470" end="00:30:33.910" style="s2">the animals to their knees so there&#39;s<br />the Sun coming out and there&#39;s shining</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.910" end="00:30:37.540" style="s2">on them and all the primates go mad for<br />that and that&#39;s of course exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.540" end="00:30:44.350" style="s2">we do when we applaud and then we switch<br />to scar now scar is mufasa&#39;s brother</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.350" end="00:30:48.820" style="s2">evil brother the king always has an evil<br />brother and so does the hero the hero</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.820" end="00:30:52.720" style="s2">always has an adversary and the reason<br />for that is the king always has an evil</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.720" end="00:30:57.610" style="s2">brother and that means that the state<br />always has a tyrannical element and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.610" end="00:31:02.890" style="s2">tyrannical element exists for two<br />reasons one is the state deteriorate of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.890" end="00:31:07.900" style="s2">its own accord and that&#39;s an entropy<br />observation what that means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.900" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">state is a construction of the past<br />right but the present isn&#39;t the same as</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:17.260" style="s2">the past and to the degree that the past<br />is mismatched with the demands of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.260" end="00:31:22.420" style="s2">present then it&#39;s then it&#39;s then it&#39;s a<br />tyrannical it&#39;s malfunctioning and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.420" end="00:31:27.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a continual problem with the<br />state it&#39;s always two steps behind the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.250" end="00:31:31.810" style="s2">environment and so then that means that<br />the awareness of living people has to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.810" end="00:31:36.070" style="s2">update the state and so Eliot and Maria<br />Eliot who&#39;s a great historian of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.070" end="00:31:39.550" style="s2">religions looked at flood stories from<br />all over the world because there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.550" end="00:31:42.700" style="s2">flood stories from all over the world<br />partly because there are floods all over</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.700" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">the world but that&#39;s there&#39;s a<br />psychological reason to so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:50.860" style="s2">New Orleans was wiped out by a hurricane<br />right a flood didn&#39;t you say well that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.860" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">was an act of God but then you think<br />wait a second wait a second they knew</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:31:58.660" style="s2">those dam dykes weren&#39;t gonna hold they<br />knew they weren&#39;t built strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.660" end="00:32:02.650" style="s2">they took the money that was allocated<br />to the dikes and spent it badly and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.650" end="00:32:07.030" style="s2">was willful blindness and so you could<br />say that it was God who caused the flood</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.030" end="00:32:11.050" style="s2">so to speak metaphorically but you could<br />also say that it was the degeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.050" end="00:32:15.760" style="s2">the state and the willful blindness of<br />the politicians that call</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.760" end="00:32:19.690" style="s2">the flood in Holland they build the<br />dikes to withstand the worst storm in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.690" end="00:32:24.460" style="s2">10,000 years in the you southern US they<br />built them to withstand the worst storm</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.460" end="00:32:29.020" style="s2">in a hundred years and they knew that<br />that was insufficient and so the flood</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.020" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">if there&#39;s a flood well you can say well<br />that&#39;s an act of nature but you can also</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:36.760" style="s2">say just wait a sec maybe if there was a<br />flood because we looked the other way</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.760" end="00:32:41.230" style="s2">and because our systems were out of date<br />and that&#39;s why in flood stories there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.230" end="00:32:45.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a continual theme which is the<br />the people get wiped out by the flood</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.970" end="00:32:52.210" style="s2">because God judges them harshly for<br />their senility and their willful</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.210" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">blindness and it&#39;s a story that&#39;s very<br />much you&#39;ll have a flood in your life</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.240" style="s2">right it&#39;ll be a flood of chaos and<br />you&#39;ll find of one form another and</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.240" end="00:33:05.350" style="s2">you&#39;ll find when you investigate the<br />causes of the flood that some of it will</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:08.380" style="s2">be and sometimes this is cake the case<br />it&#39;s just random</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.380" end="00:33:12.130" style="s2">you just got singled out you got a<br />terrible disease and that&#39;s the end of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.130" end="00:33:15.190" style="s2">you or something like that but there&#39;ll<br />be other situations where the flood</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.190" end="00:33:18.940" style="s2">comes and you&#39;re surrounded by chaos and<br />you&#39;ll look into it you&#39;ll think I knew</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.940" end="00:33:23.620" style="s2">this was coming I knew I wasn&#39;t paying<br />attention I knew I hadn&#39;t sorted things</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.620" end="00:33:28.540" style="s2">out and the consequences of that will<br />have cascaded and wiped you out and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.540" end="00:33:31.690" style="s2">you&#39;re in real trouble because not only<br />did you get wiped out but you also know</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.690" end="00:33:35.620" style="s2">it&#39;s your fault and that is not a good<br />thing that makes you bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.620" end="00:33:40.750" style="s2">resentful and murderous when that<br />happens so anyways scar is scarred right</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.750" end="00:33:44.170" style="s2">so what that implies is he&#39;s had a<br />pretty rough life and he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.170" end="00:33:47.980" style="s2">skinny and he said he was born in the<br />low end of the gene pool and so he has</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.980" end="00:33:51.220" style="s2">reasons to be resentful<br />he&#39;s also hyper intelligent and rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.220" end="00:33:56.770" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the things you see very<br />commonly about the evil adversary of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.770" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">state or of the individuals often<br />intelligent and hyper rational and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.620" style="s2">best commentator on that was probably<br />John Milton and Paradise Lost because</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.620" end="00:34:10.120" style="s2">that&#39;s how he represents Lucifer or<br />Satan who&#39;s the spirit of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.120" end="00:34:14.679" style="s2">and enlightenment strangely enough hence<br />Lucifer the bringer of light and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.679" end="00:34:17.740" style="s2">reason for that as far as I can tell and<br />this is something that Milton figured</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.740" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">out when he compiled all these ancient<br />stories about evil and tried to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">them coherent was that the problem with<br />irrationality with rationality is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.740" style="s2">it tends to fall in love with its own<br />product</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.740" end="00:34:33.399" style="s2">right and so then it comes up with a<br />theory that makes that a totality and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.399" end="00:34:37.929" style="s2">then it won&#39;t let go so the rational<br />mind has a totalitarian element and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.929" end="00:34:41.619" style="s2">know that to some degree because that<br />kind of rationality seems more left</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.619" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">hemisphere focused and the left<br />hemisphere tends to impose structured</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.929" style="s2">order on the world and be updated by the<br />right hemisphere and the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.929" end="00:34:53.409" style="s2">hemisphere generally updates it with<br />negative information and with fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.409" end="00:34:57.580" style="s2">and so the left hemisphere will impose a<br />coherent structure on the world which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.580" end="00:35:01.570" style="s2">really necessary for you live in it but<br />the problem is there&#39;s a tension between</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.570" end="00:35:05.950" style="s2">coherence and completeness and that&#39;s<br />partly why you need two hemispheres you</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.950" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">need one to represent the world and you<br />need one to keep track of the exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.760" end="00:35:14.740" style="s2">and to feed those slowly into the<br />representational system so that it so</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.740" end="00:35:17.710" style="s2">that it can stay updated without<br />collapsing into complete chaos</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.710" end="00:35:24.430" style="s2">so anyways scar and he&#39;s got this like<br />droopy mouth and this whiny arrogant</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.430" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">voice and he feels hard done by and he&#39;s<br />resentful and and in in classic heroes</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.470" end="00:35:35.080" style="s2">stories stories of the state as well the<br />so this is an Egyptian take on it Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.080" end="00:35:40.000" style="s2">was was the god of the state and set who<br />later became Satan that name became</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.000" end="00:35:45.490" style="s2">Satan as it transformed through Coptic<br />Christianity Osiris had a brother named</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.490" end="00:35:51.040" style="s2">set and set he didn&#39;t pay attention to<br />set enough attention and set was always</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.040" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">scheme scheming to overthrow the kingdom<br />just like scar is and the Egyptian said</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:01.030" style="s2">straightforwardly that the reason that<br />Osiris got overthrown by said he got</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.030" end="00:36:04.330" style="s2">chopped into pieces and his pieces<br />distributed throughout the state in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.330" end="00:36:08.530" style="s2">mythological representation and those<br />pieces were actually the provinces of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.530" end="00:36:12.430" style="s2">Egypt technically speaking so and that&#39;s<br />what the Egyptians thought so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.430" end="00:36:16.810" style="s2">quite cool but the Egyptians said<br />explicitly that the reason that Osiris</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.810" end="00:36:21.850" style="s2">got overthrown by set was because he was<br />willfully blind old senile and willfully</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.850" end="00:36:26.619" style="s2">blind same idea as the flood myth you<br />don&#39;t see that quite here because Mufasa</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.619" end="00:36:31.780" style="s2">is sort of on to set or to scar but scar<br />is more treacherous than Mufasa believes</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.780" end="00:36:37.900" style="s2">and he gets at he gets at Mufasa by<br />going through his son by by by playing</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.900" end="00:36:42.820" style="s2">on on the impulsivity and and juvenile<br />qualities of his son</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.820" end="00:36:46.750" style="s2">so obviously there&#39;s some antagonism<br />between these two as you can see by</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.750" end="00:36:51.460" style="s2">their facial expressions there and there<br />is a good example of scar you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.460" end="00:36:55.840" style="s2">got that droopy kind of whiny malevolent<br />face and that malevolent voice that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.840" end="00:37:01.360" style="s2">Jeremy Irons pulls off so incredibly<br />well and he&#39;s always skulking he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.360" end="00:37:05.230" style="s2">creature of the night he always skulks<br />around he&#39;s not a creature of the day in</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.230" end="00:37:10.390" style="s2">any sense of the word and you know<br />obviously Mufasa is golden like the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.390" end="00:37:15.120" style="s2">and scars dark like the night that&#39;s<br />another thing another clue another hint</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.120" end="00:37:19.300" style="s2">okay there&#39;s the tree that&#39;s The Tree of<br />Life we already talked about that I</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.300" end="00:37:23.080" style="s2">think that represents the multiple<br />levels at which you exist simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.080" end="00:37:27.670" style="s2">all the way from the subatomic all the<br />way up to the cosmic so to speak and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.670" end="00:37:31.240" style="s2">that&#39;s a different kind of dimension and<br />that&#39;s the that&#39;s the place that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.240" end="00:37:35.850" style="s2">self inhabits and it can kind of move up<br />and down those dimensions but anyways</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.850" end="00:37:42.220" style="s2">that the shaman lives inside that tree<br />and and that&#39;s our first introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.220" end="00:37:45.640" style="s2">him basically but he&#39;s the spirit of the<br />ancient tree that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.640" end="00:37:49.630" style="s2">thinking about a very very common<br />element in stories right the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.630" end="00:37:56.350" style="s2">the ancient tree and so all right so now<br />Mufasa has taken taken Simba up to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.350" end="00:38:00.250" style="s2">top of the pyramid right so that&#39;s the<br />the aluminum place let&#39;s say or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.250" end="00:38:04.510" style="s2">place of the eye where you can really<br />see a long ways and he&#39;s explaining to</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.510" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">him what his kingdom is going to be and<br />you see the Sun of course appears that</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.620" end="00:38:12.070" style="s2">that to begin with and that&#39;s another<br />hint about being at the top that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.070" end="00:38:16.600" style="s2">illuminated part of the pyramid and so<br />they&#39;re up there talking and what Mufasa</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.600" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">tells Simba is that his kingdom is<br />everyplace the light has touched and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">that&#39;s so brilliant so one of the things<br />you&#39;ll notice if you move into a new</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:29.530" style="s2">apartment you&#39;re like a cat cats don&#39;t<br />like changing houses and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.530" end="00:38:32.890" style="s2">zoom around in every corner to see<br />exactly what the hell&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.890" end="00:38:36.610" style="s2">before they calm down they need to know<br />where they can hide and where the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.610" end="00:38:40.390" style="s2">potential dangers are and what you&#39;ll<br />find if you move into a new place that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.390" end="00:38:44.560" style="s2">you will not be comfortable there until<br />you&#39;ve investigated potentially cleaned</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:50.200" style="s2">and repaired every single square inch of<br />it the more attention you pay to it the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.200" end="00:38:54.730" style="s2">more it&#39;ll become yours and that&#39;s far<br />more than mere like material ownership</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.730" end="00:38:57.880" style="s2">which is also relevant<br />but in order to feel comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.880" end="00:39:03.310" style="s2">somewhere and to dominate that place to<br />be in meshed in that place you have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.310" end="00:39:07.540" style="s2">attend to it you have to shine light on<br />every corner and you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:10.810" style="s2">with yourself and with your<br />relationships as well and so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.810" end="00:39:15.580" style="s2">Mufasa tells Simba that his kingdom is<br />everything that the light shines on and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.580" end="00:39:19.510" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right and then there&#39;s a<br />metaphor there too which is that what</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.510" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve Shawn light on which is what<br />you&#39;ve come to understand and master is</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:27.250" style="s2">surrounded by an Otherworld of all the<br />things that you don&#39;t understand and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.250" end="00:39:30.609" style="s2">some of those would be natural things<br />and some of them would be tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.609" end="00:39:33.550" style="s2">things and some of those would be things<br />you don&#39;t want to know about yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.550" end="00:39:37.570" style="s2">but they&#39;re outside of where you&#39;ve<br />managed to shine the light and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.570" end="00:39:41.890" style="s2">exactly what Mufasa tells Simba says we<br />live in this pyramid we&#39;re at the top</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.890" end="00:39:46.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a domain of light around it<br />that&#39;s explored territory outside of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.540" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">that there&#39;s explore unexplored<br />territory and that&#39;s partly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:53.770" style="s2">unconscious because you fill it with<br />fantasy and it&#39;s partly what you just</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.770" end="00:39:59.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know and then Mufasa tells Simba<br />and it&#39;s sort of like God telling Adam</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.080" end="00:40:03.580" style="s2">and even in the Garden of Eden not to<br />eat the apple Mufasa tells Simba there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.580" end="00:40:07.810" style="s2">that this outside place that&#39;s dark<br />that&#39;s not part of your kingdom and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.810" end="00:40:11.560" style="s2">should not go there and that&#39;s really<br />interesting because Simba doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.560" end="00:40:16.210" style="s2">know about that place yet and so Mufasa<br />is doing something very contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.210" end="00:40:21.010" style="s2">there it&#39;s like telling him that it<br />exists and and heightening his curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.010" end="00:40:25.270" style="s2">but also saying that he should go there<br />almost ensuring that that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.270" end="00:40:30.490" style="s2">Simba is going to do you see this in the<br />Pinocchio movie to where Pinocchio is</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.490" end="00:40:35.500" style="s2">planning to jump into the ocean to go<br />get Geppetto from the underworld and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.500" end="00:40:38.920" style="s2">he&#39;s following his conscience is along<br />with him Jiminy Cricket</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.920" end="00:40:42.609" style="s2">and the cricket is warning him about all<br />the dangers that he&#39;ll face down there</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.609" end="00:40:46.359" style="s2">and telling him that he will be fish<br />food personally and while he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.359" end="00:40:49.300" style="s2">that<br />Pinocchio ties a knot around his donkey</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.300" end="00:40:53.170" style="s2">tail around a rock so he can sink and<br />and the little cricket helps him tie the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.170" end="00:40:57.070" style="s2">knot so well he&#39;s warning him about the<br />adventure he&#39;s going to undertake at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.070" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">same time he&#39;s encouraging him to do it<br />and there&#39;s that paradoxical thing which</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.410" style="s2">is that if you go outside what you know<br />it will cause a fall because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.410" end="00:41:08.859" style="s2">damage your knowledge structures and<br />you&#39;ll go down into chaos and that can</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.859" end="00:41:12.940" style="s2">really destroy you so you should<br />do it but by the same token if you do do</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.940" end="00:41:17.410" style="s2">it and you do it successfully then the<br />new you that are&#39; arises can be stronger</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.410" end="00:41:21.580" style="s2">and more complete than the previous you<br />so you should do it and you shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.580" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">it and that&#39;s anyone sensible says look<br />don&#39;t bother right but sensible isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">enough that&#39;s the thing you have to also<br />be not sensible enough in order to live</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:35.050" style="s2">and your typical hero and Harry Potter<br />is a really good example is always a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.050" end="00:41:40.180" style="s2">rule breaker always but he you know the<br />rules he breaks are like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.180" end="00:41:45.880" style="s2">judicious nough speaking the hero breaks<br />a rule in the service of a higher good</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.880" end="00:41:48.520" style="s2">but he&#39;s still breaking the rules and<br />that&#39;s what puts them outside the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.520" end="00:41:55.660" style="s2">boundary of the social of the social<br />establishment so now at this point Simba</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.660" end="00:42:00.790" style="s2">also gets introduced to scar and that<br />that that has two meanings one is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.790" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">scar is the tyrannical element of the<br />state and so as a child when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:09.070" style="s2">being socialized you encounter the<br />tyranny of the state and one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.070" end="00:42:13.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t yet there&#39;s no way around it<br />one of the best examples of that is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.120" end="00:42:16.180" style="s2">children are always running around<br />having fun and they&#39;re really bubbly and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.180" end="00:42:21.370" style="s2">and impulsive and joyous and playful and<br />that causes a lot of trouble because</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.370" end="00:42:24.610" style="s2">positive emotion is very disruptive<br />they&#39;ll run around and break things</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.610" end="00:42:28.030" style="s2">they&#39;ll hurt themselves and they&#39;ll get<br />into trouble and so you&#39;re always saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.030" end="00:42:32.710" style="s2">calm down sit down behave don&#39;t do that<br />and it&#39;s it&#39;s not because they&#39;re crying</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.710" end="00:42:36.520" style="s2">or angry it&#39;s because there&#39;s a day I&#39;m<br />happy and impulsive that no one can</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.520" end="00:42:40.990" style="s2">stand them and so and so that&#39;s a<br />tyranny it&#39;s like that the state puts</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.990" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">puts pressure on you to regulate your<br />emotions positive negative and positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:49.960" style="s2">and it crushes you it crushes the life<br />out of you a lot of it and so you end up</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.960" end="00:42:53.560" style="s2">you know your age and you&#39;re all mopey<br />because the holes especially because</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.560" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve been forced to sit down in school<br />for like 17 years you&#39;re all mopey and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.540" style="s2">it&#39;s no wonder you know you&#39;ve had the<br />spirit taken out of you by the process</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.540" end="00:43:05.230" style="s2">of discipline but without that you&#39;d be<br />completely useless so it&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.230" end="00:43:11.050" style="s2">of those paradoxical you know gifts and<br />and catastrophes that you encounter as</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.050" end="00:43:15.640" style="s2">you move through life so anyways Simba<br />look at how happy he is you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.640" end="00:43:19.660" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t know a damn thing he&#39;s so<br />naive you can tell but oh look it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.660" end="00:43:24.040" style="s2">uncle Scar it&#39;s like you know and this<br />is not a guy you smile at</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.040" end="00:43:29.230" style="s2">clearly but he&#39;s all positive emotion<br />and joy and enthusiasm and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.230" end="00:43:32.740" style="s2">good because that means this character<br />can take serious advantage of it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.740" end="00:43:37.030" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what he does and so scar<br />pretends to be on his side which is what</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.030" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">a good pedophile always does by the way<br />and so you know you you take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:45.580" style="s2">of the child&#39;s trusting nature and<br />openness in order to exploit them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.580" end="00:43:49.240" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what horrible people do<br />that all the time including the parents</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.240" end="00:43:53.260" style="s2">of children and other children<br />themselves so you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.260" end="00:43:57.100" style="s2">false I mean look at the animators are<br />so damn brilliant Hey look at that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.100" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">expression really like you know you just<br />look at that and you think well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.510" style="s2">just a facial expression but of course<br />it&#39;s not some damn animators worked</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.510" end="00:44:08.860" style="s2">really hard to get that they&#39;re really<br />observant and they distill the facial</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.860" end="00:44:13.540" style="s2">looks like the face is right it covers<br />the whole head and and they&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.540" end="00:44:17.260" style="s2">eyebrow lifts proper and they&#39;ve got<br />this horrible sanctimonious smile and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.260" end="00:44:21.070" style="s2">the tilt of the head then you know and<br />he&#39;s sort of crushing him while he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.070" end="00:44:25.090" style="s2">hugging him at the same time and really<br />really and you know it took a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.090" end="00:44:28.600" style="s2">thought for every single one of these<br />frames to be put together right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.600" end="00:44:32.500" style="s2">a tremendous amount of cognitive effort<br />that went into that so none of this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.500" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">accidental<br />yeah well that pretty much says</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:38.710" style="s2">everything it&#39;s like whoo I hate that<br />kid and to hardly wait till he&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.710" end="00:44:43.120" style="s2">and didn&#39;t I pull one over on him you<br />know it&#39;s a real testament to an adult&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.120" end="00:44:48.430" style="s2">genius when he can fool a kid so then<br />Simba encounters the anima that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.500" end="00:44:53.660" style="s2">anima the Jungian anima and the anima is<br />the feminine counterpart in the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.660" end="00:44:59.110" style="s2">she well yeah you could tell what she<br />does to him right because she&#39;s got this</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.110" end="00:45:03.880" style="s2">supercilious and and what would you say<br />judgmental and teasing look on her face</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.880" end="00:45:07.510" style="s2">and she&#39;s really trying to put him down<br />and it&#39;s work it like bad he&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.510" end="00:45:11.500" style="s2">happy about that at all and she&#39;s the<br />thing this is what the anima does the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.500" end="00:45:17.590" style="s2">soul she&#39;s the thing that teaches the<br />exploratory hero that that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.590" end="00:45:21.670" style="s2">everything it could be right and that&#39;s<br />part of this can be read multiple ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.670" end="00:45:26.650" style="s2">but it&#39;s part of the eternal tendency of<br />women to makes men self-conscious by</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.650" end="00:45:30.460" style="s2">their sexual selectivity that&#39;s part of<br />it because that makes men self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.460" end="00:45:34.810" style="s2">like nothing else and it&#39;s also perhaps<br />been one of the phenomena that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.810" end="00:45:37.900" style="s2">produced the evolutionary arms race in<br />this in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.900" end="00:45:42.210" style="s2">sex is among human beings that&#39;s caused<br />our rapid cortical expansion and our</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.210" end="00:45:47.350" style="s2">quick movement away from chimpanzees who<br />aren&#39;t selective mater&#39;s by the way so</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.350" end="00:45:52.660" style="s2">look at him Jesus you just want to slap<br />him right he&#39;s a he&#39;s the son of a king</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.660" end="00:45:56.440" style="s2">so he&#39;s very very privileged and he<br />confuses his privilege with competence</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.440" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">rich of course all of you do because<br />you&#39;re all sons of the King which is why</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">you can sit here in the university and<br />you confuse your privilege with</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.680" style="s2">competence as well because it&#39;s not has<br />nothing to do with any of you that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.680" end="00:46:10.750" style="s2">lights are on and that&#39;s the place is so<br />peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.750" end="00:46:14.320" style="s2">right but you take that for granted and<br />it can make you false and arrogant like</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.320" end="00:46:19.300" style="s2">like Jesus that&#39;s just so sad you look<br />at that kid you think he&#39;s he&#39;s in for</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.300" end="00:46:23.230" style="s2">real trouble man he thinks he knows<br />everything and of course then he has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.230" end="00:46:28.930" style="s2">wrestling match with what&#39;s-her-name<br />what&#39;s it was it Nala yeah he has a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.930" end="00:46:32.770" style="s2">wrestling match with Nala and she just<br />pins him every time right gotcha again</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.770" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">pindy again and that&#39;s basically right<br />one of the things that happens with men</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">when they meet a woman who they really<br />desire that Myers they project an idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:44.680" style="s2">onto her immediately that&#39;s an anima<br />projection and then that Adam a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.680" end="00:46:48.250" style="s2">projection judges them and they act all<br />inferior and stupid and it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.250" end="00:46:53.350" style="s2">because they are that&#39;s why and so then<br />they they go down in defeat constantly</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.350" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">to this thing that they&#39;re projecting<br />which at least has some concordance with</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:01.030" style="s2">the actual woman but not that much so<br />okay they keep wrestling and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.030" end="00:47:04.750" style="s2">they&#39;re on the fringe of the kingdom<br />this wrestling match between this pairs</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.750" end="00:47:08.530" style="s2">of opposites takes them to the edge of<br />the kingdom and they end up in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.530" end="00:47:13.000" style="s2">elephant&#39;s graveyard right and and<br />there&#39;s there&#39;s bones everywhere and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.000" end="00:47:16.360" style="s2">now they&#39;re out into the kingdom of<br />death and what that means is that these</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.360" end="00:47:21.460" style="s2">two kids as they&#39;ve grown up encounter<br />death right they go outside the light</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.460" end="00:47:26.560" style="s2">it&#39;s very very shocking for them they&#39;re<br />very curious about it obviously they go</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.560" end="00:47:30.100" style="s2">to explore the skeletons and all of that<br />even though they were told not to but</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.100" end="00:47:34.630" style="s2">their curiosity they can&#39;t stay away<br />from death they&#39;re too curious about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.630" end="00:47:38.920" style="s2">and so they developed knowledge of death<br />and that and then of course out there in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.920" end="00:47:42.460" style="s2">the Deadlands is where the hyenas are<br />and that&#39;s exactly right because hyenas</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.460" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">are scavengers right and they can break<br />bones with their teeth they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.530" style="s2">really quite the animal and you know you<br />kind of have a shudder of repugnance</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.530" end="00:47:54.040" style="s2">when you see those things<br />and I think it&#39;s partly I mean we shared</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.040" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">an evolutionary landscape with the<br />ancestors of hyenas for a very very long</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:02.140" style="s2">time and like vultures too you know you<br />couldn&#39;t imagine something that would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.140" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">more well designed to look like it was a<br />horrible thing than a vulture right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:11.530" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird concordance and crows<br />and ravens are like that - carrion</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.530" end="00:48:15.160" style="s2">eaters you know the Eagles are kind of<br />an exception but they look just as</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.160" end="00:48:19.390" style="s2">creepy as they are which is really quite<br />interesting and of course hyenas fall</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.390" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">into that category and they laugh -<br />which is you know really you you also</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:27.490" style="s2">have to laugh really with all these<br />other things you have going for you and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.490" end="00:48:31.720" style="s2">anyways the hyenas and hyenas are<br />enemies of lions and they can take lions</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.720" end="00:48:35.830" style="s2">down they&#39;re tough things and you know<br />they&#39;re not one high in obviously but a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.830" end="00:48:38.590" style="s2">bunch of hyenas can give a lie in a<br />pretty damn rough time</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.590" end="00:48:43.900" style="s2">and so and these little lines are really<br />no match for the hyenas so they get</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.900" end="00:48:48.100" style="s2">threatened very very rapidly and one of<br />the hyenas of course is just completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.100" end="00:48:52.030" style="s2">out of its mind and one of the things<br />that&#39;s really interesting and you see</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.030" end="00:48:55.570" style="s2">this with the Muppets - there was often<br />a puppet that was like a crazy puppet</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.570" end="00:48:58.420" style="s2">and its eyes would move in different<br />directions you know and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.420" end="00:49:01.690" style="s2">things that happens with people who are<br />schizophrenic is they show involuntary</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.690" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">eye movements and it&#39;s because you have<br />a brain center that controls your eyes</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:09.100" style="s2">voluntarily and you have another one<br />that controls them involuntarily so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.100" end="00:49:13.660" style="s2">can see that look ahead and try to move<br />your eyes smoothly back and forth you</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.660" end="00:49:17.500" style="s2">can&#39;t do it you&#39;ll see that they jerk<br />hey but if you watch put a finger in</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.500" end="00:49:21.280" style="s2">front of your face and then do this<br />they&#39;ll move perfectly smoothly and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.280" end="00:49:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s because you&#39;re using different<br />eye control centers one voluntary and</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.120" end="00:49:29.140" style="s2">one more involuntary and the involuntary<br />one is actually more sophisticated and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.140" end="00:49:34.390" style="s2">so in schizophrenic the involuntary eye<br />control centers tend to disrupt the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.390" end="00:49:39.550" style="s2">voluntary eye control centers and that&#39;s<br />likely part of the hallucinatory process</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.550" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">you know because you have the ego in<br />this schizophrenic that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:46.540" style="s2">disrupted by processes underneath<br />fantasies and that sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.540" end="00:49:49.630" style="s2">that looks like it&#39;s reflected in<br />involuntary eye movements like like</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.630" end="00:49:54.310" style="s2">dream movements so anyways so much for<br />the crazy hyena and they&#39;re in real</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.310" end="00:49:57.670" style="s2">trouble now the Kings I who&#39;s supposed<br />to be keeping an eye on this and was</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.670" end="00:50:01.630" style="s2">supposed to be watching Simba is trying<br />to intervene but I mean look at him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.630" end="00:50:05.490" style="s2">a like a delicious little bird and so<br />that&#39;s not working out very well</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.490" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">anyways and then you see this immediate<br />juxtaposition of the domain of death and</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:15.820" style="s2">the hyenas with hell right and everyone<br />looks at that and they think well they</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.820" end="00:50:19.390" style="s2">know exactly what that means it&#39;s no<br />surprise to anyone that that happens and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.390" end="00:50:24.340" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s partly because on the<br />veldt where we evolved in large part but</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.340" end="00:50:28.540" style="s2">not by no means all part fire was an<br />ever-present danger in the grasslands</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.540" end="00:50:37.770" style="s2">right and so and so that&#39;s a good that&#39;s<br />a good example of Hell so huh well I</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.770" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">guess that&#39;s it we&#39;ll do some more of<br />this when we meet on Tuesday bye</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.180" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">you</p>
