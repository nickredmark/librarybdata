so I think the best way to continue towalk you through the thinkers that we're
planning to cover is to do that withexamples they stick better and they're
more interesting and it's very difficultto understand you outside of a narrative
context and so I'm going to walk youthrough the Lion King today how many of
you have seen the Lion King yesso how many of you haven't right okay so
so you obviously were raised in a boxsomewhere out in the middle of field so
anyways you know it's it's it's anamazingly popular animated movie I think
it was the most highest grossinganimated movie ever made made until
frozen which I actually absolutelydetested but the Lion King The Lion King
is actually consciously influenced byarchetypes as well as unconsciously
influenced by them so it's a bit of acheat I would say in some sense but it
doesn't I don't for the purposes thatwe're using it for I think it's just
fine and so partly what you might thinkabout is that it's its relationship to
archetypal themes that made it sooverwhelmingly popular it's same being
the case with say books and movies likeHarry Potter or the entire Marvel series
the Marvel series is quite interesting Iknow somebody who wrote for Batman and
for Wolverine I know Batman he's intoMarvel comic but one of the things that
he told me that was quite interestingwas that once these characters take off
and establish a life of their own theyhave a backstory and which becomes part
of the mythology that's collectivelyheld by the readers and if you you can
invent an alternative universe where youcan muck about with the backstory but
otherwise you better stick with it orthe readers are gonna write you and tell
you that you've got the story wrong andso there's a bit of a collaboration
between the writers and the readersafter these things take on a life of
their own and so and of course the theythey tend to the the comic books in
particular tend to tend towardsmythological themes very very rapidly
and so anyways Carl Jung was afascinating person I think
you can read his biography autobiography/ biography which is called memories
dreams and reflections which in manyways I think is an unfortunate book
because it's usually the only book thatpeople read that's that is more or less
by young but and it is more popular yetpopularly accessible which is probably a
good thing but it's also it's not asrigorous as his other books and so the
problem with someone like Jung is youkind of have to read him as much as you
can in the original because interpretinghim is not a very straightforward matter
he was a very visionary person by whichI mean he had an incredible visual
imagination and he used that a lot heused it in his therapy practice I
believe that most of his therapy clientswere high in trade openness I have a lot
of clients who are high in tradeopenness they kind of seek me out
because I'm high and trade openness andyou know they watch my videos and that
sort of thing and they're interested inwhat I'm doing and many of them are
astute dreamers and prolific dreamersand many open people in my experience
have archetypal dreams whereas peoplewho are lower in openness they either
don't dream at all or they don'tremember their dreams as much or they're
not interested in them and they're notinterested in the mythological
underpinnings of them so I've taughtpsychology roughly speaking to many
different types of people includinglawyers and lawyers and physicians and
they tend to be higher in tradeconscientiousness than in openness and
they're much more interested in thepractical applications of psychology and
maybe the big five theories than theyare in the narrative underpinnings and
you know people say that when they wentto um-- they had union dreams but I
don't and then when they went to Freudthey had Freudian dreams and I don't
really believe that's exactly true Ithink it was a matter of selection bias
a priori selection bias on the part ofthe people who were likely to go see
either of those two and so but I've beenstruck by some clients in particular how
unbelievably continually they cangenerate deep archetypal dreams with a
really coherent narrative structure it'sreally phenomenal and how revealing
those dreams our problem with archetypaldreams is that they're not really
personal right so if you're looking fora personal way out of a situation an
archetypal dream doesn't help you thatmuch because it gives you the general
pattern ratherthan a specific solution to your problem
but a good dream will do both at onceanyways yung was an astute student of
Freud's I will cover Freud next althoughgenerally and in personality courses the
the order is reversed Freud firstmenuing because of their temporal of the
temporal order of their thought but Ithink it's better to start with Jung
because it's it's as if you Freudexcavated into the basement and then
Jung excavated into many many floorsunderneath the basement of the mind and
so from if you're transitioning from anarchaic understanding of archaic modes
of thinking towards Freud it's better togo through young because Jung is I think
I think Freudian theory is a subset ofJungian Theory fundamentally just like
Newtonian physics is a subset ofEinstein Ian's physics and I think that
Freud knew that even to some degreealthough he was very much opposed to any
sort of religious thinking ormythological religious thinking I would
say he was a real 19th centurymaterialist and he didn't like the fact
that Jung's work started to delve intoreligious themes in a manner that
actually in some sense validated thosethemes and so that's actually why they
split they split when you published abook called symbols of transformation
Jung was also a deep student ofNietzsche Nietzsche wrote a book called
thus spake Zarathustra which is kind ofan Old Testament revelation poetry kind
of book it's a strange one and Iwouldn't recommend if you want to read
Nietzsche that you start with that onebut most people do but you get a seminar
on thus spake Zarathustra which is aboutI've got this wrong it's somewhere
between 700 and 1100 pages long and itonly covers the first third of the book
and thus spake Zarathustra is actuallyquite a short book and so well so you
can imagine how much you had to knowabout Nietzsche to derive that many
words out of that few words andNietzsche was a well an absolute
absolute genius and Jung was actuallytrying to answer the question that
Nietzsche posed fundamentally which iswhy part of the reason why it's
incorrect historically to consider him aFreudian he was so nietzsche basically
stated let's say explicitly thatscientific empiricism / rationalist
had resulted in the death of themythological tradition of the west
roughly speaking that's Nietzsche'scomment on the death of God and in that
comment he also said that the fact thatGod was dead was going to produce
tremendous idiy a tional and socialhistorical upheavals that would result
in the deaths of millions of people thatthat he didn't say all that in one place
it's it's spread between part of its inwill to power and and I can't remember
the source of the other one some of itsreferenced and thus spake Zarathustra
but Nietzsche believed that in order toovercome the collapse of traditional
values with the idea say of God as itscornerstone people would have to become
creatures that could produce their ownvalues as a replacement that we would
have to become capable of generatingautonomous values and Jung but but
that's easier said than done becausetrying to impose a set of values on
yourself is very difficult becauseyou're not very cooperative and you know
that if you try to get yourself to dosomething that you don't want to do or
that's hard you just won't do it and soit's not like you can just invent your
own values and then go along with thatthat just doesn't work and so what Jung
and the Freudians did Freud first Iwould say was to start looking to be
looking into people's fantasiesautonomous fantasies unconscious
fantasies to see if they could - and anddiscover that values bubbled up of their
own accord into those fantasies and youcan imagine for example if you've become
enamored of someone that you might startfantasizing about them and if you read
off the fantasy then you can tell whatyou're after and what you're up to and
so the motivational force composes thefantasy and Freud was more interested
not in a personal sense so in in so faras your fantasies might reveal your
personal history so for example if youhave a burst of negative emotion in the
clinical session there'll be a fantasythat goes along with that an association
of ideas that that that kind of manifestthemselves of their own accord and
they're not necessarily coherent andlogical they're linked by emotion that's
the free association technique inFreudian psychology and they also might
manifest themselves in dreams andfantasies and so Freud started doing the
analysis of these spontaneous let's callthem fantasies and Jung link that more
at Freud did this first with the oedipaloedipal
complex but then you linked upspontaneous fantasies and dreams with
with myth mythology and fantasy acrosshistory and of course Piaget did the
same thing from a completely differentstandpoint so and that a lot of that's
embedded in this movie so we might aswell just walk through it so the first
question might be well why is a lion aking right and because it makes sense to
people that a lion could be a king andof course a lion is an apex predator and
so which means it's at the top of thefood chain roughly speaking and it's
sort of golden like the Sun so that'salso useful and you know it has that
Mane that makes it look majestic and ofcourse it's very physically powerful and
it's it's and and and it's intimidatingand so it's something that you run away
from as well right or you're awestruckby so the fact that you know it's like
snail king just doesn't make any senseright but lion king that works and and
you got to think about those thingsbecause it's not self-evident why a lion
would work as a king but uh but a snailwouldn't but it fits in with the your
metaphorical understanding of the waythe world works much better and so the
Lion King makes sense and well and whenthings like that that aren't rationally
self-evident makes sense you have to askyourself in what metaphorical context do
they make sense so you have the LionKing now the movie opens with a sunrise
and the sunrise is equivalent to thedawn of consciousness so that in many
archaic stories the Sun was a hero likeHorus if I remember correctly was a
solar king but but Apollo in particularbut Apollo Greek Greek myth the idea was
that at the Sun was this was the thehero the hero who illuminated the sky in
the day and so heroism and illuminationand enlightenment are all tangled
together metaphorically and then atnight what would happen would be that
Sun would fight with the with the dragonof darkness basically or with evil all
night and then rise again victorious inthe morning and so it's a death and
rebirth theme and it's very very veryvery common mythological theme and the
reason the Sun is associated withconsciousness as far as I can tell is
that were not nocturnal creatures rightwe're awake during the day and we're
very very visual half our brain isdevoted to visual processing and to be
lightened and illuminated means todevelop to move towards a higher state
of consciousness and we naturally uselight symbolism to to represent that you
know like the light bulb on the top ofsomeone's head you know you don't say I
was in darkened when you learn somethingnew and so again that fits into this
underlying metaphorical substrate thatthat's I think deeply biologically
grounded but but also social or sociallygrounded so it's a new day it's the
start of a new day and a day dayactually means like French your name
means day the day trek in some sense andhow to comport yourself during the day
is the fundamental question the day isthe canonical unit of time and so you
have to know how to comport yourselfduring the day and part of that is a
journey from consciousness intounconsciousness and that's and that
return so like Apollo you you've youdescend into unconsciousness and then
re-emerge and of course that's notmetaphorical at all that's exactly what
you do you descend into the underworldof darkness and dreams and strange
things happen down there and so and thenyou awake if you're fortunate or
unfortunate depending on your state ofmind you awake in the morning and it's a
new day right and so the dream worldseems to help you sort out your thoughts
by the way if you keep people awake foran extended period of time then they
they they they lose their mindsessentially the dream that the
unconsciousness and the dream state seemabsolutely critical in the maintenance
of mental health although people don'texactly understand why it looks like
dreams might help you forget becauseforgetting is really important you just
can't really wait you just can'tremember everything that happened to you
gets today I'm cluttered that that youyou'd fall apart and so you reduce
things to the gist and when you're doingthat you pack them in it's like you
compress them in some sense you packthem into a smaller space and get rid of
everything that isn't relevant and thedream seems to not be part of that it
also seems to be a place where youdeeply encode learning that might have
been done that day which is somethingthat Freud actually noted in his
interpretation of dreams which is agreat book if you're ever gonna read a
book that Freud wrote the interpretationof Dreams is the proper one to read in
my estimation it's a brilliant book andit laid the groundwork for a lot of what
Jung did and so anyways that's how themovie starts and the animals come out in
to the light and that's that's ametaphor for the dawning of
consciousness to come out into the lightwhere you can see and so this is a baby
giraffe and babies emerge into the lightroughly speaking and that's that's like
I said that that's a representation ofthe emergence or expansion of
consciousness and so this is how themovie starts it starts a very expansive
music as wellcelebratory music and that's to indicate
to you to set the tone for the movie butalso to indicate to you that you're
about to watch something of import andthe opening scene is actually a real
scene of genius in my estimation theanimators did a great job and it goes
along very nicely with the music and soyou see this little a sand then you see
this rock Pride Rock I believe it'scalled and in the middle of it and it's
the center it's the center it's like thespot that's marked by a cathedral which
is an X or a cross and you're right inthe middle of that and so it's the
center of the light that's another wayof thinking about it or it's the center
of the territory or it's the home orit's the fire in the in the wilderness
or it's the tree in the center where youlive it's all of those things at once
it's inhabited territory with you at thecenter and the rock represents tradition
because people tend to inscribe theirtraditions on rock right or to build
them into rock like the pyramid so youcould think about that as a pyramid as
an Egyptian pyramid and it's the rightway to think about it
you could also think about it as adominance hierarchy with the apex
predator at the top and that's the lionso it makes sense that the lion would be
in the light on the rock that's apyramid in the middle of the territory
right that makes sense to peoplepsychologically so because that's what
the state is the state is a hierarchywith with something at the top that
occupies a space that has beenilluminated and made safe by
consciousness that's what the state isand that's all represented right away in
this movie and all the animals come toto observe what's happening in the
pyramid and at the top because they needto know what happens at the top
partly to organize their world that'sthe pyramid but also to see how the
organizational principle works andthat's why they're all gathering and so
they're gathering in the light in themorning to observe something new that's
going to be born that's of significantimportance and that's the birth of the
hero and this little bird here Zazuright
the zoo is like Horus the Egyptian Godwho was a Falken and an I at the same
time he is the Kings I in this Kingseyes in this movie right he flies up
above outside of the pyramid so he cansee everything that goes on and reports
to the King and so partly what thatindicates is that the thing that's at
the top of the pyramid needs to be aneye and that's partly why you see an eye
on the top of the pyramid on the back ofthe American dollar bill it's exactly
the same idea or if you look at theWashington Monument which is a pyramid
at the top you see that it's capped withaluminum and you think well why aluminum
and the answer to that was it was themost expensive metal at that time and so
the notion is is that at the top of thepyramid there's something that actually
doesn't belong in the pyramid it'ssomething that goes up above the pyramid
and can see everything and so you couldthink about it this way is that you're
gonna be in a lot of pyramids in yourlife dominance hierarchies and different
states and families and all of that andthey'll arrange themselves into a
hierarchy and there'll be something atthe top and the top is the thing that
can do well across hierarchies so it'snot stuck in any one pyramid it and it's
partly associated with vision and theability to see a long long distance also
to see what you don't want to see and toreport that back to the king and so the
king fundamentally as far as you guysare concerned from a psychological
perspective that's your super-egothat's the Freudian perspective or it
might be the moral system by which youcomport yourself but your eyes are the
thing that updates that right you needit to orient yourself in the world you
need it to orient yourself among otherpeople but your eye and your capacity to
pay attention especially to what youdon't want to pay attention to is the
thing that continually updates thatmodel exactly as Piaget laid out with
children so and all of that's packedinto the imagery in the first you know a
few minutes of this movie and that'sactually why it relies on imagery why
this isn't just a lecture by apsychologist you know when you go to see
the movie it's because the images theysay a picture is worth a thousand words
but and there's thousands of pictures inthis movie obviously but maybe a picture
is worth more words than you canactually use to describe it if the
pictures is is profound enough and wehave many many pictures like that
any deeply symbolic pictureis virtually inexhaustible in terms of
its of semantically with regards to itsexplanation images are very very dense
so anyways the animals all gather nowthe animals are also in representations
from the Freudian perspective and the itis the part of your psyche from the
Freudian perspective that's animalisticand and and full of of implicit drives
sexual and aggressive in particular asfar as Freud was concerned and that's
because those two drives say unlikethirst or hunger are much more difficult
to integrate into proper social beingand tend to be excluded and left
unconscious and so a lot of Freudianpsychology and I would say psychology in
general is focused on the integration ofsexual impulses and aggressive impulses
into the psyche I would also add to thatanxiety because anxiety is also a major
problem anxiety and negative emotionthat's pain like is also a major problem
for people and so the animals representthose it'd like impulses that have to be
organized hierarchically before you canbecome an integrated being and precisely
the piagetian manner right becausePiaget would say well the child comes
into the world with reflexes and maybe amore modern psychologists would also
concentrate on the implicit motivationsand those have to be organized inside
the child into some kind of hierarchy ofunity before the child can organize him
or herself into the broader unity of thestate and that's basically what's being
represented here and so so Zazu the eyesof the king comes to check out the King
and that's uh what's his name what's theKing's name Mufasa yeah and he's a very
regal looking person lion and he standsup straight and tall and that means that
he's high in serotonin because serotoningoverns posterior flexion and if so if
your dominant and near the top ofhierarchies you tend to expand so that
you look bigger than then you could ifyou shrunk down and so if you're low
dominant person you wander around likethis so that you look small and weak and
you don't pose a threat to anybody butif you're at the top you expand yourself
so that you can command the space andthat's why he has that particular kind
of regal posture and if you look at hisfacial expression you see that it's
quite severe it like he's he's capableof kindness but he's also
harsh and judgmental and that's whatsociety is like that's what the
super-ego is like and what that means isthat he's integrated his aggression and
I've seen this happen in my clinicalclients when they come in and they're
too agreeable they look like Simba lookslater in the movie when he's an
adolescent and he's sort of like a deerin headlights everything is coming in
and nothing is coming out but when theperson integrates their shadow and gets
the aggressive part of themselvesintegrated into their personality their
face is hardened and if you look atpeople you can tell because the people
who are too agreeable look childlike andinnocent and the people who well a hyper
aggressive person will look you knowmean and cruel but uh let's see if
that's good that's still working so butI've seen people's face changes change
face change in the course of therapy menand women so and what happens is they
start to look more mature and it's it'smore like they're they're judging the
world as well as interacting with itproperly once they integrate that more
disagreeable part of them it's very verynecessary that's part of the
incorporation of the Union shadow or theincorporation of the unconscious from a
Freudian perspective but old Musa Musathere he's already got that he's already
got that covered so and he's capable ofobviously he can smile and he's full
capable of the full range of expressionsbut he's a tough looking character and
and now this baboon here who's supposedto be basically just a fool when the
story was first written he turned intowhat's essentially a shaman across time
and so he represents the self from theUnion perspective now the self is
everything you could be across time soyou imagine that there's you and there's
the potential inside you whatever thatis you know and potential is an
interesting idea because it's representssomething that isn't yet real yet we act
like it's real because people will sayto you you should live up to your
potential and that potential is partlywhat you could be if you interacted with
the world in a manner that would gainyou the most information right because
you build yourself out of theinformation in the piagetian sense but
it's deeper than that - because we knowthat if you take yourself and you put
yourself in a new environment new genesturn on in your nervous system they
encode for new proteins and so you'refull of biological
tential that won't be realized unlessyou move yourself around in the world in
two different challenging circumstancesand that'll turn on different circuits
so it's not merely that you'reincorporating information from the
outside world in the constructivistsense it's that by exposing yourself to
different environments you put differentphysiological demands on on yourself all
the way down to the genetic level andthat manifests new elements of you and
so one of the things that happens topeople and this is a very common
cultural notion is that you should go ona pilgrimage at some point to somewhere
central and that would be say like therock in the Pride Rock and the Lion King
because you take yourself out of yourdopey little village and that's just a
little bounded you that everyone knowsand that isn't very expanded and then
you go somewhere dark and dangerous tothe central place and while you do that
you have adventures and they tough onyou and pull more out of you like partly
because you're becoming informed whichmeans in formation it means you're
becoming more organized at every levelof analysis but there's also more of you
too and so that's a very classic ideaand then in in cathedrals in Europe
especially at Chartres there's a bigmaze on the floor a circular maze which
is a symbolic representation of thepilgrimage for people who couldn't do it
and so it's a huge circle divided intoquadrants which is a union Mandela and
you enter the maze at one point and thenyou have to walk through the entire maze
north east west and south before you getto the center and the center is
symbolized by a flower that's carved instone it looks like this it's big this
maze a it's it's large so that you canwalk it and that's a symbolic pilgrimage
it takes you to the center that's thecenter of the cross because it's in a
Cathedral and that's the point ofacceptance of voluntary suffering that's
what that means and so you walk throughyou can call that a circumambulation you
go to all the corners of the world tofind yourself and so well the self is
the baboon in this particular in thispiece of mandrill actually in this
particular representation and he livesin the tree he lives in the tree of life
it's a bale bob tree in this particularso he's the spirit that inhabits the
tree of life and he's the eternal wiseman that's a way of thinking so is the
king buthe's sort of a superordinate king or an
outside king in some sense he's therepository of ancient wisdom and the
king is the manner in which that wisdomis currently being acted out in the
world and so they're friends and thatmeans that the king is a good king
because if they if the king was a badKing he would be alienated from himself
and that would make him shallow andone-dimensional and that would make him
a bad ruler no Union with the traditionsof the past to be a good ruler you have
to rescue your father from theunderworld and integrate that and of
course that's a main theme in thisentire movie so hey a new mystery to
solve
okay so the hero is born and that's whatthe Rising Sun represents and everybody
goes oh oh isn't that cute and thereason for that is because you're
biologically wired especially if you'reagreeable to respond with caretaking
activity - cute - cuteness and cutenessbutton nose big eyes small mouths round
head symmetry and helpless movements andyou'll respond to that across the entire
class of mammalian of mammaliancreatures even maybe down to lizards you
know isn't that cute it's no it's alizard but you know so so so that's an
archetype as well that's the archetypeof the vulnerable hero at Bohr the
vulnerable hero newly born and thatshould invoke a desire mostly on the
part of males to encourage and mostly onthe part of females to nur it to nurture
but males and females are quite crosswired among human beings and so there's
encouragement from the women and there'salso nurturing from the men and of
course those those curves in some senseoverlap so there's more nurturing males
and more encouraging females but that'sroughly the archetype and so he looks
cute and everybody goes on and that'sbecause the animators nailed that they
caught the essential features ofcuteness and he's also in the light
right and so then the shaman mandrelbasically baptizes him nots essentially
what he's doing and he uses somethingthat symbolic of the Sun which is this
ripe fruit and fruits are symbolic ofthe Sun because of course they need the
Sun to ripen and they're round like theSun and so and people know that they
need light but and and so anyways theanimators make a relationship between
the fruit that the shaman is going tobreak and the Sun and so he's also being
baptized into the Sun and that meansthat he's being baptized into the light
or that he's being transformed into ahero and so then everyone's happy and
that's basically you know the divinefather and the divine mother and the
divine son and the self who's takingcare of that and there's a union between
the baby and the wise old man becausethe baby is all the potential that's
realized in the self and there's an oldidea that the way to full maturity is to
find what you lost as a child and regainit it's a brilliant idea and that that
that echoes through mists allover the world and that means you have
to regain your capacity once you'redisciplined and you know how to do
something you have to regain yourcapacity for play and sort of for
wide-eyed wonder and that's maybe thechildlike part of your spirit and the
reintegration of that childlike partwith the adult grown-up part Reviva Faiz
the adult grown-up part and allows thechild to manifest itself in a
disciplined way in the world and sothat's all being hinted that there and
then they showed the shaman shows thebaby the newborn hero to the crowd and
it's very cool what happens in the movieall the animals spontaneously Neil and I
can give you an example of that kind ofspontaneous action in a crowd
it's imagine you're watching offgymnastics performance right and and
it's like at a high level world-classperformance and someone comes out there
and they do this routine that's justdead letter-perfect you know and they
stop and everybody claps like mad rightand it's perfect
and so then the next contestant comesout and they're basically in real
trouble because you know this personjust got nine point seven out of ten and
it was perfect so how do you beatperfect and so will they come out there
and then you watch them and you're righton the edge of your seat because what
you see them do is somethingextraordinarily disciplined just like
the last person did but they pushthemselves into that zone that's just
beyond their discipline capacity and youcan tell every second you're watching it
that they're that close to disaster andso you're right on the edge of your seat
and and you know that they're doing ahigh-wire act without a net and so when
they finally land triumphantly you'llall stand up and clap spontaneously and
it's because you've just witnessedsomeone who's a master at playing a game
who's also a master at improving how toplay that game at the same time and
people love that more than anything tosee that it's just absolutely
overwhelming because it's a testament tothe human spirit and you'll respond
automatically and unconsciously to thatand that's why that's an analogy to why
the animals all spontaneously bow whennow what happens is they shows the Lion
King and the Sun breaks and shines onthat the hero at the same time so
there's this concordance between anearthly event and a so-called heavenly
event and you would call thatsynchronous that's his idea of
synchronicity wheresomething important subjectively is also
signified by something that appears innarrative keeping with that in the
outside world that's one of the mostcontroversial elements of his theory but
I've experienced a variety ofsynchronous events and they often happen
in therapy especially around dreams butthey're very hard to communicate because
they're so specific to the context inwhich it occurs they're very difficult
to explain so anyways it's thesynchronous event that make drops all
the animals to their knees so there'sthe Sun coming out and there's shining
on them and all the primates go mad forthat and that's of course exactly what
we do when we applaud and then we switchto scar now scar is mufasa's brother
evil brother the king always has an evilbrother and so does the hero the hero
always has an adversary and the reasonfor that is the king always has an evil
brother and that means that the statealways has a tyrannical element and the
tyrannical element exists for tworeasons one is the state deteriorate of
its own accord and that's an entropyobservation what that means is that the
state is a construction of the pastright but the present isn't the same as
the past and to the degree that the pastis mismatched with the demands of the
present then it's then it's then it's atyrannical it's malfunctioning and so
it's it's a continual problem with thestate it's always two steps behind the
environment and so then that means thatthe awareness of living people has to
update the state and so Eliot and MariaEliot who's a great historian of
religions looked at flood stories fromall over the world because there are
flood stories from all over the worldpartly because there are floods all over
the world but that's there's apsychological reason to so imagine that
New Orleans was wiped out by a hurricaneright a flood didn't you say well that
was an act of God but then you thinkwait a second wait a second they knew
those dam dykes weren't gonna hold theyknew they weren't built strong enough
they took the money that was allocatedto the dikes and spent it badly and that
was willful blindness and so you couldsay that it was God who caused the flood
so to speak metaphorically but you couldalso say that it was the degeneration of
the state and the willful blindness ofthe politicians that call
the flood in Holland they build thedikes to withstand the worst storm in
10,000 years in the you southern US theybuilt them to withstand the worst storm
in a hundred years and they knew thatthat was insufficient and so the flood
if there's a flood well you can say wellthat's an act of nature but you can also
say just wait a sec maybe if there was aflood because we looked the other way
and because our systems were out of dateand that's why in flood stories there's
there's a continual theme which is thethe people get wiped out by the flood
because God judges them harshly fortheir senility and their willful
blindness and it's a story that's verymuch you'll have a flood in your life
right it'll be a flood of chaos andyou'll find of one form another and
you'll find when you investigate thecauses of the flood that some of it will
be and sometimes this is cake the caseit's just random
you just got singled out you got aterrible disease and that's the end of
you or something like that but there'llbe other situations where the flood
comes and you're surrounded by chaos andyou'll look into it you'll think I knew
this was coming I knew I wasn't payingattention I knew I hadn't sorted things
out and the consequences of that willhave cascaded and wiped you out and then
you're in real trouble because not onlydid you get wiped out but you also know
it's your fault and that is not a goodthing that makes you bitter and
resentful and murderous when thathappens so anyways scar is scarred right
so what that implies is he's had apretty rough life and he's kind of
skinny and he said he was born in thelow end of the gene pool and so he has
reasons to be resentfulhe's also hyper intelligent and rational
and it's one of the things you see verycommonly about the evil adversary of the
state or of the individuals oftenintelligent and hyper rational and the
best commentator on that was probablyJohn Milton and Paradise Lost because
that's how he represents Lucifer orSatan who's the spirit of rationality
and enlightenment strangely enough henceLucifer the bringer of light and the
reason for that as far as I can tell andthis is something that Milton figured
out when he compiled all these ancientstories about evil and tried to make
them coherent was that the problem withirrationality with rationality is that
it tends to fall in love with its ownproduct
right and so then it comes up with atheory that makes that a totality and
then it won't let go so the rationalmind has a totalitarian element and we
know that to some degree because thatkind of rationality seems more left
hemisphere focused and the lefthemisphere tends to impose structured
order on the world and be updated by theright hemisphere and the right
hemisphere generally updates it withnegative information and with fantasy
and so the left hemisphere will impose acoherent structure on the world which is
really necessary for you live in it butthe problem is there's a tension between
coherence and completeness and that'spartly why you need two hemispheres you
need one to represent the world and youneed one to keep track of the exceptions
and to feed those slowly into therepresentational system so that it so
that it can stay updated withoutcollapsing into complete chaos
so anyways scar and he's got this likedroopy mouth and this whiny arrogant
voice and he feels hard done by and he'sresentful and and in in classic heroes
stories stories of the state as well theso this is an Egyptian take on it Osiris
was was the god of the state and set wholater became Satan that name became
Satan as it transformed through CopticChristianity Osiris had a brother named
set and set he didn't pay attention toset enough attention and set was always
scheme scheming to overthrow the kingdomjust like scar is and the Egyptian said
straightforwardly that the reason thatOsiris got overthrown by said he got
chopped into pieces and his piecesdistributed throughout the state in the
mythological representation and thosepieces were actually the provinces of
Egypt technically speaking so and that'swhat the Egyptians thought so that's
quite cool but the Egyptians saidexplicitly that the reason that Osiris
got overthrown by set was because he waswillfully blind old senile and willfully
blind same idea as the flood myth youdon't see that quite here because Mufasa
is sort of on to set or to scar but scaris more treacherous than Mufasa believes
and he gets at he gets at Mufasa bygoing through his son by by by playing
on on the impulsivity and and juvenilequalities of his son
so obviously there's some antagonismbetween these two as you can see by
their facial expressions there and thereis a good example of scar you know he's
got that droopy kind of whiny malevolentface and that malevolent voice that
Jeremy Irons pulls off so incrediblywell and he's always skulking he's a
creature of the night he always skulksaround he's not a creature of the day in
any sense of the word and you knowobviously Mufasa is golden like the Sun
and scars dark like the night that'sanother thing another clue another hint
okay there's the tree that's The Tree ofLife we already talked about that I
think that represents the multiplelevels at which you exist simultaneously
all the way from the subatomic all theway up to the cosmic so to speak and
that's a different kind of dimension andthat's the that's the place that the
self inhabits and it can kind of move upand down those dimensions but anyways
that the shaman lives inside that treeand and that's our first introduction to
him basically but he's the spirit of theancient tree that's another way of
thinking about a very very commonelement in stories right the spirit of
the ancient tree and so all right so nowMufasa has taken taken Simba up to the
top of the pyramid right so that's thethe aluminum place let's say or the
place of the eye where you can reallysee a long ways and he's explaining to
him what his kingdom is going to be andyou see the Sun of course appears that
that to begin with and that's anotherhint about being at the top that's the
illuminated part of the pyramid and sothey're up there talking and what Mufasa
tells Simba is that his kingdom iseveryplace the light has touched and
that's so brilliant so one of the thingsyou'll notice if you move into a new
apartment you're like a cat cats don'tlike changing houses and they have to
zoom around in every corner to seeexactly what the hell's going on there
before they calm down they need to knowwhere they can hide and where the
potential dangers are and what you'llfind if you move into a new place that
you will not be comfortable there untilyou've investigated potentially cleaned
and repaired every single square inch ofit the more attention you pay to it the
more it'll become yours and that's farmore than mere like material ownership
which is also relevantbut in order to feel comfortable
somewhere and to dominate that place tobe in meshed in that place you have to
attend to it you have to shine light onevery corner and you have to do that
with yourself and with yourrelationships as well and so anyways
Mufasa tells Simba that his kingdom iseverything that the light shines on and
that's exactly right and then there's ametaphor there too which is that what
you've Shawn light on which is whatyou've come to understand and master is
surrounded by an Otherworld of all thethings that you don't understand and
some of those would be natural thingsand some of them would be tyrannical
things and some of those would be thingsyou don't want to know about yourself
but they're outside of where you'vemanaged to shine the light and so that's
exactly what Mufasa tells Simba says welive in this pyramid we're at the top
there's a domain of light around itthat's explored territory outside of
that there's explore unexploredterritory and that's partly the
unconscious because you fill it withfantasy and it's partly what you just
don't know and then Mufasa tells Simbaand it's sort of like God telling Adam
and even in the Garden of Eden not toeat the apple Mufasa tells Simba there's
that this outside place that's darkthat's not part of your kingdom and you
should not go there and that's reallyinteresting because Simba doesn't even
know about that place yet and so Mufasais doing something very contradictory
there it's like telling him that itexists and and heightening his curiosity
but also saying that he should go therealmost ensuring that that's exactly what
Simba is going to do you see this in thePinocchio movie to where Pinocchio is
planning to jump into the ocean to goget Geppetto from the underworld and
he's following his conscience is alongwith him Jiminy Cricket
and the cricket is warning him about allthe dangers that he'll face down there
and telling him that he will be fishfood personally and while he's doing
thatPinocchio ties a knot around his donkey
tail around a rock so he can sink andand the little cricket helps him tie the
knot so well he's warning him about theadventure he's going to undertake at the
same time he's encouraging him to do itand there's that paradoxical thing which
is that if you go outside what you knowit will cause a fall because it'll
damage your knowledge structures andyou'll go down into chaos and that can
really destroy you so you shoulddo it but by the same token if you do do
it and you do it successfully then thenew you that are' arises can be stronger
and more complete than the previous youso you should do it and you shouldn't do
it and that's anyone sensible says lookdon't bother right but sensible isn't
enough that's the thing you have to alsobe not sensible enough in order to live
and your typical hero and Harry Potteris a really good example is always a
rule breaker always but he you know therules he breaks are like there's
judicious nough speaking the hero breaksa rule in the service of a higher good
but he's still breaking the rules andthat's what puts them outside the
boundary of the social of the socialestablishment so now at this point Simba
also gets introduced to scar and thatthat that has two meanings one is that
scar is the tyrannical element of thestate and so as a child when you're
being socialized you encounter thetyranny of the state and one of the best
you can't yet there's no way around itone of the best examples of that is that
children are always running aroundhaving fun and they're really bubbly and
and impulsive and joyous and playful andthat causes a lot of trouble because
positive emotion is very disruptivethey'll run around and break things
they'll hurt themselves and they'll getinto trouble and so you're always saying
calm down sit down behave don't do thatand it's it's not because they're crying
or angry it's because there's a day I'mhappy and impulsive that no one can
stand them and so and so that's atyranny it's like that the state puts
puts pressure on you to regulate youremotions positive negative and positive
and it crushes you it crushes the lifeout of you a lot of it and so you end up
you know your age and you're all mopeybecause the holes especially because
you've been forced to sit down in schoolfor like 17 years you're all mopey and
it's no wonder you know you've had thespirit taken out of you by the process
of discipline but without that you'd becompletely useless so it's another one
of those paradoxical you know gifts andand catastrophes that you encounter as
you move through life so anyways Simbalook at how happy he is you know I mean
he doesn't know a damn thing he's sonaive you can tell but oh look it's my
uncle Scar it's like you know and thisis not a guy you smile at
clearly but he's all positive emotionand joy and enthusiasm and that's not
good because that means this charactercan take serious advantage of it and
that's exactly what he does and so scarpretends to be on his side which is what
a good pedophile always does by the wayand so you know you you take advantage
of the child's trusting nature andopenness in order to exploit them and
that's that's what horrible people dothat all the time including the parents
of children and other childrenthemselves so you know there's this
false I mean look at the animators areso damn brilliant Hey look at that
expression really like you know you justlook at that and you think well that's
just a facial expression but of courseit's not some damn animators worked
really hard to get that they're reallyobservant and they distill the facial
looks like the face is right it coversthe whole head and and they've got the
eyebrow lifts proper and they've gotthis horrible sanctimonious smile and
the tilt of the head then you know andhe's sort of crushing him while he's
hugging him at the same time and reallyreally and you know it took a lot of
thought for every single one of theseframes to be put together right there's
a tremendous amount of cognitive effortthat went into that so none of this is
accidentalyeah well that pretty much says
everything it's like whoo I hate thatkid and to hardly wait till he's gone
and didn't I pull one over on him youknow it's a real testament to an adult's
genius when he can fool a kid so thenSimba encounters the anima that's the
anima the Jungian anima and the anima isthe feminine counterpart in the soul and
she well yeah you could tell what shedoes to him right because she's got this
supercilious and and what would you sayjudgmental and teasing look on her face
and she's really trying to put him downand it's work it like bad he's not very
happy about that at all and she's thething this is what the anima does the
soul she's the thing that teaches theexploratory hero that that it's not
everything it could be right and that'spart of this can be read multiple ways
but it's part of the eternal tendency ofwomen to makes men self-conscious by
their sexual selectivity that's part ofit because that makes men self-conscious
like nothing else and it's also perhapsbeen one of the phenomena that's
produced the evolutionary arms race inthis in the
sex is among human beings that's causedour rapid cortical expansion and our
quick movement away from chimpanzees whoaren't selective mater's by the way so
look at him Jesus you just want to slaphim right he's a he's the son of a king
so he's very very privileged and heconfuses his privilege with competence
rich of course all of you do becauseyou're all sons of the King which is why
you can sit here in the university andyou confuse your privilege with
competence as well because it's not hasnothing to do with any of you that the
lights are on and that's the place is sopeaceful
right but you take that for granted andit can make you false and arrogant like
like Jesus that's just so sad you lookat that kid you think he's he's in for
real trouble man he thinks he knowseverything and of course then he has a
wrestling match with what's-her-namewhat's it was it Nala yeah he has a
wrestling match with Nala and she justpins him every time right gotcha again
pindy again and that's basically rightone of the things that happens with men
when they meet a woman who they reallydesire that Myers they project an idea
onto her immediately that's an animaprojection and then that Adam a
projection judges them and they act allinferior and stupid and it's partly
because they are that's why and so thenthey they go down in defeat constantly
to this thing that they're projectingwhich at least has some concordance with
the actual woman but not that much sookay they keep wrestling and then
they're on the fringe of the kingdomthis wrestling match between this pairs
of opposites takes them to the edge ofthe kingdom and they end up in the
elephant's graveyard right and andthere's there's bones everywhere and so
now they're out into the kingdom ofdeath and what that means is that these
two kids as they've grown up encounterdeath right they go outside the light
it's very very shocking for them they'revery curious about it obviously they go
to explore the skeletons and all of thateven though they were told not to but
their curiosity they can't stay awayfrom death they're too curious about it
and so they developed knowledge of deathand that and then of course out there in
the Deadlands is where the hyenas areand that's exactly right because hyenas
are scavengers right and they can breakbones with their teeth they're really
really quite the animal and you know youkind of have a shudder of repugnance
when you see those thingsand I think it's partly I mean we shared
an evolutionary landscape with theancestors of hyenas for a very very long
time and like vultures too you know youcouldn't imagine something that would be
more well designed to look like it was ahorrible thing than a vulture right and
there's this weird concordance and crowsand ravens are like that - carrion
eaters you know the Eagles are kind ofan exception but they look just as
creepy as they are which is really quiteinteresting and of course hyenas fall
into that category and they laugh -which is you know really you you also
have to laugh really with all theseother things you have going for you and
anyways the hyenas and hyenas areenemies of lions and they can take lions
down they're tough things and you knowthey're not one high in obviously but a
bunch of hyenas can give a lie in apretty damn rough time
and so and these little lines are reallyno match for the hyenas so they get
threatened very very rapidly and one ofthe hyenas of course is just completely
out of its mind and one of the thingsthat's really interesting and you see
this with the Muppets - there was oftena puppet that was like a crazy puppet
and its eyes would move in differentdirections you know and one of the
things that happens with people who areschizophrenic is they show involuntary
eye movements and it's because you havea brain center that controls your eyes
voluntarily and you have another onethat controls them involuntarily so you
can see that look ahead and try to moveyour eyes smoothly back and forth you
can't do it you'll see that they jerkhey but if you watch put a finger in
front of your face and then do thisthey'll move perfectly smoothly and
that's because you're using differenteye control centers one voluntary and
one more involuntary and the involuntaryone is actually more sophisticated and
so in schizophrenic the involuntary eyecontrol centers tend to disrupt the
voluntary eye control centers and that'slikely part of the hallucinatory process
you know because you have the ego inthis schizophrenic that's being
disrupted by processes underneathfantasies and that sort of thing and
that looks like it's reflected ininvoluntary eye movements like like
dream movements so anyways so much forthe crazy hyena and they're in real
trouble now the Kings I who's supposedto be keeping an eye on this and was
supposed to be watching Simba is tryingto intervene but I mean look at him he's
a like a delicious little bird and sothat's not working out very well
anyways and then you see this immediatejuxtaposition of the domain of death and
the hyenas with hell right and everyonelooks at that and they think well they
know exactly what that means it's nosurprise to anyone that that happens and
I suppose that's partly because on theveldt where we evolved in large part but
not by no means all part fire was anever-present danger in the grasslands
right and so and so that's a good that'sa good example of Hell so huh well I
guess that's it we'll do some more ofthis when we meet on Tuesday bye
you
