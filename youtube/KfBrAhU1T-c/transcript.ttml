<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">background because I think it would be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.690" end="00:04:41.900" style="s2">mistake to look at power the will to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:43.699" style="s2">accumulate power and to enact in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.900" end="00:04:47.419" style="s2">world without looking at individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.699" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">personal stories and motivations for</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.419" end="00:04:54.830" style="s2">growing in strength power capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:57.020" style="s2">usually each individual that I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:04:59.000" style="s2">who has accumulated significant power</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:01.220" style="s2">who has had the desire to do so has had</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.000" end="00:05:06.199" style="s2">certain impacts in their own life that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.220" end="00:05:08.180" style="s2">have prefigured that search and my story</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.199" end="00:05:11.210" style="s2">is no exception</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.180" end="00:05:12.979" style="s2">very very brief overview of deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.210" end="00:05:16.460" style="s2">childhood I was the first child first</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.979" end="00:05:18.889" style="s2">grandchild in accelerated classes very</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.460" end="00:05:20.330" style="s2">smart but very nerdy got picked on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.889" end="00:05:23.449" style="s2">in school and then systematically</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.330" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">rebuilt myself after a lot of really</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.449" end="00:05:29.860" style="s2">deliberate taunting and hazing over a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:32.840" style="s2">few years to become a class president</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.860" end="00:05:36.229" style="s2">captain of various teams star in</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.840" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">different plays really redirected my</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.229" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">intelligence from quite literally in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:44.090" style="s2">ritual one night at eleven from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">pursuit of goodness and knowledge to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.090" end="00:05:48.319" style="s2">pursuit of power and the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:50.990" style="s2">strength it was like a mirror ritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.319" end="00:05:52.639" style="s2">that I later checked and you know had</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.990" end="00:05:54.319" style="s2">some similarities to stuff that I had</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.639" end="00:05:57.729" style="s2">figured out in like Western magic books</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.319" end="00:06:00.469" style="s2">it was like these these strange echoes</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.729" end="00:06:03.289" style="s2">occur at key junctures throughout my</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.469" end="00:06:05.779" style="s2">life and I don&#39;t need to get too into</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.289" end="00:06:09.380" style="s2">the weeds here suffice to say that from</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.779" end="00:06:11.599" style="s2">11 to 13 I wrote a 13 page guide to</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.599" end="00:06:15.349" style="s2">for seven key traits that I saw as</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.090" end="00:06:24.319" style="s2">through my peers that was not a</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.319" end="00:06:29.779" style="s2">because it was built on raising like my</p>

<p begin="00:06:29.779" end="00:06:35.060" style="s2">second least popular in my elementary</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.029" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">school to number six out of 520 in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.060" end="00:06:37.939" style="s2">middle school and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:40.039" style="s2">I did get like that granular into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.939" end="00:06:41.810" style="s2">specifics like I was that hazed in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.039" end="00:06:44.419" style="s2">school that it was that important for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.810" end="00:06:46.580" style="s2">to figure out how to how to network and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.419" end="00:06:48.949" style="s2">how to understand these dynamics that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.580" end="00:06:52.039" style="s2">was so sorely lacking in at the age of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.949" end="00:06:54.349" style="s2">like 10 but it fell apart because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.039" end="00:06:56.840" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really based on a deeply embodied</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.349" end="00:06:59.479" style="s2">sense of interconnection and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.840" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">authentic presentation and that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.479" end="00:07:05.810" style="s2">coupled with my first mushroom trip at</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:08.860" style="s2">21 and that triggered a real coming to</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:11.539" style="s2">reality a really deep facing of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.860" end="00:07:13.460" style="s2">nature of my existence and it triggered</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.539" end="00:07:15.889" style="s2">both a spiritual awakening and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.460" end="00:07:18.080" style="s2">profound breakdown where I spent six</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.889" end="00:07:21.080" style="s2">months and then a year away from school</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.080" end="00:07:22.759" style="s2">rebuilding myself and reintegrating the</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.590" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">realized that over the years that I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.940" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">in finance and I realized that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:45.370" style="s2">the connections that I was making were</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:47.920" style="s2">fairly superficial</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.370" end="00:17:51.670" style="s2">and motivated not by the quality of my</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.920" end="00:17:54.760" style="s2">ideas but by connection to power so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.670" end="00:17:57.460" style="s2">had a group effect on my field it almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.760" end="00:17:59.470" style="s2">felt like the trace amounts of cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.460" end="00:18:05.020" style="s2">that are on every hundred dollar bill in</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.470" end="00:18:11.530" style="s2">long circulation so regardless of all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.020" end="00:18:14.110" style="s2">that I I stepped down from Finance</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.530" end="00:18:17.860" style="s2">gradually and stepped away from it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.110" end="00:18:22.210" style="s2">found myself more drawn to poetry to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.860" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">spoken word communication and to and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.210" end="00:18:26.800" style="s2">group holding and community building and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:30.010" style="s2">and found that the energies and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.800" end="00:18:33.990" style="s2">yogic states had a capacity to move</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.010" end="00:18:38.010" style="s2">through spoken word and freestyle</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.990" end="00:18:42.130" style="s2">vectors of communication and so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.010" end="00:18:45.130" style="s2">learned how to pedal down and transition</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.130" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">and actually take stock on how</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.130" end="00:18:53.260" style="s2">self-obsessed that I had been through a</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.070" end="00:18:55.809" style="s2">lot of my life and how how self-involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">a lot of these processes were and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.809" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">informed by trauma a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:04.270" style="s2">actually were and how the effects on</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:05.980" style="s2">other people and also the histories of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.270" end="00:19:08.230" style="s2">lot of people in the fields that I was</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.980" end="00:19:11.440" style="s2">in were impressed by their own childhood</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.230" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">trauma as well that drew a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:16.900" style="s2">to grow to states of power that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:21.309" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t otherwise have have gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.900" end="00:19:24.280" style="s2">so a lot of a lot of that backstory you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.309" end="00:19:26.620" style="s2">know I&#39;m not covering it up and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.280" end="00:19:30.100" style="s2">definitely willing to expand and explore</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.620" end="00:19:32.290" style="s2">and express in any vector that anybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.100" end="00:19:35.860" style="s2">would be interested in exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.290" end="00:19:38.110" style="s2">experiencing we live in an era where it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.860" end="00:19:41.050" style="s2">can be quite damaging and difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.110" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">tell the truth and to experience things</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.050" end="00:19:44.890" style="s2">directly we live in an era where like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:51.370" style="s2">people have a lot of very strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.890" end="00:19:54.460" style="s2">feelings about you know every everybody</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.370" end="00:19:57.720" style="s2">who is trying to attain a level of power</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.460" end="00:19:59.260" style="s2">and a level of influence and a level of</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.720" end="00:20:01.390" style="s2">visibility</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.260" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">and I&#39;ve had to reckon and continue to</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.390" end="00:20:09.090" style="s2">reckon with my own and I&#39;ve made many</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">mistakes in relating to others in</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:14.140" style="s2">leveraging the power imbalances that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:17.110" style="s2">felt but I&#39;ve also learned a lot through</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.140" end="00:20:18.700" style="s2">holding them and just want to tip my</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.110" end="00:20:21.340" style="s2">hand you know I&#39;ve played a lot of Poker</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.700" end="00:20:24.130" style="s2">I want to play my cards as face-up as I</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.340" end="00:20:26.410" style="s2">possibly can because that&#39;s not the game</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.130" end="00:20:29.470" style="s2">that I want to play and this is more</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.410" end="00:20:34.780" style="s2">than signaling and it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.470" end="00:20:37.990" style="s2">to me that I express that because this</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.780" end="00:20:42.040" style="s2">world is not in a great state and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.990" end="00:20:46.630" style="s2">don&#39;t know the answers but I know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.040" end="00:20:48.970" style="s2">higher higher signal and less noise and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.630" end="00:20:50.680" style="s2">like more actual truth and more deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.970" end="00:20:53.710" style="s2">emotions from people who have the chance</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.680" end="00:20:58.570" style="s2">to do things and and more vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.710" end="00:21:01.420" style="s2">is where people people like me and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.570" end="00:21:03.820" style="s2">people without convoluted histories and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.420" end="00:21:05.470" style="s2">backstories can actually learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.820" end="00:21:09.700" style="s2">serve other people and how to serve a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.470" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">collective so with that I&#39;d like to open</p>

<p begin="00:22:05.980" end="00:22:12.730" style="s2">many times it&#39;s rightly rightfully but a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.710" end="00:22:15.309" style="s2">a major resent</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.730" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2">demonization towards finance Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.309" end="00:22:22.179" style="s2">and people that hold power which I</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:25.299" style="s2">totally get I&#39;m curious what lessons did</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.299" end="00:22:32.620" style="s2">Street and in finance and having that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.130" end="00:22:34.210" style="s2">experience that that maybe those in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.620" end="00:22:39.730" style="s2">spiritual community that just turn away</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.210" end="00:22:42.370" style="s2">from it and dislike it that there could</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.730" end="00:22:44.650" style="s2">be they could be missing out on what</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.370" end="00:22:45.610" style="s2">wisdom is there and then also I guess in</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.650" end="00:22:48.100" style="s2">connection with that is like what do</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.610" end="00:22:50.890" style="s2">people get wrong in general and your</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.100" end="00:22:55.650" style="s2">experience about Wall Street finance and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.890" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">people with power in those realms okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.650" end="00:23:03.160" style="s2">so first off I was lucky to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:07.090" style="s2">firm that I was in you know it was less</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.160" end="00:23:09.160" style="s2">Gordon Gekko than grad school it was it</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.090" end="00:23:10.740" style="s2">was somewhat somewhat nerdy somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">self-involved within like a narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.740" end="00:23:16.870" style="s2">parameter and way of seeing the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:20.169" style="s2">but the head of the firm had a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.870" end="00:23:25.809" style="s2">strong commitment at least in his</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.169" end="00:23:26.530" style="s2">worldview to truth and to basically to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.809" end="00:23:29.230" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.530" end="00:23:32.140" style="s2">to to market behavior as since making</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.230" end="00:23:34.510" style="s2">and to updating his reality and learning</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.140" end="00:23:34.929" style="s2">as much as possible and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.510" end="00:23:37.299" style="s2">you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.929" end="00:23:39.220" style="s2">we were we were long-term value</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.299" end="00:23:41.620" style="s2">investors so we weren&#39;t short-term</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.220" end="00:23:44.980" style="s2">trying to profit off of market movements</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.620" end="00:23:47.290" style="s2">or day traders or that level of gambling</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.980" end="00:23:49.179" style="s2">we never worked off of insider</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.290" end="00:23:54.690" style="s2">information but we did all that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.179" end="00:23:57.669" style="s2">legally possible to visit companies tour</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:23:59.280" style="s2">entire industries talk to as many former</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.669" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">employees as possible about</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.280" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">non-confidential topics but it was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.900" end="00:24:05.169" style="s2">like doing homework and the work that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:07.960" style="s2">was asked to do and that all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.169" end="00:24:10.690" style="s2">analysts were asked to do is seven three</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.960" end="00:24:14.140" style="s2">grade math it&#39;s not very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.690" end="00:24:18.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have to put it up on a pedestal</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.140" end="00:24:20.740" style="s2">whatsoever but that coupled with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.130" end="00:24:25.960" style="s2">of reporting due diligence reporting and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.740" end="00:24:27.170" style="s2">essay writing so I would I would take</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.960" end="00:24:30.350" style="s2">calls and just</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.170" end="00:24:32.060" style="s2">that into core information about a</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.350" end="00:24:34.820" style="s2">certain company or a certain industry</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.060" end="00:24:39.640" style="s2">talk to all the competitors compare it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.820" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">with like global comps and use that to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.640" end="00:24:45.680" style="s2">gain an information advantage on what</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:49.010" style="s2">the what the markets are currently</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.680" end="00:24:51.830" style="s2">saying you know the the the funnest part</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.010" end="00:24:54.020" style="s2">of my job was VC investing because then</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.830" end="00:24:55.940" style="s2">you get to be a part of something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.020" end="00:24:58.460" style="s2">might not otherwise exist in the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.940" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">that had a lot more life in it and more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.460" end="00:25:04.430" style="s2">impressive personalities but like any</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:07.310" style="s2">competitive game you want to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.430" end="00:25:10.340" style="s2">places with fewer players or you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.310" end="00:25:12.860" style="s2">be in the places where there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.340" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">uncertainty so I specialized in Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.860" end="00:25:19.100" style="s2">India China you know the the the BRIC</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">companies were where countries were</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.100" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">where we had the most advantage and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.770" style="s2">where somebody without a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:27.040" style="s2">background in the industry could come</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.770" end="00:25:29.870" style="s2">and make a lot of contacts very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.040" end="00:25:31.910" style="s2">Brazil was in particular great for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.870" end="00:25:33.890" style="s2">because there&#39;s such an open people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.910" end="00:25:36.710" style="s2">kind of a telenovela everybody loves to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.890" end="00:25:38.270" style="s2">gossip and make friends and so the more</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.710" end="00:25:41.150" style="s2">information and the more connections you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.270" end="00:25:43.510" style="s2">can get the more access to opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.150" end="00:25:46.550" style="s2">or as warren buffett puts it deal flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.510" end="00:25:50.270" style="s2">you&#39;re given so a lot of it was based on</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.550" end="00:25:53.540" style="s2">reputation we were a large firm so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.270" end="00:25:55.370" style="s2">had the potential to alter people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.540" end="00:25:56.900" style="s2">lives with the money that we could move</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.370" end="00:25:59.540" style="s2">and so people were more forthcoming to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.900" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">talk to us smaller firms don&#39;t get that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.540" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">kind of access now the head of the firm</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.470" style="s2">is an interesting character I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:09.170" style="s2">going to talk to about him that much</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.470" end="00:26:14.300" style="s2">because he prefers to remain private</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.170" end="00:26:17.450" style="s2">but very he puts his money in the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.300" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">place you know he basically tie this to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.450" end="00:26:20.480" style="s2">environmental charities that he hand</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.980" end="00:26:22.280" style="s2">picks that are like running themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.480" end="00:26:26.330" style="s2">like businesses or running the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.280" end="00:26:28.970" style="s2">like a renewable sustainable business so</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.330" end="00:26:31.700" style="s2">at least in his mind he&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.970" end="00:26:33.620" style="s2">sensitive open and though he crunches</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.700" end="00:26:38.900" style="s2">probably 300 pages of information per</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.620" end="00:26:40.669" style="s2">day he makes his decisions based on his</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.900" end="00:26:43.369" style="s2">subconscious based on into it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.669" end="00:26:45.889" style="s2">needs to keep that channel clear and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.369" end="00:26:48.859" style="s2">job of the you know dozen or so people</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.889" end="00:26:50.690" style="s2">who work for him is to order that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.859" end="00:26:53.629" style="s2">information in a way that he could end</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.690" end="00:26:56.239" style="s2">up making the proper decision that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.629" end="00:26:59.869" style="s2">information is clear signal and accurate</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.239" end="00:27:03.889" style="s2">that it is broad and widely resourced</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.869" end="00:27:05.509" style="s2">and that it allows his intuition to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.889" end="00:27:07.489" style="s2">the right choice because at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.509" end="00:27:09.739" style="s2">the day you can argue that the mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.489" end="00:27:12.350" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually make decisions it just</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.739" end="00:27:14.809" style="s2">presents different outcomes in different</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.350" end="00:27:16.249" style="s2">different weights and that the will to</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.809" end="00:27:19.759" style="s2">make a choice comes from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.249" end="00:27:22.269" style="s2">different I will say structure power</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.759" end="00:27:24.499" style="s2">structure of it it was more feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.269" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">the full analysts were kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.499" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">Knights going off into different sectors</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:34.220" style="s2">or territory claiming land and the</p>

<p begin="00:28:14.570" end="00:28:21.950" style="s2">experience experience that so I am</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.480" end="00:28:26.029" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting questions in</p>

<p begin="00:28:30.889" end="00:28:36.499" style="s2">relationships energetics and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.529" end="00:28:38.600" style="s2">Ariel&#39;s question is interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.499" end="00:28:41.179" style="s2">so I would like to call on Arielle to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.600" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">ask her question and we&#39;ll go to engine</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.179" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">afterward</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.830" end="00:28:53.800" style="s2">hey yeah this is all super fascinating I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.390" end="00:28:56.590" style="s2">just be really curious to hear more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.800" end="00:28:57.850" style="s2">specifics about how those polarities you</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.590" end="00:28:59.620" style="s2">were discussing being married within</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.850" end="00:29:02.530" style="s2">yourself like a feminine spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.620" end="00:29:08.620" style="s2">the money power masculine uh like</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.530" end="00:29:12.660" style="s2">impacted love and dating absolutely well</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.620" end="00:29:18.970" style="s2">it&#39;s there there&#39;s a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.660" end="00:29:22.060" style="s2">involved here and I I&#39;ll say first off I</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.970" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">was learning as much as I could to</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.060" end="00:29:25.990" style="s2">expand myself to hold the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:29.110" style="s2">Finance</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.990" end="00:29:30.910" style="s2">it was jarring to my system coming from</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.110" end="00:29:34.630" style="s2">no money and then being with these like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.910" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">really directed personalities some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.630" end="00:29:39.880" style="s2">them with more capacity to hold</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:43.990" style="s2">attention than most of the monks that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.880" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">had met like very very centered balanced</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.990" end="00:29:49.720" style="s2">equanimous focused on their goal and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:52.210" style="s2">with really systemic lives so their</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.720" end="00:29:56.170" style="s2">energy was moving through my spine and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.210" end="00:29:58.570" style="s2">received them similarly to a Tantra guru</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.170" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">like it was just a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.570" end="00:30:03.280" style="s2">energy moving through my system now that</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:07.000" style="s2">was coupled with like the receptivity</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">that I&#39;d experienced in in finance and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.000" end="00:30:14.790" style="s2">was still drawn to two women and when</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:17.920" style="s2">men but mostly women with really open</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.790" end="00:30:21.850" style="s2">systems with really direct system so</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.920" end="00:30:25.240" style="s2">like dating dating was interesting you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.850" end="00:30:26.860" style="s2">know for the first couple of years in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.240" end="00:30:29.260" style="s2">finance I was really recovering from</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.860" end="00:30:31.420" style="s2">illness and from the intense</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.260" end="00:30:35.050" style="s2">psychological impact of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.420" end="00:30:37.570" style="s2">practices that I&#39;d experienced in Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.050" end="00:30:39.970" style="s2">and abroad I I didn&#39;t do much dating</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.570" end="00:30:44.470" style="s2">when I lived in Boulder when I lived in</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.970" end="00:30:46.660" style="s2">New York it opened up a lot and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.470" end="00:30:50.020" style="s2">avenues but largely through the ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.660" end="00:30:53.429" style="s2">dance scene so I didn&#39;t really date in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.020" end="00:30:58.030" style="s2">the finance sphere it was a bit closed</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.429" end="00:30:59.650" style="s2">to me a lot of it is married to upper</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.030" end="00:31:03.970" style="s2">crust New York</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.650" end="00:31:06.430" style="s2">and it was also a little bit foreign to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.970" end="00:31:08.620" style="s2">my nervous system so working in finance</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.430" end="00:31:10.600" style="s2">there was a lot of tension moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.620" end="00:31:15.940" style="s2">through my system and I longed to have</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.600" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">like really open experiences and flow it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.940" end="00:31:20.860" style="s2">it felt like a double life and I felt</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:22.510" style="s2">like a double agent and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.860" end="00:31:25.570" style="s2">understand finance from the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.510" end="00:31:29.920" style="s2">make shifts but I wanted to date women</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.570" end="00:31:31.960" style="s2">who is serious about deepening into yoga</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.920" end="00:31:34.750" style="s2">caring about the world caring about</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.960" end="00:31:40.570" style="s2">energy and life and that was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.750" end="00:31:43.870" style="s2">drawn to in my personal life and I found</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.570" end="00:31:47.680" style="s2">that it was an interesting a really</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.870" end="00:31:50.410" style="s2">interesting feel just like having never</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.680" end="00:31:53.860" style="s2">really had a lot of attractions to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.410" end="00:31:56.620" style="s2">beforehand in my life and being insecure</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.860" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">about my own mental state or being</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.620" end="00:32:00.910" style="s2">insecure about where money was going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:05.410" style="s2">come from I remember selling a poem for</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.910" end="00:32:09.400" style="s2">food like when I was 22 or 23 because I</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.410" end="00:32:13.150" style="s2">was just like that short up to being</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.400" end="00:32:15.550" style="s2">able to treat anybody to whatever meals</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.150" end="00:32:17.680" style="s2">or whatever experiences and just not</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.550" end="00:32:20.170" style="s2">more important than that was not having</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.680" end="00:32:22.540" style="s2">any anxiety in my body the shift to</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.170" end="00:32:24.250" style="s2">having a fully relaxed like root system</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.540" end="00:32:27.160" style="s2">and having the lower tiers of Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.250" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">hierarchy of needs shored up created</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.160" end="00:32:35.710" style="s2">just a real phase shift so it was I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:37.510" style="s2">finally experiencing this kind of magic</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.710" end="00:32:40.120" style="s2">and physical magic but my heart wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.510" end="00:32:42.910" style="s2">fully open to it and part of that heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.120" end="00:32:44.820" style="s2">not being open was also I didn&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.910" end="00:32:50.650" style="s2">believe in what I was doing in finance</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.820" end="00:32:52.840" style="s2">and I wasn&#39;t finding people to date or I</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.650" end="00:32:55.180" style="s2">wasn&#39;t in the right state and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:32:58.270" style="s2">combination thereof like when I lived in</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.180" end="00:33:00.280" style="s2">Boulder there would be regular energetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.270" end="00:33:02.590" style="s2">transmissions on the energy to energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.280" end="00:33:06.010" style="s2">level and when I moved to New York I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.590" end="00:33:06.700" style="s2">found that being sexualized just so very</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.010" end="00:33:09.850" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.700" end="00:33:13.040" style="s2">it was quite jarring for me at first how</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.850" end="00:33:15.530" style="s2">people would like experience this energy</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.040" end="00:33:20.210" style="s2">escalate physically and it took about</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.530" end="00:33:22.810" style="s2">six months to to really experience and</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.210" end="00:33:29.030" style="s2">live in that scene without being jarred</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.810" end="00:33:31.220" style="s2">but I would say I wish I had the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.030" end="00:33:32.840" style="s2">fortitude to choose more long-distance</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.220" end="00:33:35.390" style="s2">relationships and to choose more</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.840" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">commitments because a lot of the dating</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.390" end="00:33:39.380" style="s2">was just for a month or just for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.180" style="s2">couple of weeks until my emotional</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.380" end="00:33:45.770" style="s2">traumas were triggered and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.180" end="00:33:47.570" style="s2">find some regular pretext that it would</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.770" end="00:33:49.730" style="s2">that it would blow up or not work or</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.570" end="00:33:52.430" style="s2">prime people not to make commitments</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.730" end="00:33:55.150" style="s2">because I had to fly to China or I had</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.430" end="00:33:59.560" style="s2">to go here or I had to do this in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.150" end="00:34:02.090" style="s2">it it was difficult to going back into</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.560" end="00:34:03.740" style="s2">into work and toughening up because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.090" end="00:34:06.590" style="s2">experienced it almost like a corset</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.740" end="00:34:09.080" style="s2">being fastened on my chest and my</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.590" end="00:34:12.740" style="s2">abdomen going into work so I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.080" end="00:34:15.320" style="s2">deliberately go to ecstatic dances and</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.740" end="00:34:18.800" style="s2">to like these really more open groups to</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.320" end="00:34:20.840" style="s2">just like re release the tension that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.800" end="00:34:23.330" style="s2">had built up during the day that I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.840" end="00:34:26.120" style="s2">literally taking on from my peers my</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.330" end="00:34:28.419" style="s2">boss loved me and I remember an acid</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.120" end="00:34:31.970" style="s2">trip and the Metropolitan Museum of Art</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.419" end="00:34:35.150" style="s2">very shortly after joining the firm in</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.970" end="00:34:37.820" style="s2">New York I left and I looked down the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.150" end="00:34:40.100" style="s2">avenue of poets in Central Park and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.820" end="00:34:42.500" style="s2">looked at this building this is where</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.100" end="00:34:44.810" style="s2">Moloch really comes in to the question</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.500" end="00:34:46.870" style="s2">in the chat I saw it rising like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.810" end="00:34:50.750" style="s2">monolith from the Planet of the Apes</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.870" end="00:34:53.960" style="s2">from the from Cleopatra&#39;s Needle or</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.750" end="00:34:57.890" style="s2">whatever the the obelisk is in Central</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.960" end="00:34:59.900" style="s2">Park and I saw like the four hundred</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.890" end="00:35:01.790" style="s2">Lions from the top of the building where</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.900" end="00:35:03.500" style="s2">I work just like moving out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.790" end="00:35:06.470" style="s2">connecting to these wealthy families all</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.500" end="00:35:09.620" style="s2">over the world that we were serving and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.470" end="00:35:11.360" style="s2">I heard like it literally felt like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.620" end="00:35:14.030" style="s2">voice like this was raw</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.360" end="00:35:16.490" style="s2">speaking to me like it was saying you</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.030" end="00:35:19.040" style="s2">are here to serve these these wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.490" end="00:35:20.810" style="s2">chosen and then if you do successfully</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.040" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">your children will be among their number</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.810" end="00:35:26.840" style="s2">and I remember just like taking that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:29.120" style="s2">trip and just like walking</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.840" end="00:35:32.690" style="s2">twelve miles back to Brooklyn not saying</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.120" end="00:35:34.790" style="s2">yes not saying no previously I&#39;d been in</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.690" end="00:35:36.770" style="s2">the museum was just like seeing all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.790" end="00:35:38.690" style="s2">funerary masks of the Dead Kings and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.770" end="00:35:40.400" style="s2">being like this is the afterlife that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.690" end="00:35:43.130" style="s2">they were looking for but there was one</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.400" end="00:35:46.460" style="s2">piece that most resonated in my psyche</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.130" end="00:35:49.100" style="s2">which was this African King with a great</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.460" end="00:35:51.320" style="s2">golden staff to the side and that staff</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.100" end="00:35:54.890" style="s2">was for his chief adviser who was there</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.320" end="00:35:56.510" style="s2">to clean and clear the energy from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.890" end="00:35:58.100" style="s2">King so that he could make worthy</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.510" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">decisions and I looked at it was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.100" end="00:36:03.380" style="s2">fuck that&#39;s me that&#39;s that&#39;s my primary</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:04.820" style="s2">job here I&#39;m gonna find some good</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.380" end="00:36:07.460" style="s2">investments I&#39;m gonna find some bad</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.820" end="00:36:11.270" style="s2">investments but I&#39;m here to clean the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.460" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">energy and you know when I moved from</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.270" end="00:36:15.410" style="s2">Boulder to New York I saw myself as this</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:18.710" style="s2">living crystal on the grid line of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.410" end="00:36:21.590" style="s2">Manhattan trying to help clear and reset</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.710" end="00:36:23.120" style="s2">the energy there and it was it was a big</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.590" end="00:36:26.690" style="s2">task and people from Boulder were like</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.120" end="00:36:29.570" style="s2">good luck and I I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.690" end="00:36:33.770" style="s2">effective that I was when I was there</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.570" end="00:36:35.090" style="s2">and I know that I&#39;ve moved on from from</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.770" end="00:36:36.740" style="s2">dating and I&#39;m talking about some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.090" end="00:36:39.160" style="s2">these energetic dynamics I hope it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.740" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">too off course Tyson</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.160" end="00:36:47.750" style="s2">no thank you Ariel do you have any</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:55.460" style="s2">question is most alive at this point</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.180" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">sorry for spamming the chat I&#39;ve waited</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:37:00.770" style="s2">so long to talk to somebody who&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:05.840" style="s2">on the inside of Finance and Wall Street</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.770" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">and I feel like like so much thought is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.840" end="00:37:09.770" style="s2">spent thinking about how could we craft</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:11.660" style="s2">a different world this rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.770" end="00:37:14.180" style="s2">Moloch that comes out of Finance of Wall</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:15.770" style="s2">Street and said have somebody who&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.180" end="00:37:17.570" style="s2">in the sausage factory even though it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.770" end="00:37:20.470" style="s2">seems like your experiences a little</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.570" end="00:37:23.660" style="s2">different than the most is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.470" end="00:37:25.700" style="s2">incredible I don&#39;t know which of the</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.250" end="00:37:39.510" style="s2">yeah the the Moloch and the economic</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:44.850" style="s2">inequality or is Maalik first yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.050" end="00:37:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s good maybe go to Moloch first and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.850" end="00:37:49.350" style="s2">then we&#39;ll move on to the question that</p>

<p begin="00:38:16.410" end="00:38:21.540" style="s2">of the world into capital it is quite</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.400" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">low-hanging fruits right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.580" end="00:42:10.970" style="s2">personal healthcare is a must and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:13.190" style="s2">because the one of the folks one of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.970" end="00:42:16.480" style="s2">focuses of government is to crack down</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.190" end="00:42:19.220" style="s2">on undue monopolies monopolies of power</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:21.290" style="s2">pay-to-play system systems where you</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.220" end="00:42:22.550" style="s2">have to take place and the owners of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.290" end="00:42:24.890" style="s2">that system can charge whatever price</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.550" end="00:42:27.140" style="s2">they want everyone has a monopoly over</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.890" end="00:42:29.180" style="s2">their own health so anybody will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.140" end="00:42:30.860" style="s2">incented to pay whatever price they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.180" end="00:42:32.990" style="s2">and you see that what&#39;s Corelli and the</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.990" end="00:42:39.740" style="s2">you see that all over all over the board</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.390" end="00:42:42.440" style="s2">another thing is defending the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.740" end="00:42:45.620" style="s2">so defending the ecological Commons like</p>

<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:25.630" style="s2">where where have you been discouraged</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.420" end="01:02:29.890" style="s2">from creating value in your lives and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.630" end="01:02:31.150" style="s2">sharing it with others and given the</p>

<p begin="01:02:31.150" end="01:02:42.550" style="s2">what are actionable steps that you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:45.460" style="s2">create that value in in a way that can</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.550" end="01:02:47.500" style="s2">move the world into a sustainable and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.460" end="01:02:50.410" style="s2">inspiring direction and I know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.500" end="01:02:52.990" style="s2">that&#39;s not quite on the topic but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.410" end="01:02:57.400" style="s2">just what&#39;s what&#39;s burning in me I guess</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.990" end="01:03:00.970" style="s2">the the distillation of that is how can</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.400" end="01:03:04.510" style="s2">how can we transition from toxic</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.970" end="01:03:09.160" style="s2">self-serving power to a sense of power</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.510" end="01:03:11.890" style="s2">which empowers yourself and others how</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.160" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">can you sustainably unlock that within</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.890" end="01:03:15.130" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:19.180" style="s2">to empower a different story and a</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:22.690" style="s2">different vision within this world that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.180" end="01:03:24.490" style="s2">we all share yeah that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.690" end="01:03:26.349" style="s2">thank you and I&#39;m inspired</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.490" end="01:03:28.359" style="s2">Duncan by you talking about your</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.349" end="01:03:31.390" style="s2">experience and I&#39;m just like billing</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.359" end="01:03:32.819" style="s2">being willing to explore the times where</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.390" end="01:03:36.279" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.819" end="01:03:38.650" style="s2">you face like the temptations of power</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.279" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">and then how that reveals in me to think</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.650" end="01:03:47.920" style="s2">about the moments where I have where I</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:50.680" style="s2">have an even in small sort of contexts</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.920" end="01:03:52.750" style="s2">and situations seeks to leverage my</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.680" end="01:03:55.299" style="s2">personal power too for my own personal</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.750" end="01:03:58.630" style="s2">gain even potentially at someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.299" end="01:04:00.900" style="s2">expense and so I think for me what is</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.630" end="01:04:03.789" style="s2">happening here that is meaningful is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.900" end="01:04:06.190" style="s2">when those experiences those moments</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.789" end="01:04:09.250" style="s2">those temptations desires come up to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.190" end="01:04:10.630" style="s2">talk about it like to be open and honest</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.250" end="01:04:13.569" style="s2">I&#39;m experienced in this because I got my</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.630" end="01:04:16.299" style="s2">own fantasies and desires and things</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.569" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">around power and feeling powerful that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.299" end="01:04:22.059" style="s2">are less virtuous and less healthy hmm</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:24.490" style="s2">and so I do personally want to keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.059" end="01:04:27.190" style="s2">myself with like beauty and truth and</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.490" end="01:04:30.759" style="s2">goodness as a compass yeah but and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.190" end="01:04:32.710" style="s2">yeah go ahead no that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.759" end="01:04:34.509" style="s2">probably much more useful to bring into</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.710" end="01:04:36.039" style="s2">the breakout rooms yes your questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.509" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">good and what I wanted to encourage was</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.039" end="01:04:39.759" style="s2">everyone to take this as an opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:43.210" style="s2">to talk about your personal experiences</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.759" end="01:04:46.509" style="s2">with that with power when you had power</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.210" end="01:04:48.460" style="s2">and when you used it in one way or</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.509" end="01:04:50.619" style="s2">another in a way that felt good and</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.460" end="01:04:53.259" style="s2">right or maybe a way that felt kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.619" end="01:04:55.690" style="s2">wrong and dirty and I think by allowing</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.259" end="01:04:58.690" style="s2">ourselves to get personal with it that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.690" end="01:05:00.910" style="s2">will help us answer or at least create</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.690" end="01:05:02.309" style="s2">ideas and and deeper questions around</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.910" end="01:05:04.779" style="s2">Duncan&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.309" end="01:05:07.859" style="s2">and and and that level of self</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.779" end="01:05:09.670" style="s2">acknowledgement you&#39;re you&#39;re all beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.859" end="01:05:11.980" style="s2">probability dictates that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.670" end="01:05:16.779" style="s2">beings with moral compass and maybe one</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.980" end="01:05:23.049" style="s2">of you has different neuro chemistry but</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.779" end="01:05:25.599" style="s2">like so she sociopathy is where you</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.049" end="01:05:26.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t that sense of consciousness are</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.599" end="01:05:28.390" style="s2">in conscience</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.380" end="01:05:31.210" style="s2">to the point where that feedback</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.390" end="01:05:33.340" style="s2">mechanism doesn&#39;t take place and if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.210" end="01:05:34.660" style="s2">feel ashamed of your use of power there</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.340" end="01:05:37.120" style="s2">will be a subtle voice saying don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.660" end="01:05:39.330" style="s2">accumulate power don&#39;t grow a powerful</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.120" end="01:05:41.290" style="s2">but if you listen to that voice without</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.330" end="01:05:43.510" style="s2">re-experiencing even like childhood</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.290" end="01:05:44.920" style="s2">trauma of like I took the sugar when I</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.510" end="01:05:47.740" style="s2">was three and so I&#39;ll never do anything</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.920" end="01:05:50.920" style="s2">bad again or like take the sugar like</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.740" end="01:05:53.350" style="s2">and you didn&#39;t that that limits your</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.920" end="01:05:55.630" style="s2">capacity to enact and listen to that</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.350" end="01:05:58.150" style="s2">voice and listen and actually grow</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.630" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">strong and virtuous but it actually does</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.150" end="01:06:06.730" style="s2">take speaking about it to to make that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:09.790" style="s2">place open and real so if you feel that</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.730" end="01:06:12.790" style="s2">trust it&#39;s so valuable especially as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.790" end="01:06:14.770" style="s2">person of virtue to to acknowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.790" end="01:06:17.830" style="s2">speak where your virtues have been</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.770" end="01:06:20.290" style="s2">lacking and it&#39;s it&#39;s a journey for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.830" end="01:06:23.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s an ongoing journey for me but</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.290" end="01:06:24.900" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s one that I&#39;m really grateful</p>

<p begin="01:06:54.430" end="01:07:00.040" style="s2">thinking about that as the refrain for</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.080" end="01:07:03.720" style="s2">rap battles where as freestyle and my</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.040" end="01:07:06.700" style="s2">sessions on Monday as a opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.720" end="01:07:08.440" style="s2">argumentation healthy argumentation</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.700" end="01:07:09.880" style="s2">rather than battling one another and</p>
