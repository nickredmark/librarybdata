<p begin="00:00:00.470" end="00:00:04.519" style="s2">hi my name is Joe brewer and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.139" end="00:00:06.769" style="s2">share with you another book that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.519" end="00:00:09.260" style="s2">read that is helpful for anyone trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.769" end="00:00:11.600" style="s2">to create large scale social change by</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.260" end="00:00:14.450" style="s2">looking at the patterns of culture this</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.600" end="00:00:16.010" style="s2">book is called war and peace and war the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.450" end="00:00:18.980" style="s2">rise and fall of Empires by Peter</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.010" end="00:00:21.409" style="s2">turchin Peter torsion is a population</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.980" end="00:00:24.199" style="s2">ecologist so he&#39;s trained in biology and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.409" end="00:00:26.329" style="s2">he studies the patterns of history using</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.199" end="00:00:29.150" style="s2">mathematical models and what he does in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.329" end="00:00:31.789" style="s2">this book is he explores the way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.150" end="00:00:34.670" style="s2">empires have risen and fallen over time</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.789" end="00:00:37.550" style="s2">and the way that the internal cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.670" end="00:00:40.070" style="s2">of social groups enable large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.550" end="00:00:41.630" style="s2">collective action so this is a book</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.070" end="00:00:44.390" style="s2">about the mathematical patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.630" end="00:00:48.230" style="s2">history kind of a complexity science of</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.390" end="00:00:50.270" style="s2">the history of civilizations and I found</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.230" end="00:00:53.180" style="s2">it to be extremely useful for me because</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.270" end="00:00:55.670" style="s2">I want to understand how different</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.180" end="00:00:58.280" style="s2">groups of people can come together form</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.670" end="00:01:01.930" style="s2">shared social identities and then start</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.280" end="00:01:05.180" style="s2">to work together in collaborative ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.930" end="00:01:08.120" style="s2">against other human groups to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.180" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">large goals and so this book looks at</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.120" end="00:01:14.270" style="s2">such factors as the way that inequality</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:16.610" style="s2">can arise within a social group and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.270" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">that inequality can lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.610" end="00:01:22.280" style="s2">breakdown of cooperation and then there</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:23.780" style="s2">could be things like noble elites can</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.280" end="00:01:25.940" style="s2">start to battle against each other while</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.780" end="00:01:27.380" style="s2">the poor are marginalized that might</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.940" end="00:01:29.900" style="s2">sound familiar to what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.380" end="00:01:32.210" style="s2">the world today so this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.900" end="00:01:34.310" style="s2">dynamic pattern where a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.210" end="00:01:37.580" style="s2">come together and form an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.310" end="00:01:40.130" style="s2">complex civilization then have internal</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.580" end="00:01:43.090" style="s2">dynamics of cohesion and coherence as</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.130" end="00:01:45.979" style="s2">well as tension and conflict and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.090" end="00:01:48.350" style="s2">patterns that arise between those</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.979" end="00:01:51.080" style="s2">different drivers are what enables</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.350" end="00:01:54.229" style="s2">civilizations to rise and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.080" end="00:01:55.820" style="s2">caused them to collapse so what Peter</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.229" end="00:01:58.189" style="s2">Turchin does in this book that I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.820" end="00:02:01.250" style="s2">is really really helpful for change</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.189" end="00:02:03.409" style="s2">strategists today is he offers a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.250" end="00:02:05.470" style="s2">framework for understanding how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.409" end="00:02:08.330" style="s2">competition between different groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.470" end="00:02:11.110" style="s2">specifically the frontier region at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.330" end="00:02:13.500" style="s2">edge of Empires where there are bands of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.110" end="00:02:16.140" style="s2">tribal groups that end up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.500" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">battles and conflict with the Empire how</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.140" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">that can create internal cohesion within</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">the Empire that enables it to remain</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">strong so we might think of this in</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">terms of a the current context looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">at things like the the rise of the Tea</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">Party in the United States and how it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">a small but very internal a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">group and as it engages an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:40.470" style="s2">battle for the kind of the territory of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">the mind for politics in the United</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.470" end="00:02:46.800" style="s2">States how the the liberal or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">progressive groups that compete with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.800" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">Tea Party ideology can actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:53.340" style="s2">a type of frontier boundary effect that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:55.770" style="s2">helps to a strengthen the internal</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.340" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">cohesion of that group so this is how</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.770" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">the Roman Empire was able to rise and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">persist for a thousand years this is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:06.480" style="s2">various empires in Eastern Europe and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:09.450" style="s2">South America were able to rise and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.480" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">remain coherent at boundaries with other</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.450" end="00:03:15.630" style="s2">human tribal communities and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">how political tribes and economic tribes</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.630" end="00:03:22.140" style="s2">today can form empires of a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:23.820" style="s2">sophistication so so what we really need</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.140" end="00:03:26.700" style="s2">to do is understand how those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.820" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">arise and this is a book it&#39;ll help you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.700" end="00:03:30.660" style="s2">understand how that works so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:33.330" style="s2">that if you want to understand the large</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.660" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">scale patterns of civilization and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.330" end="00:03:38.220" style="s2">to create group cohesion to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:42.360" style="s2">collective goals then you&#39;ll want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.220" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">read this book so that&#39;s it um we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.360" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">peace and war by Peter Turkson enjoy</p>
