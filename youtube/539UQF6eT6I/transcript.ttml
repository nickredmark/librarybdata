<p begin="00:00:02.490" end="00:00:12.110" style="s2">Last time we talked about the state of the world of faith</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.110" end="00:00:17.500" style="s2"> at the end of the nineteenth century. And I told you a little bit about Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.500" end="00:00:21.130" style="s2"> and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.130" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2"> Many of the clinical theories we are going to discuss in the next two lectures,</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:36.130" style="s2"> after this college, were influenced by philosophers, and that&#39;s why me</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.130" end="00:00:39.110" style="s2"> will discuss the philosophers with you.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.110" end="00:00:48.850" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if the great philosophers are tuned in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.850" end="00:00:57.760" style="s2"> the deeper layers of our cultural meaning systems that evolve over time.</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.760" end="00:01:03.510" style="s2"> And they can indicate how those structures work, and describe their weaknesses and strengths,</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.510" end="00:01:08.120" style="s2"> and the changes they are likely to undergo as time goes on.</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.120" end="00:01:15.350" style="s2"> Obviously, people can be behind, and it is equally likely that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.350" end="00:01:20.399" style="s2"> some people are ahead of their time. We can assume, if we think from</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.399" end="00:01:25.820" style="s2"> the &quot;Big Five&quot; model, which the people who are ahead often</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.820" end="00:01:30.979" style="s2"> are very intelligent, and very open. And that&#39;s a pretty good definition of a philosopher.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.979" end="00:01:34.270" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:34.270" end="00:01:43.210" style="s2"> Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, more than any other thinker, had their finger on the pulse</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.210" end="00:01:53.170" style="s2"> of the change of cultural meaning systems at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.170" end="00:02:01.209" style="s2"> They were both very concerned due to the fact that the systems of meanings within Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.209" end="00:02:09.709" style="s2"> formed, fragmented, for various reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.709" end="00:02:17.270" style="s2"> the most important of which was probably the emergence of the scientific worldview.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.270" end="00:02:23.970" style="s2"> And as I explained in the previous lecture, both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche believed that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.970" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2"> the modern people because of that ... I think in the early twentieth century it was the western people,</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:35.970" style="s2"> but I think now you can say it&#39;s about the modern people ... in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.970" end="00:02:41.210" style="s2"> cultural discontinuity.</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.210" end="00:02:48.530" style="s2"> Belief systems, as well as technological systems, have now changed the world so radically,</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.530" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2"> that the conflict between modernity and traditional forms of faith is very strongly experienced,</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2"> everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:06.100" style="s2"> I think that is certainly one of the forces that give rise to the struggle between</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.100" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2"> Islamic Fundamentalism and Modernity. Because that is what it is, and not so much a struggle between Islamic fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:21.050" style="s2"> and the western world. The basic problem is that people usually live</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.050" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2"> in cultural constructions that are very old and well-founded</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:34.840" style="s2"> in evolved systems of meaning, which are more profound than that which is articulated and explicit.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.840" end="00:03:42.060" style="s2"> And if there is a period of very rapid cognitive and technological change,</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.060" end="00:03:50.990" style="s2"> then the integrity of those systems starts ... it gets questionable</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.990" end="00:03:57.620" style="s2"> from an explicit perspective, but also insufficiently from a practical perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.620" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2"> An example that you can consider is the introduction of the contraceptive pill.</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:16.280" style="s2"> If you listen to politically minded people, they say that the empowerment of women,</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.280" end="00:04:21.820" style="s2"> was essentially a political issue, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very reasonable to do it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.820" end="00:04:23.729" style="s2"> in that way.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.729" end="00:04:30.490" style="s2"> Of course, everything has a feedback loop, and there are different causal routes to an outcome.</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.490" end="00:04:32.370" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:04:32.370" end="00:04:39.139" style="s2"> The important element in the emancipation of women was, of course, the development of trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.139" end="00:04:45.229" style="s2"> forms of contraception, in particular the contraceptive pill.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.229" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2"> And once you educate women, anywhere in the world, it&#39;s not just economic productivity that goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2"> up dramatically, it is in fact the best predictor of growing economic productivity</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2"> in the modernization of a state, the granting of rights to women.</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:05.999" style="s2"> Whether it is due to the granting of rights to women, or because of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.999" end="00:05:11.319" style="s2"> the presence of an underlying belief structure that allows rights very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.319" end="00:05:17.291" style="s2"> expanding is difficult to determine. But anyway, it is.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.291" end="00:05:23.020" style="s2"> In addition, women stop having children very quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.020" end="00:05:24.310" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:05:24.310" end="00:05:31.479" style="s2"> For example, I think it&#39;s Iran where this has been most illustrative,</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.479" end="00:05:37.460" style="s2"> the last two generations. From families much larger than needed for replacement to families</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.460" end="00:05:41.139" style="s2"> that are much smaller than needed for replacement, in one or two generations.</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.139" end="00:05:45.220" style="s2"> It&#39;s a very big change, and not something anyone expected.</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.220" end="00:05:53.749" style="s2"> It is part of the developments that will quickly make our population peak,</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.749" end="00:05:56.029" style="s2"> and after that it will stabilize or decrease.</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.029" end="00:06:00.419" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know how many of you know this, but the predictions are there</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.419" end="00:06:05.240" style="s2"> In thirty years to fifty years, there will be nine billion people on the earth, and that will be the culmination.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.240" end="00:06:06.319" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:10.860" style="s2"> Then it will decrease sharply, and you can see how that is happening right now,</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.860" end="00:06:14.650" style="s2"> all over the West, and it&#39;s happening a lot in China, and it&#39;s happening in Japan,</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.650" end="00:06:18.699" style="s2"> where there are more old people than young people.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.699" end="00:06:23.580" style="s2"> Because the young people don&#39;t have enough children to replace the population.</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.580" end="00:06:28.050" style="s2"> So the probability that it will peak at around nine billion, and then decline ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.050" end="00:06:32.939" style="s2"> it is not certain, but that is what the best predictions seem to indicate.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.939" end="00:06:39.870" style="s2"> What happens in times of great technological and cognitive change,</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.870" end="00:06:45.999" style="s2"> because those things go together, that is the certainties on which people base their interpretation of the world,</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.999" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2"> and more importantly, on which they base their judgment of how to act,</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:06:56.330" style="s2"> become insecure.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.330" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2"> For example, if you introduce the contraceptive pill to a population,</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:08.849" style="s2"> and making women&#39;s reproductive power voluntary, you change very radically</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.849" end="00:07:15.320" style="s2"> almost all basic social structures, especially marriage.</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.320" end="00:07:23.150" style="s2"> And marriage has traditionally been seen as the foundation of civilization.</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.150" end="00:07:28.529" style="s2"> And there are more and more people who are not married than people who are.</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.529" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2"> It&#39;s hard to interpret that because</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:41.069" style="s2"> we can&#39;t turn back time, and it&#39;s not clear if that would be desirable,</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.069" end="00:07:47.529" style="s2"> if possible. But expect cultural constructs that last for centuries, or maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.529" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2"> thousands or tens of thousands of years, can keep up with such changes,</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2"> of that size ... that is not possible.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:03.169" style="s2"> You are experiencing technological changes that are unimaginable,</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.169" end="00:08:06.169" style="s2"> almost every year, and you hardly notice it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.169" end="00:08:09.550" style="s2"> &quot;Tinder&quot; is a good example of this.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.550" end="00:08:12.550" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know if you guys know, but Tinder has produced a decent increase in STDs.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.550" end="00:08:17.379" style="s2"> It is a major technology because it is the first technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.379" end="00:08:24.210" style="s2"> that was once invented that allows men to find partners without the fear</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:30.119" style="s2"> to be rejected. That was a limiting factor ... that has been a characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.119" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2"> of the interaction between men and women since the beginning of history.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2"> These things are happening at an incredible speed, and it is not reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:48.690" style="s2"> to expect our slower cultural constructs to keep up.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.690" end="00:08:53.610" style="s2"> For example, people often talk about religion dividing people.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.610" end="00:08:54.610" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:54.610" end="00:08:59.350" style="s2"> You often hear critics of formal religion talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.350" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2"> that religion would be responsible for a tremendous amount of destruction and war and conflict.</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:09.699" style="s2"> This is not caused by religion, but by &quot;tribalism,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.699" end="00:09:14.410" style="s2"> and chimpanzees are also characterized by tribalism. And I don&#39;t think chimpanzees are at war</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:16.510" style="s2"> with each other for religious reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.510" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2"> The religious groups of humanity are manifestations on a grand scale,</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:28.920" style="s2"> of the same phenomena that produce social hierarchies in the wild. And great religions unite people</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.920" end="00:09:34.120" style="s2"> within that religion, in addition to dividing people, outside of religion.</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.120" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2"> The accumulation of religious tradition over time is a process that has taken thousands, tens of thousands,</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:46.620" style="s2"> and has even enabled millions of people to live within the same hierarchy of values.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.620" end="00:09:49.149" style="s2"> And to live relatively peacefully, as a result.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.149" end="00:09:52.470" style="s2"> I say &quot;relatively peaceful.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.470" end="00:10:00.330" style="s2"> A hundred years ago it was thought that archaic peoples,</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.330" end="00:10:04.940" style="s2"> peoples who still live quite isolated, in small tribes,</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.940" end="00:10:09.529" style="s2"> which, in fact, are still alive at the Stone Age technological level ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.529" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2"> There was a very popular idea, for a long time, that those cultures were communist,</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:19.620" style="s2"> and knew no violence. That is not true.</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.620" end="00:10:20.910" style="s2"> They were not at all free from violence.</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.910" end="00:10:25.420" style="s2"> In Stone Age cultures, the amount of murders is much greater</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.420" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2"> than in civilized cultures, the difference is significant. That has several reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:35.041" style="s2"> but I&#39;m telling you so that you let go of the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.041" end="00:10:40.750" style="s2"> complex societies and the spread of unifying religious ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.750" end="00:10:45.230" style="s2"> coincided with an increase in violence, because there is simply no evidence for that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.230" end="00:10:46.339" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:10:46.339" end="00:10:52.550" style="s2"> The problem with these large-scale belief systems is that they are not very fast,</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.550" end="00:11:01.139" style="s2"> because if a large-scale belief system wants to manifest itself,</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.139" end="00:11:08.389" style="s2"> in a reasonable form, it must be based on the mutual agreement of the people</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.389" end="00:11:14.690" style="s2"> operating within it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.690" end="00:11:21.399" style="s2"> So for Toronto to exist as a peaceful city, what needs to be done is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.399" end="00:11:27.350" style="s2"> the vast majority must agree that the rules that regulate the city and the social interactions</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.350" end="00:11:34.319" style="s2"> in the city, be useful and just. &#39;Cause if you don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.319" end="00:11:39.860" style="s2"> then all kinds of small groups will emerge, and people will be more revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.860" end="00:11:43.819" style="s2"> adopting courses of action. They will become more violent, and the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.819" end="00:11:44.819" style="s2"> starts falling apart.</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.819" end="00:11:52.040" style="s2"> It&#39;s not easy to set a collective norm because people have to agree.</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.040" end="00:11:57.209" style="s2"> You can imagine agreeing on something, even with a small agreement</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.209" end="00:12:01.820" style="s2"> that affects many people is a process that takes a very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.820" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2"> People can discuss endlessly about the smallest changes in the systems that regulate our behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:08.040" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:12:08.040" end="00:12:13.260" style="s2"> Some of you may be familiar with &quot;terror management&quot; theories.</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.260" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2"> How many of you have heard about the &quot;terror management&quot; theory?</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:21.150" style="s2"> Terror management theories are based on the idea that our belief systems are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.150" end="00:12:24.140" style="s2"> protect us from our fear of death.</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.140" end="00:12:28.570" style="s2"> How exactly they do that is not well specified by the terror management theories,</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.570" end="00:12:33.960" style="s2"> but the originator of the theory, Ernest Becker, who was a sociologist,</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.960" end="00:12:42.770" style="s2"> and a Freudian, believed that cultural systems allow us to hold beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.770" end="00:12:49.129" style="s2"> to link our actions, finite and infinite, so that we put ourselves in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.129" end="00:12:54.629" style="s2"> to immortality, and thus escape the truth of the finiteness of our existence.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.629" end="00:12:59.800" style="s2"> Which the terror management theorists don&#39;t pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.800" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2"> is the fact that belief systems are not only systems of belief, but that they are systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:07.639" style="s2"> of action regulation.</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.639" end="00:13:11.320" style="s2"> We&#39;ve talked about the Piagetian idea of ​​a game.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.320" end="00:13:17.560" style="s2"> The game first exists as something anyone can play, and only after that</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.560" end="00:13:21.550" style="s2"> as something that people represent. And the same goes for a social culture.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.550" end="00:13:22.629" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:13:22.629" end="00:13:27.149" style="s2"> A culture regulates the way you interact with each other, and what you expect from each other,</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.149" end="00:13:32.949" style="s2"> and how everyone can fulfill their needs in relation to each other,</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.949" end="00:13:38.569" style="s2"> and then it is represented. And the representation can help you find meaning in your life,</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.569" end="00:13:43.480" style="s2"> but the fact of the social contract to begin with, the phenomenon that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.480" end="00:13:48.269" style="s2"> regulates interpersonal behavior, it does not protect you from the fear of death, it protects you from dying.</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.269" end="00:13:51.940" style="s2"> And that is very important to note.</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.940" end="00:13:56.391" style="s2"> You all know it&#39;s very cold outside today</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.391" end="00:14:01.899" style="s2"> and yet you sit here in this classroom, ridiculously comfortable,</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.899" end="00:14:05.870" style="s2"> for a classroom, and certainly compared to the rest of the world.</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.870" end="00:14:11.050" style="s2"> You are not freezing to death here, and it is not your faith that protects you.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.050" end="00:14:12.050" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:14:12.050" end="00:14:16.980" style="s2"> It is the fact that you are embedded in this extraordinarily complex system of cultural interactions,</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.980" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2"> and it just so happens that you can sit here and listen to a lecture,</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:26.029" style="s2"> while thousands of people are busy, many out in the cold, causing that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.029" end="00:14:30.529" style="s2"> the electricity, for example, that keeps this place warm, is well maintained and functions,</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.529" end="00:14:33.840" style="s2"> which requires an enormous amount of work.</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.840" end="00:14:39.620" style="s2"> In times of rapid change, the social contract has difficulty adjusting itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.620" end="00:14:43.910" style="s2"> so that everyone knows how to behave in relation to each other,</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.910" end="00:14:49.120" style="s2"> but it is also very difficult to define it, the articulated standards that one</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.120" end="00:14:54.180" style="s2"> society, it is very difficult to transform it fast enough so that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.180" end="00:15:02.440" style="s2"> keep up with changes and help people decide what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.440" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2"> An example.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2"> I had a client some time ago who was raised as a fundamentalist Christian.</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:17.870" style="s2"> She was so socialized that she was convinced that premarital sex</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.870" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2"> was wrong, but the odds of her getting married before she was twenty-seven or twenty-eight,</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:26.529" style="s2"> was small, for several reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.529" end="00:15:30.519" style="s2"> So she had this problem, and it was a very interesting problem from my perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.519" end="00:15:40.439" style="s2"> Because ... I think that in a well-regulated psyche, sexuality is integrated into the personality,</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.439" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2"> so that the self has its role in the administration of the self.</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:52.199" style="s2"> It&#39;s well integrated inwardly, so it&#39;s under moral control,</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.199" end="00:15:58.360" style="s2"> because it has its own function, and it also ensures that the person remains well situated</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.360" end="00:16:03.040" style="s2"> in the present, will develop well in the future, and will maintain good relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.040" end="00:16:08.060" style="s2"> with all the people in the area. But it was pretty clear to me that a lot of the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.060" end="00:16:12.249" style="s2"> imposed on her, as a result of her relatively rigid faith,</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.249" end="00:16:16.770" style="s2"> disrupted her personal development.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.770" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2"> What we had to figure out was: which moral guidelines to use</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:28.269" style="s2"> to regulate your sexual behavior outside of marriage, when you are newly planning to be married</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.269" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2"> late twenties?</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:33.430" style="s2"> Good luck if you have to find out.</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.430" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2"> That is a very complicated question.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:43.800" style="s2"> It is not clear that any individual can solve that in a lifetime.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.800" end="00:16:48.980" style="s2"> Even if you wouldn&#39;t think of anything else, especially because of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.980" end="00:16:54.970" style="s2"> keeps changing as you try to adapt.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.970" end="00:16:59.350" style="s2"> In the end, although it was a very individual solution, we concluded that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.350" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2"> there were things that she had forbidden herself and that prevented her</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:09.400" style="s2"> to have long-term relationships. And that, that her development</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.400" end="00:17:14.199" style="s2"> as an adult person disturbed. And that was the moral she had used to guide her behavior</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.199" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2"> to structure, seemed counterproductive, at least in some areas.</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:26.819" style="s2"> You can regulate your sexuality with the hope of marriage,</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.819" end="00:17:29.740" style="s2"> if you get married when you&#39;re nineteen, twenty, or twenty-one.</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.740" end="00:17:32.779" style="s2"> But it&#39;s a lot different if that isn&#39;t going to happen until</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.779" end="00:17:34.870" style="s2"> you are in your late twenties.</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.870" end="00:17:42.169" style="s2"> Nietzsche and Dostoevsky talked a lot about the collapse of systems of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.169" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2"> at the end of the nineteenth century, and then a very fast one</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:53.020" style="s2"> period of technological change, which really started in the late eighteen hundred.</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.020" end="00:17:58.120" style="s2"> That was the height of the industrial revolution, in particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.120" end="00:18:04.380" style="s2"> in England, and many modern technologies were created</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.380" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2"> such as the car, the airplane, electric light, recording devices,</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2"> and all the things we are still building on today.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:23.030" style="s2"> And in addition to the collapse of classical Christian faith, and the introduction of all these new technologies,</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.030" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2"> World War I broke out, affecting the monarchical structure of the West</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:33.029" style="s2"> collapsed, and so did the Ottoman Empire,</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.029" end="00:18:38.200" style="s2"> which led to the creation of the modern Middle East,</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.200" end="00:18:41.100" style="s2"> and that is still hardly in order.</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.100" end="00:18:46.060" style="s2"> The monarchical structures collapsed, those ancient civilizations.</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.060" end="00:18:52.400" style="s2"> The Russians underwent their revolution and turned into communists.</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.400" end="00:19:00.620" style="s2"> And after World War I, the tension between the different ways of shaping society became,</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.620" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2"> after the fall of the monarchies, almost unbearable. And the people did not know</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:07.780" style="s2"> what to do.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.780" end="00:19:15.029" style="s2"> What happened at the end of Nietzsche&#39;s and Dostoevsky&#39;s period was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.029" end="00:19:18.910" style="s2"> the question they both ...</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.910" end="00:19:26.450" style="s2"> The main question that both had asked became the focal point</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.450" end="00:19:29.910" style="s2"> in the development of philosophical ideas about ethics in the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.910" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2"> You can see that as post-religious ethics.</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:38.660" style="s2"> I&#39;m telling you that because</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.660" end="00:19:47.030" style="s2"> much psychoanalytic or psychotherapeutic treatment revolves around ethics.</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.030" end="00:19:50.870" style="s2"> That cannot be stressed enough, because ethics is about how you see the world, and how you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.870" end="00:19:58.690" style="s2"> you behave. Even behaviorists who are theoretically anchored in the scientific world</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.690" end="00:20:05.570" style="s2"> are still practical ethicists. Because what they do structurally with their clients is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.570" end="00:20:10.409" style="s2"> analyze the problems they suffer from, subdivide them into subproblems,</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.409" end="00:20:15.230" style="s2"> and try to find solutions that will improve their quality of life. Practical, implementable</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.230" end="00:20:20.350" style="s2"> solutions that improve their quality of life, not only now, but also for the future,</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.350" end="00:20:22.710" style="s2"> and that is not a scientific matter.</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.710" end="00:20:25.270" style="s2"> That&#39;s a matter of how to live.</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.270" end="00:20:32.340" style="s2"> So the whole history of the twentieth century, politically, economically, psychologically,</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.340" end="00:20:40.370" style="s2"> was a series of attempts to answer the question, &quot;If your fundamental ethical systems fall away,</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.370" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2"> how are you supposed to live? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2"> Nietzsche made it very clear that there would be two consequences, the disappearance of these systems.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:54.309" style="s2"> The first would be nihilism, believe in nothing, whatever he saw as</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.309" end="00:20:59.960" style="s2"> a form of flight from responsibility. It is a natural consequence of the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.960" end="00:21:05.110" style="s2"> the classical belief systems, but it is also an escape. It&#39;s the kind of excuse that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.110" end="00:21:10.700" style="s2"> Dostoevsky had explored very deeply in his short brilliant novel &quot;Notes from the Underground.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.700" end="00:21:16.409" style="s2"> In which he describes a person who ends up ... an intelligent person, and an irresponsible person,</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.409" end="00:21:22.350" style="s2"> who has ended up in a black hole of meaninglessness, where he hates,</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.350" end="00:21:26.460" style="s2"> bitterness and the desire for revenge, and all the things someone experiences</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.460" end="00:21:32.390" style="s2"> would torment in the underworld, which has nothing to keep itself together.</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.390" end="00:21:36.730" style="s2"> And Nietzsche also talked about the likelihood of people turning</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.730" end="00:21:43.320" style="s2"> would turn to totalitarian belief systems, and he particularly discussed communism as a substitute</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.320" end="00:21:44.649" style="s2"> for religious belief.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.649" end="00:21:47.260" style="s2"> I can give you a Canadian example of that.</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.260" end="00:21:50.500" style="s2"> I once heard someone speak from &quot;Gallup Poll&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.500" end="00:21:51.980" style="s2"> I was at a conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.980" end="00:21:57.250" style="s2"> It&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve ever heard this, and I think it&#39;s an amazing fact.</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.250" end="00:21:58.250" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:21:58.250" end="00:22:05.130" style="s2"> They looked at the likelihood that people would be separatists in Quebec.</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.130" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2"> If you were an apostate Catholic, you were ten times more likely to be a separatist.</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:15.169" style="s2"> The reason for that ... Catholicism fell apart in Quebec</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.169" end="00:22:16.169" style="s2"> late 1950s.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.169" end="00:22:24.940" style="s2"> It was one of the last places in the West where feudal</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.940" end="00:22:29.640" style="s2"> structures of Catholicism had survived up to that point,</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.640" end="00:22:35.860" style="s2"> until the late 1950s. And that suddenly collapsed, just like faith</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.860" end="00:22:41.279" style="s2"> in Christianity in Russia in late 1880. And what happened in Quebec ...</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.279" end="00:22:43.880" style="s2"> in the first place, the birth rate fell dramatically.</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.880" end="00:22:49.380" style="s2"> I did research in Quebec, and in the 1950s and before</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.380" end="00:22:54.820" style="s2"> families with nine to thirteen children were very normal. But now Quebec has</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.820" end="00:22:56.990" style="s2"> the lowest birth rate in the West, I think.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.990" end="00:22:58.550" style="s2"> It is much lower than necessary for replacement.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.550" end="00:23:00.179" style="s2"> Everyone left the church.</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.179" end="00:23:04.490" style="s2"> Nobody gets married. And if you were a renegade Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.490" end="00:23:07.160" style="s2"> you were ten times more likely to be a separatist.</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.160" end="00:23:12.780" style="s2"> That means when Catholicism fell away, people still do</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.780" end="00:23:18.080" style="s2"> highly structured belief systems, took nationalism as an obvious alternative.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.080" end="00:23:25.380" style="s2"> That explains the rigidity and utopian ...</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.380" end="00:23:31.300" style="s2"> the utopian nature of the Quebec movement for independence.</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.300" end="00:23:37.029" style="s2"> I remember talking to a colleague, a very intelligent person,</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.029" end="00:23:42.620" style="s2"> I asked him about it because at the time they predicted that if Quebec seceded,</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.620" end="00:23:47.250" style="s2"> the Canadian dollar would fall to forty cents, forty-five US dollar cents,</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.250" end="00:23:48.250" style="s2"> something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.250" end="00:23:49.800" style="s2"> That would be an economic disaster.</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.800" end="00:23:55.539" style="s2"> I said, &quot;They predict that if Quebec separates,</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.539" end="00:23:59.429" style="s2"> and no one knows how to do that, then the Canadian economy will collapse,</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.429" end="00:24:04.070" style="s2"> and the Quebec economy is going to collapse. ”And he did not deny that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.070" end="00:24:06.429" style="s2"> He said, &quot;Yes, but it&#39;s worth it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.429" end="00:24:10.200" style="s2"> And I thought, &quot;You just can&#39;t have a conversation that way.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.200" end="00:24:15.380" style="s2"> Because from my perspective, a total, or severe economic crisis, is a good reason</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.380" end="00:24:22.750" style="s2"> to not do something. But if you believe the potential for the future is such,</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.750" end="00:24:25.280" style="s2"> that, that is justified, then there is no talking to you.</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.280" end="00:24:28.820" style="s2"> You just decided that, and that was it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.820" end="00:24:32.941" style="s2"> When I lived in Quebec, where I lived for a long time, I quickly realized</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.941" end="00:24:36.990" style="s2"> never to have a political discussion with a separatist, because that was complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.990" end="00:24:38.899" style="s2"> counterproductive.</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.899" end="00:24:44.750" style="s2"> They had fixed axioms like, &quot;The future will be so good,</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.750" end="00:24:48.100" style="s2"> that no matter what price we pay for it in the present, it&#39;ll justify that. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.100" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2"> That is not an idea.</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:55.900" style="s2"> That is an expression of faith. You saw the same thing happening ... not from the same principles,</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.900" end="00:25:00.250" style="s2"> I&#39;m not saying that, but you saw the same thing happening from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.250" end="00:25:05.930" style="s2"> in Russia, when the communists really started to get active in the 1920s,</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.930" end="00:25:11.149" style="s2"> and whatever terror was fully justified, because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.149" end="00:25:16.890" style="s2"> bring about a future condition that would be paradise.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.890" end="00:25:23.429" style="s2"> Regardless, Dostoevsky went even further in his exploration of the idea of ​​nihilism,</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.429" end="00:25:26.450" style="s2"> for Dostoevsky was someone who was willing to go to extremes in an argument.</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.450" end="00:25:33.570" style="s2"> One of the things he stated was that if there is no god, then everything is allowed.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.570" end="00:25:39.710" style="s2"> His fundamental hypothesis was that if there is no final measure of values,</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.710" end="00:25:44.970" style="s2"> no transcendent measure of values, then you are radically free.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.970" end="00:25:49.299" style="s2"> The existentialists would say you can use that radical freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.299" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2"> to find meaning in your life, but what Dostoevsky realized was that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2"> who can use radical freedom for whatever you want.</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:26:02.760" style="s2"> For example, in his book &quot;Guilt and Penance&quot;, he explores actions and beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.760" end="00:26:07.529" style="s2"> from a student named Raskolnikov. And Raskolnikov is a starving student.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.529" end="00:26:12.350" style="s2"> He&#39;s studying law, and doesn&#39;t have enough to eat, so his cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.350" end="00:26:17.220" style="s2"> somewhat affected, as it goes through stages of starvation and drunkenness.</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.220" end="00:26:19.610" style="s2"> So he doesn&#39;t think so clearly.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.610" end="00:26:24.130" style="s2"> He wants to study law to help society, and he finds out</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.130" end="00:26:30.210" style="s2"> his sister is willing to enter into a loveless marriage, and to prostitute herself,</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.210" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2"> so she has enough money to share with her mother,</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:40.450" style="s2"> and to continue to pay for his law studies. And that doesn&#39;t seem like a good deal to him.</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.450" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:46.710" style="s2"> At the same time, he owes money to a pawnbroker who hates everyone,</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.710" end="00:26:52.140" style="s2"> a miserable person in every way imaginable. That is how Dostoevsky describes the situation.</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.140" end="00:26:57.649" style="s2"> The pawnshop has a niece, if I remember correctly, who treats them like a slave and mistreats them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.649" end="00:27:02.450" style="s2"> She gets money in all kinds of ways, but never does anything with it,</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.450" end="00:27:08.649" style="s2"> she lives in poverty. And he sees her as someone without whose existence</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.649" end="00:27:10.470" style="s2"> the world would be better off.</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.470" end="00:27:17.001" style="s2"> All those things take place in his imagination, and he decides that,</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.001" end="00:27:22.590" style="s2"> because there is no ultimate measure of value, all morality is essentially cowardice.</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.590" end="00:27:25.870" style="s2"> Somewhat the opposite of what Nietzsche concluded.</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.870" end="00:27:31.340" style="s2"> He said most people are cowardly, and justify that with their morals. But Raskolnikov</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.340" end="00:27:36.140" style="s2"> had the idea, &quot;Why do I have to obey any rule?</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.140" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2"> If there is no ultimate ground for all these rules, it is just convention and cowardice.</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.850" style="s2"> And if I&#39;m strong enough, then I can step out of that box and do whatever I want. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.850" end="00:27:47.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:47.000" end="00:27:52.630" style="s2"> So he decides to kill the pawnshop, which he does, with success. And not only that,</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.630" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2"> he gets away with it too. And that&#39;s about a third of &quot;Guilt and Penance,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:28:02.730" style="s2"> and the rest of the book is about the way it falls apart,</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.730" end="00:28:08.639" style="s2"> because he has performed that act. It is truly brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.639" end="00:28:15.750" style="s2"> investigating the way a value system holds you together, even in ways you don&#39;t know,</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.750" end="00:28:21.769" style="s2"> and if you get out of there, and violate your relationship with it, in a profound way,</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.769" end="00:28:27.299" style="s2"> then it will have catastrophic psychological consequences,</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.299" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2"> that affect your entire being.</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:35.940" style="s2"> We know this is not just any theory. Because many people, especially soldiers who develop post-traumatic stress disorder,</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.940" end="00:28:40.770" style="s2"> develop post-traumatic stress disorder if they</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.770" end="00:28:46.700" style="s2"> seeing themselves do what they consider very cruel, brutal, or immoral.</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.700" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2"> They are in a situation where that course of action is very likely.</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:56.440" style="s2"> A war situation.</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:29:00.169" style="s2"> Usually it&#39;s very intense, and they don&#39;t have much time to decide.</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.169" end="00:29:06.710" style="s2"> And who knows what the specific circumstances of the event in question are, but very many people</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.710" end="00:29:13.050" style="s2"> are so devastated to see themselves doing things they would not have believed</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.050" end="00:29:17.470" style="s2"> a person would be able to do that, that they no longer recover.</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.470" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2"> That&#39;s partly because they violate the ethical structure that holds them together,</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.900" style="s2"> which includes their ideas, their plans, their perception, and their interaction</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.900" end="00:29:30.920" style="s2"> with other people.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.920" end="00:29:35.690" style="s2"> That&#39;s a unified field, in a sense. And if you damage that and it fragments</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.690" end="00:29:41.220" style="s2"> then you fragment yourself, and that&#39;s not just a psychological observation,</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.220" end="00:29:43.850" style="s2"> it is a psychophysiological observation.</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.850" end="00:29:49.320" style="s2"> You can be under so much stress, produce such high stress levels, that your brain</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.320" end="00:29:55.700" style="s2"> start to get damaged by the stress hormones. So it&#39;s not just a psychological state,</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.700" end="00:30:01.590" style="s2"> it is damage to the core of your being, in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.590" end="00:30:08.919" style="s2"> The collapse of belief systems and their destabilization was well thought out</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.919" end="00:30:13.710" style="s2"> by these thinkers at the end of the nineteenth century. Then there are the technological changes,</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.710" end="00:30:19.860" style="s2"> and the sociological and political changes at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.860" end="00:30:25.529" style="s2"> the twentieth century, leaving everyone in a state of confusion.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.529" end="00:30:26.899" style="s2"> Like in Germany in the 1920s.</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.899" end="00:30:33.049" style="s2"> The Germans had gone through a terrible period of war in the trenches,</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.049" end="00:30:34.460" style="s2"> so all the men were damaged.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.460" end="00:30:38.120" style="s2"> Some had spent months at the front, in the trenches.</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.120" end="00:30:42.750" style="s2"> Their political system had disappeared, and in its place came a little-rooted democracy.</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.750" end="00:30:46.909" style="s2"> And then their economy collapsed, and Germany went through a period of hyperinflation,</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.909" end="00:30:52.330" style="s2"> effectively dropping the value of their money to zero.</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.330" end="00:30:57.010" style="s2"> That meant if you were sixty-five and had saved your whole life to have enough money</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.010" end="00:31:02.259" style="s2"> to be able to retire, and you were a good citizen, sensible and considered, then it was already</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.259" end="00:31:08.830" style="s2"> your property suddenly disappeared. And at the same time the communist revolution took place</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.830" end="00:31:13.740" style="s2"> in Soviet Russia. And they were very concerned in Germany that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.740" end="00:31:18.909" style="s2"> the same might happen there. And the communists were always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.909" end="00:31:23.289" style="s2"> for they had the &quot;Comintern,&quot; the Communist International,</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.289" end="00:31:29.950" style="s2"> dedicated to destabilizing and producing non-communist governments</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.950" end="00:31:34.509" style="s2"> the conditions for the revolution. So it wasn&#39;t paranoia, it was a real threat.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.509" end="00:31:39.190" style="s2"> It was in this disorder that fascism and the Nazis arose.</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.190" end="00:31:44.860" style="s2"> This is not surprising, because chaos awakens the desire for order.</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.860" end="00:31:46.639" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:31:46.639" end="00:31:53.029" style="s2"> That was a possibility for people, instead of following an abstract messiah,</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.029" end="00:31:58.269" style="s2"> like the idea in classical Christianity,</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.269" end="00:32:03.710" style="s2"> they created a new messiah, namely Hitler. And that certainly didn&#39;t seem to be an improvement.</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.710" end="00:32:09.590" style="s2"> Because Hitler was a messiah of destruction and fire,</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.590" end="00:32:13.429" style="s2"> about 120 million people died in World War II, and Germany</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.429" end="00:32:18.130" style="s2"> was left ruined. Hitler killed himself in his bunker under burning Berlin,</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.130" end="00:32:22.539" style="s2"> while the Russians entered Germany, and they were not happy.</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.539" end="00:32:23.539" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:32:23.539" end="00:32:28.669" style="s2"> You didn&#39;t want to be a German while the Soviets moved towards you,</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.669" end="00:32:34.139" style="s2"> after you invaded their country, pushed them back to the middle of the Soviet Union,</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.139" end="00:32:38.259" style="s2"> and caused enormous damage and suffering.</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.259" end="00:32:46.570" style="s2"> It was a terrible situation. And the messiah figures that the Russians turned to,</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.570" end="00:32:52.620" style="s2"> Lenin and Stalin were unprecedentedly barbaric and cruel. And it&#39;s strange ...</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.620" end="00:32:58.659" style="s2"> we hardly get any education about what happened in the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.659" end="00:32:59.659" style="s2"> in the twentieth century.</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.659" end="00:33:04.070" style="s2"> We know a lot more about what happened in Germany, the Holocaust,</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.070" end="00:33:08.679" style="s2"> and it is very important for people to know that, but there were tens of millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.679" end="00:33:14.529" style="s2"> destroyed in the Soviet Union. And because they were killed by</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.529" end="00:33:21.830" style="s2"> people who, in principle, were motivated by leftist utopian ideals ...</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.830" end="00:33:27.340" style="s2"> our education seems to see that as more forgivable.</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.340" end="00:33:29.830" style="s2"> And that is certainly not the case.</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.830" end="00:33:37.389" style="s2"> So the attempt to generate secular alternatives to religious belief did not seem to work.</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.389" end="00:33:43.750" style="s2"> And the alternative of nihilism has its problems.</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.750" end="00:33:48.850" style="s2"> One of these is the type of problems that Dostoevsky talked about. And the children who</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.850" end="00:33:54.529" style="s2"> shoot up high schools and explode with rage,</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.529" end="00:33:58.289" style="s2"> these are often people who feel that their life has no meaning, that life</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.289" end="00:34:04.909" style="s2"> despicable that the suffering is too great and that they bear the burden of an unfair reality.</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.909" end="00:34:13.460" style="s2"> And they develop extremely dark and destructive ideas about revenge</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.460" end="00:34:17.730" style="s2"> and terror, sometimes for years, and then they go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.730" end="00:34:24.010" style="s2"> to do those things. And it is not that their thinking is irrational.</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.010" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2"> It&#39;s coherent.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:28.940" style="s2"> It is only based on principles you may disagree with,</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.940" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2"> like the principle, &quot;Anyone I don&#39;t like deserves death.&quot; But in the absence</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:42.079" style="s2"> of a formal way of demonstrating that such thoughts are not only immoral, but wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.079" end="00:34:45.909" style="s2"> in an absolute sense, it is very difficult to invent ways to defend ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.909" end="00:34:48.929" style="s2"> against those two extremes.</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.929" end="00:34:54.730" style="s2"> The extremes of destructive nihilism, and the extremes of ideological obsession.</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.730" end="00:35:01.930" style="s2"> Nietzsche started to work out solutions for this, and I ended up with that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.930" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2"> in the previous lecture.</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.079" style="s2"> Dostoevsky&#39;s solution was to return to Christianity, to revitalize it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.079" end="00:35:17.440" style="s2"> And that was the same strategy that Alexander Solzhenitsyn tried to work out,</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.440" end="00:35:23.391" style="s2"> and also Tolstoy, in Russia, which I will tell you more about in the next lecture.</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.391" end="00:35:24.391" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:24.391" end="00:35:26.980" style="s2"> Nietzsche&#39;s idea was that people should ... he said</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.980" end="00:35:31.849" style="s2"> in his statement about the death of God, that men should become like gods,</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.849" end="00:35:39.350" style="s2"> to be able to bear the consequences of the disintegration of the previous civilization.</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.350" end="00:35:45.829" style="s2"> He believed ... his thoughts on this point are somewhat patchy.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.829" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2"> Nietzsche was a great critic of institutionalized Christianity, and he was very good at diagnosing.</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:53.640" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:53.640" end="00:36:00.040" style="s2"> He could point out what was rotten in the core of western civilization, modern civilization,</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.040" end="00:36:05.950" style="s2"> but when it came to describing what to do about it ... he didn&#39;t live long.</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.950" end="00:36:06.950" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:06.950" end="00:36:07.950" style="s2"> He died quite young.</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.950" end="00:36:11.109" style="s2"> By the way, there is a video of Nietzsche in an institution, online.</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.109" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2"> I found it recently, in the evening.</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:17.369" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t know it was ever filmed, but there&#39;s a video out</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.369" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2"> around 1899, in which he is in an institution, where he ended up in his early forties.</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:30.630" style="s2"> He talked about the development of the &quot;Übermensch,&quot; a bit often</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.630" end="00:36:37.910" style="s2"> translated as &quot;superhuman.&quot; And his idea was that people should take the burden</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.910" end="00:36:44.440" style="s2"> of creating new systems of meaning and morality, tailor-made.</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.440" end="00:36:47.690" style="s2"> They should create new values.</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.690" end="00:36:57.420" style="s2"> Well, Jung took Nietzsche&#39;s diagnosis very seriously, and you can certainly say</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.420" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2"> that Jung was as influenced by Nietzsche as by Freud. And I would say he is in a number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:07.070" style="s2"> was more influenced by Nietzsche, because what Jung tried to do was try</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.070" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2"> discover what happened to the lost values.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:18.290" style="s2"> The Nietzschean idea is that it is possible for people to create their own values.</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.290" end="00:37:24.240" style="s2"> That&#39;s problematic, in several ways,</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.240" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2"> because it doesn&#39;t seem to be exactly ... and many existentialists</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:35.819" style="s2"> who followed Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre for example, believed in radical freedom</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.819" end="00:37:43.020" style="s2"> from people. That we are doomed to freedom, and that it is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.020" end="00:37:47.630" style="s2"> that we create our own meanings and values, because we are confronted with the void,</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.630" end="00:37:53.480" style="s2"> and life is ugly, brutal and short, to use Hobbes&#39;s terms,</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.480" end="00:38:00.210" style="s2"> and we must be able to face it, and live despite it.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.210" end="00:38:02.060" style="s2"> That solution has several problems.</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.060" end="00:38:06.099" style="s2"> The first is: if you create your value system,</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.099" end="00:38:11.130" style="s2"> if i mine, then there is no reason to assume that they are sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.130" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2"> agree, so as not to have to fight each other to the death.</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:16.040" style="s2"> That&#39;s a big deal.</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.040" end="00:38:19.820" style="s2"> Each person has their own belief system.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.820" end="00:38:26.310" style="s2"> Fine, but how ... that&#39;s a kind of structured philosophical anarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.310" end="00:38:30.730" style="s2"> That might be fine if you happen to live alone on an island,</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.730" end="00:38:35.540" style="s2"> but when you&#39;re stuck with all those other people, it&#39;s hard to sustain.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.540" end="00:38:40.859" style="s2"> And so Sartre famously said, &quot;Hell, that&#39;s the others.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.859" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2"> Because he saw the other, that which he was not,</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:51.420" style="s2"> as an oppressive force that prevented him from manifesting his destiny,</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.420" end="00:38:53.970" style="s2"> in his own way.</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.970" end="00:38:59.580" style="s2"> Others can be hell, but that doesn&#39;t mean ...</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.580" end="00:39:03.780" style="s2"> First of all, that&#39;s very one-sided, because ... of course other people are hell,</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.780" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2"> you are hell too, and nature is hell.</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:11.829" style="s2"> You can find hell in many places, but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.829" end="00:39:16.670" style="s2"> the most meaningful aspects of our lives are often our social relationships,</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.670" end="00:39:21.380" style="s2"> and you cannot blame everything on the pathological society. And we must not forget</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.380" end="00:39:25.160" style="s2"> that Sartre ...</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.160" end="00:39:31.309" style="s2"> no reasonable criticism of the communists was formulated until the late 1960s.</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.309" end="00:39:33.069" style="s2"> That was quite late.</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.069" end="00:39:38.319" style="s2"> People with some sense, George Orwell for example, already figured out the whole Soviet experiment</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.319" end="00:39:46.330" style="s2"> had become very murderous in the early 1940s. So Sartre proposed radical freedom</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.330" end="00:39:54.680" style="s2"> as the existential answer to the revelation of the absence of meaning,</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.680" end="00:39:59.579" style="s2"> but when it came down to it, he couldn&#39;t resist the temptation to identify with a totalitarian structure.</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.579" end="00:40:04.589" style="s2"> So I don&#39;t see why we should pay any attention to what he said.</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.589" end="00:40:08.800" style="s2"> There is another problem with the idea that people should create their own values,</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.800" end="00:40:14.819" style="s2"> and that is that it is not that simple. The problem seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.819" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2"> that you don&#39;t obey yourself very well.</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:19.750" style="s2"> You can say, &quot;This is my code,</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.750" end="00:40:21.160" style="s2"> that I will follow. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.160" end="00:40:23.690" style="s2"> Let&#39;s do that, to get started.</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.690" end="00:40:28.960" style="s2"> You say, &quot;I&#39;m going to study a lot, and perform well in my subjects,&quot; for example.</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.960" end="00:40:32.520" style="s2"> But you don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.520" end="00:40:36.089" style="s2"> You procrastinate, you gotta read a lot, and you know you gotta read it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.089" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2"> and you should read it for reasons that are important to you in theory,</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:43.940" style="s2"> but you can&#39;t manage to sit down and read.</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.940" end="00:40:48.770" style="s2"> Your attention wanders, you do three or four stupid things, and you feel awful</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.770" end="00:40:53.300" style="s2"> it feels like you are betraying yourself, and it may be an ongoing pattern in your life.</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.300" end="00:40:57.670" style="s2"> But you discover that you are unable to create your own values.</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.670" end="00:41:02.790" style="s2"> Somehow you can&#39;t control yourself, and get there</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.790" end="00:41:06.900" style="s2"> from the psychoanalytic ideas. Freud noted,</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.900" end="00:41:11.880" style="s2"> in the aftermath of Nietzsche, that you are not in charge of your own psyche.</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.880" end="00:41:17.930" style="s2"> There are many &quot;yous&quot; in you, and they don&#39;t all want the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.930" end="00:41:24.220" style="s2"> So the idea that you can generate meaning yourself is very ... is an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.220" end="00:41:33.430" style="s2"> developed idea, for there are many meaning-generating structures within you. And not alone</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.430" end="00:41:38.329" style="s2"> don&#39;t all point in the same direction, which is a big deal, but</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.329" end="00:41:43.309" style="s2"> they don&#39;t necessarily realize themselves in an integrated way,</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.309" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2"> over time, and they don&#39;t necessarily work together in a way that allows you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:52.060" style="s2"> you find your place among other people, and in society.</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.060" end="00:41:54.859" style="s2"> &quot;Make your own meaning.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.859" end="00:41:56.830" style="s2"> Which part of you?</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.830" end="00:41:58.800" style="s2"> You are not a unity.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.800" end="00:42:04.319" style="s2"> That is a big problem, and the other problems remain completely unsolved.</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.319" end="00:42:09.950" style="s2"> One possible answer, and this is one of the more radical existentialists,</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.950" end="00:42:14.869" style="s2"> is that society needs to be reorganized, but we already know where that will lead.</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.869" end="00:42:15.869" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:42:15.869" end="00:42:21.400" style="s2"> When people are radically reorganizing society, as far as we have seen,</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.400" end="00:42:25.740" style="s2"> this usually leads to a very murderous catastrophe.</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.740" end="00:42:31.089" style="s2"> It seems reasonable to assume that those experiments</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.089" end="00:42:33.470" style="s2"> all have been tried.</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.470" end="00:42:42.390" style="s2"> Well, Jung, like Dostoevsky, was very interested in returning to the sources of meaning,</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.390" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2"> out of which, according to him, our original religious ideas had emerged, and that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:50.730" style="s2"> his idea of ​​the collective unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.730" end="00:42:57.200" style="s2"> Some of the radical criticism of religious systems is based on</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.200" end="00:43:02.940" style="s2"> the idea that there is such a thing as conscious beliefs, that there are articulated beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.940" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2"> which you can sum up in a creed, but that is not correct.</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:10.541" style="s2"> It seems far from correct, and Nietzsche, in fact, knew that.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.541" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2"> He knew that many of our social institutions had emerged from the bottom up,</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:20.260" style="s2"> and had become articulated only after they had taken on embodied form.</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.260" end="00:43:26.020" style="s2"> A tribe learns to organize itself over thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.020" end="00:43:30.359" style="s2"> of trying, and wrestling with each other, et cetera. They enter the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.359" end="00:43:36.970" style="s2"> with an underlying biological structure, and their sociological and political interactions</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.970" end="00:43:41.380" style="s2"> are limited by all those things. And maybe they produce a description of that,</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.380" end="00:43:46.500" style="s2"> over time, a description of itself, and an articulate representation, and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.500" end="00:43:47.940" style="s2"> is the religious system.</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.940" end="00:43:54.280" style="s2"> It is not that the religious system is conceived first, as a system of metaphysical assumptions,</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.280" end="00:44:00.420" style="s2"> images, and dreams, which are then transformed into rules, which are imposed on the population, who then obey them.</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.420" end="00:44:08.119" style="s2"> And in general, when people criticized formal religion, they criticized it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.119" end="00:44:12.059" style="s2"> as if it had developed like this. That&#39;s a Marxist idea, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.059" end="00:44:16.740" style="s2"> that religion is opium for the people, and that the religious structures</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.740" end="00:44:20.599" style="s2"> designed so that a small elite could control the population.</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.599" end="00:44:28.500" style="s2"> In almost every domain there is a small elite that dominates the population.</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.500" end="00:44:30.220" style="s2"> It doesn&#39;t matter which domain you take.</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.220" end="00:44:37.580" style="s2"> So Marx is correct in that there is always an unequal distribution of power</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.580" end="00:44:45.950" style="s2"> between an elite minority and a non-elite majority. But say that, that&#39;s the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.950" end="00:44:53.180" style="s2"> all systems in which people interact with each other is incredibly ill-considered.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:44:57.640" style="s2"> Thus phenomena that are extraordinarily complex are reduced to</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.640" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2"> an aspect.</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:05.410" style="s2"> That does not help. An example.</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.410" end="00:45:13.109" style="s2"> When you sample songs on YouTube, you create a chart of how popular songs are.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.109" end="00:45:14.140" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:45:14.140" end="00:45:22.010" style="s2"> You will then find out that about ten songs ... half of all songs</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.010" end="00:45:26.599" style="s2"> played at any time will be one of ten songs.</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.599" end="00:45:30.920" style="s2"> What you also discover is that half of all the songs that are played,</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.920" end="00:45:37.260" style="s2"> be played by one, or more, of ten musicians. And that&#39;s true even if you like it</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.260" end="00:45:41.890" style="s2"> the 1930s is going to now. When you watch popular music, you keep seeing the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.890" end="00:45:47.559" style="s2"> Almost everything that almost everyone listens to is made by very few people.</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.559" end="00:45:52.300" style="s2"> There are millions of musicians, but you&#39;ve never heard of most of them, and most of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.300" end="00:45:53.960" style="s2"> you will never hear a song.</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.960" end="00:45:59.089" style="s2"> It&#39;s a small minority, and you can see this happening in every area of ​​creative production.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.089" end="00:46:00.089" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:46:00.089" end="00:46:04.750" style="s2"> A small elite is created and dominates the entire domain.</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.750" end="00:46:11.940" style="s2"> It would be ridiculous to assume the ten most popular singers</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.940" end="00:46:16.540" style="s2"> and musicians working right now were the ones who set up the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.540" end="00:46:17.930" style="s2"> to let itself blossom.</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:24.420" style="s2"> Obviously that&#39;s a silly idea, and it doesn&#39;t get a smarter idea if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.420" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2"> looks at another domain, where there is great diversity and an elite is emerging.</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:32.050" style="s2"> That is a very common phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.050" end="00:46:36.119" style="s2"> It happens wherever there is creative production,</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.119" end="00:46:39.770" style="s2"> and that&#39;s why 1 percent of people have about 50 percent of the money.</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.770" end="00:46:43.470" style="s2"> This is no different in other creative domains.</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.470" end="00:46:48.520" style="s2"> We&#39;ll talk about why that happens later, but think it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.520" end="00:46:54.270" style="s2"> because those people have set up the system in such a way to benefit themselves ... that element is also there,</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.270" end="00:47:00.030" style="s2"> of course. Because once you are rich, you will prefer political policy</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.030" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2"> that keeps you rich. But that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve set up the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:09.880" style="s2"> that made you rich, in the beginning. In addition, they are not the same people, over time.</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.880" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:14.950" style="s2"> 1 percent of the people has the majority of the money ... it&#39;s always 1 percent,</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.950" end="00:47:17.720" style="s2"> but they are not the same people.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.720" end="00:47:22.359" style="s2"> Individuals usually only have money for a very short time, and big companies</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.359" end="00:47:24.290" style="s2"> do not stay upright for long.</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.290" end="00:47:29.170" style="s2"> They last an average of thirty, thirty-five, forty years, and that was it. Then they disappear.</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.170" end="00:47:33.980" style="s2"> Because the economic landscape is constantly changing.</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.980" end="00:47:39.670" style="s2"> It&#39;s very difficult for a company to ... there aren&#39;t that many steam truck companies anymore,</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.670" end="00:47:46.380" style="s2"> and no one makes blimps, and no one makes typewriters.</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.380" end="00:47:50.040" style="s2"> Things are moving fast, and that at some point you dominated the domain,</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.040" end="00:47:55.089" style="s2"> does not mean that you will be able to do this the next moment.</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.089" end="00:47:59.859" style="s2"> Well, creating meaning yourself is complicated. And then there is another problem</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.859" end="00:48:04.299" style="s2"> namely: why do you think you have enough time?</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.299" end="00:48:09.890" style="s2"> Often people come to me with relationship problems,</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.890" end="00:48:16.140" style="s2"> and part of the problem is that they shaped their relationship beyond social norms. They do,</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.140" end="00:48:20.380" style="s2"> and then they say to me, &quot;We&#39;re not getting married,</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.380" end="00:48:24.839" style="s2"> because getting married is just a piece of paper. &quot;Which is really silly,</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.839" end="00:48:30.010" style="s2"> unbelievably silly. But behind that lies the idea that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.010" end="00:48:34.270" style="s2"> wanting to be free from social constraints so that they can shape their relationship in their own way, if you take them</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.270" end="00:48:38.319" style="s2"> want to appreciate the desire for freedom, instead of escaping responsibility.</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.319" end="00:48:41.750" style="s2"> But the problem with that is ... okay, good luck.</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.750" end="00:48:43.320" style="s2"> Try it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.320" end="00:48:48.280" style="s2"> I don&#39;t know why you assume you have enough time in your thirties or forties</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.280" end="00:48:53.270" style="s2"> that you engage in relationships to discover how it should function.</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.270" end="00:48:58.140" style="s2"> You don&#39;t stand a chance. And what makes it worse is that very few people</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.140" end="00:49:03.470" style="s2"> know how to negotiate. Because it works like this.</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.470" end="00:49:08.520" style="s2"> You either conform to the social order or you stand outside it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.520" end="00:49:13.309" style="s2"> If you are out of it, you are in a chaotic place, because there are no guidelines.</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.309" end="00:49:19.300" style="s2"> And then you live chaotically because there are no guidelines, or you start formulating order.</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.300" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2"> But to do that, you need to know what you want and how to express it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:31.579" style="s2"> And then you have to find out what your partner wants and help him express it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.579" end="00:49:34.740" style="s2"> And then you have to negotiate a solution.</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.740" end="00:49:39.670" style="s2"> I would say one in twenty people knows how to negotiate.</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.670" end="00:49:41.050" style="s2"> It is very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.050" end="00:49:43.230" style="s2"> Consider the steps.</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.230" end="00:49:46.590" style="s2"> First, you have to know what you want, and then you have to admit it to yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.590" end="00:49:52.160" style="s2"> You probably won&#39;t even be able to do that first.</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.160" end="00:49:53.250" style="s2"> What do you want?</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.250" end="00:49:56.589" style="s2"> Much of what you want cannot be articulated.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.589" end="00:49:58.990" style="s2"> I will give you an example.</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.990" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2"> Some interesting research has been done some time ago into predicting the permanence of relationships.</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.660" end="00:50:10.320" style="s2"> This was the question:</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.320" end="00:50:16.730" style="s2"> &quot;How many negative interactions do you have to have, in relation to positive ...&quot; Sorry.</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.730" end="00:50:20.990" style="s2"> &quot;How many positive interactions per negative interaction should you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.990" end="00:50:25.020" style="s2"> with your partner, for a stable relationship? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.020" end="00:50:30.580" style="s2"> Well, suppose you have one negative interaction per positive interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.580" end="00:50:34.990" style="s2"> Or maybe you have ten negative per positive, and you can imagine a different situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.990" end="00:50:39.309" style="s2"> where you have a hundred positives for each negative, the whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.309" end="00:50:44.549" style="s2"> encompassing potential continuum. And you use that to predict relational satisfaction and permanence.</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.549" end="00:50:50.490" style="s2"> And you may think, &quot;One hundred is positive for every negative</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.490" end="00:50:55.780" style="s2"> the desirable ratio. Those people have a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.780" end="00:50:58.780" style="s2"> incessant compliments and happiness.</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.780" end="00:50:59.780" style="s2"> Those are the ones that stick together. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.780" end="00:51:01.819" style="s2"> But that&#39;s not true.</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.819" end="00:51:08.799" style="s2"> You can see that there is a domain with an optimal ratio.</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.799" end="00:51:14.549" style="s2"> If it is less than five positives per negative, then your relationship is falling apart.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.549" end="00:51:19.320" style="s2"> That is too negative, because people feel negative emotions more than</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.320" end="00:51:25.410" style="s2"> positive emotions, you may feel more pain than satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.410" end="00:51:30.820" style="s2"> One in five is too punitive, and people will not stay. But if you are upstairs</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.820" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2"> the eleven comes to one, it is not punitive enough. You think, &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:38.200" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:51:38.200" end="00:51:40.170" style="s2"> What do you want in a relationship?</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.170" end="00:51:41.880" style="s2"> You think, &quot;Happiness.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.880" end="00:51:44.750" style="s2"> That&#39;s not what you want, it turns out.</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.750" end="00:51:47.740" style="s2"> You want someone you can measure with.</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.740" end="00:51:49.250" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want a doormat.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.250" end="00:51:55.011" style="s2"> You don&#39;t want everything to be easy, and this is true</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.011" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2"> Kierkegaard talked about it when he talked about his decision</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:01.660" style="s2"> make things harder for people because they need it.</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.660" end="00:52:06.050" style="s2"> You know that too cause you&#39;re dating someone and he adores you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.050" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2"> and takes everything from you, and gives nothing but positive reactions,</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2"> then you immediately lose your respect for him, and you start looking for someone</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:19.490" style="s2"> which is more interesting. I think that will come</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.490" end="00:52:25.060" style="s2"> because you want your partner to challenge you. So that you are not only reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.060" end="00:52:30.619" style="s2"> get along, on a daily basis, that you can live together in the same space</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.619" end="00:52:35.230" style="s2"> in a fairly calm way. But you also want there to be enough tension in the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.230" end="00:52:39.480" style="s2"> so that you are both part of a process of mutual transformation.</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.480" end="00:52:43.640" style="s2"> Try specifying that in an articulated way.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.640" end="00:52:44.839" style="s2"> Good luck.</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.839" end="00:52:49.060" style="s2"> That also explains people&#39;s strange tendencies, such as the fact that they stay</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.060" end="00:52:53.540" style="s2"> in rather negative relationships. &quot;What the hell are you doing there?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.540" end="00:52:57.559" style="s2"> If you had put it two years ago, you would have said, &quot;I want someone by which</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.559" end="00:53:01.849" style="s2"> I feel miserable half the time. &quot;Of course you&#39;ll never say that,</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.849" end="00:53:04.980" style="s2"> but it may well be that you are looking for that.</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.980" end="00:53:16.369" style="s2"> Well, Heidegger was another philosopher who faced the problems</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.369" end="00:53:20.650" style="s2"> attempted to resolve, which Nietzsche and Dostoevsky had set out. And the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.650" end="00:53:30.150" style="s2"> Heidegger tried to solve them was by looking at philosophy in a radically new way.</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.150" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2"> He was one of the most important phenomenologists, and I told you a while ago that the phenomenologists</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:45.420" style="s2"> decided to reconstruct Western philosophy so that it would focus on being, rather than knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.420" end="00:53:50.359" style="s2"> The hardest thing to understand with the phenomenologists is some</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.359" end="00:53:54.270" style="s2"> they meant exactly by &quot;be.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.270" end="00:53:56.630" style="s2"> I&#39;ll give you a sketch.</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.630" end="00:54:00.329" style="s2"> That&#39;s where the term &quot;Dasein&quot; comes from, which is a German word, and it means</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.329" end="00:54:01.329" style="s2"> &quot;there are.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.329" end="00:54:06.970" style="s2"> Right now you are in Dasein, and Dasein is the totality of your experience.</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.970" end="00:54:14.820" style="s2"> And that&#39;s an experience of the vast world, the natural world,</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.820" end="00:54:21.670" style="s2"> and then the social world, and within it the world of your subjective experience,</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.670" end="00:54:27.930" style="s2"> and that constitutes being. And the phenomenologists argue that ...</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.930" end="00:54:32.670" style="s2"> they don&#39;t participate in the &quot;subject / object game,&quot; they are beyond the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.670" end="00:54:35.770" style="s2"> subject and object, which is part of the scientific worldview.</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.770" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2"> So it&#39;s a real paradigm shift because you follow the rules of the old perspective</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:43.910" style="s2"> cannot use within the new perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.910" end="00:54:46.530" style="s2"> You have to start with new assumptions.</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.530" end="00:54:52.140" style="s2"> One of the things you will do when you start looking phenomenologically,</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.140" end="00:54:56.500" style="s2"> is to assume that everything you experience is real.</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.500" end="00:55:03.670" style="s2"> In a phenomenological world there is no attempt to reduce pain</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.670" end="00:55:05.260" style="s2"> to something material.</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.260" end="00:55:09.150" style="s2"> Pain is a phenomenon in itself.</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.150" end="00:55:10.690" style="s2"> That also applies to tension.</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.690" end="00:55:12.000" style="s2"> And also for joy.</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.000" end="00:55:19.530" style="s2"> All things that scientists of consciousness call &quot;qualia,&quot; which they see as qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.530" end="00:55:23.049" style="s2"> the objective world, are not so viewed by the phenomenologists.</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.049" end="00:55:27.250" style="s2"> They call that primary elements of being.</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.250" end="00:55:31.140" style="s2"> It&#39;s a very interesting way of seeing things because it makes it possible</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.140" end="00:55:34.420" style="s2"> reacquire the validity of your own experience.</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.420" end="00:55:37.510" style="s2"> You can no longer say, &quot;That&#39;s just subjective.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.510" end="00:55:45.039" style="s2"> That does not mean that everything you claim subjectively is true, objective or</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.039" end="00:55:46.059" style="s2"> for others people.</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.059" end="00:55:51.720" style="s2"> It does mean that everything you experience subjectively is real.</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.720" end="00:55:55.880" style="s2"> That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t think about it, or analyze it, or categorize it,</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.880" end="00:56:03.299" style="s2"> you still have to do that, but you are in one place</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.299" end="00:56:08.089" style="s2"> where you don&#39;t have to deny or subordinate the reality of your own experience to anything.</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.089" end="00:56:09.089" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:09.089" end="00:56:16.300" style="s2"> For example, when I do dream analysis with someone, which I often do when people dream,</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.300" end="00:56:23.380" style="s2"> for dreams, as Jung noted, are manifestations of being.</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.380" end="00:56:24.780" style="s2"> You don&#39;t make them up.</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.780" end="00:56:25.980" style="s2"> They appear to you.</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.980" end="00:56:28.930" style="s2"> They appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.930" end="00:56:30.849" style="s2"> They manifest.</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.849" end="00:56:36.789" style="s2"> They do that in a strange way, I think because they contain unarticulated thoughts.</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.789" end="00:56:43.150" style="s2"> But if you can get a grip on them and judge them, they can sometimes tell you things</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.150" end="00:56:46.770" style="s2"> that you could not have discovered in any other way. And what&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.770" end="00:56:57.140" style="s2"> is that they have the same impersonal as phenomena in the greater world of experience.</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.140" end="00:56:58.700" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:58.700" end="00:57:01.460" style="s2"> You never think about the truth of a chair.</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.460" end="00:57:04.430" style="s2"> He&#39;s just there, and dreams are like that.</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.430" end="00:57:09.829" style="s2"> They&#39;re just there, and if you can decipher what they indicate,</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.829" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2"> you can get a perspective on your own experience that is not influenced by your local subjective</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:22.839" style="s2"> wishes and desires.</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.839" end="00:57:28.180" style="s2"> I hate to use the word &quot;subjective&quot; in this context.</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.180" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2"> So phenomenology is the search for being.</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:37.099" style="s2"> In being, there are several aspects, and one aspect ...</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.099" end="00:57:42.190" style="s2"> I can never remember those names, but I have it here.</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.190" end="00:57:43.190" style="s2"> Oh yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.190" end="00:57:47.380" style="s2"> Heidegger divided the world of experience into three categories.</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.380" end="00:57:54.130" style="s2"> There is the &quot;Umwelt,&quot; which I believe is the world, which extends beyond culture and the individual.</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.130" end="00:57:59.180" style="s2"> There&#39;s the &quot;Mitwelt,&quot; and that&#39;s the world we share with everyone,</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.180" end="00:58:03.819" style="s2"> the social world and social structures. And then there is the &quot;Eigenwelt,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.819" end="00:58:08.460" style="s2"> the domain of experience that is only yours, that other people cannot participate in.</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.460" end="00:58:15.299" style="s2"> Those are the elements of being, as far as the phenomenologists are concerned.</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.299" end="00:58:21.099" style="s2"> And in those domains of being, different experiences manifest themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.099" end="00:58:30.280" style="s2"> We have discussed a number of them that are manifestations of the Eigenwelt.</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.280" end="00:58:33.660" style="s2"> Scientists would call those things emotional or motivated states.</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.660" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2"> Usually people think of them as feelings.</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2"> I would say, &quot;I feel like this.</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:45.329" style="s2"> I feel this or that. ”And those are experiences that manifest, or that you have,</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.329" end="00:58:51.970" style="s2"> depending on how you see it, which indicate how you should act</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.970" end="00:58:54.920" style="s2"> in relation to being.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.920" end="00:59:01.349" style="s2"> This is relevant for psychotherapy in particular,</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.349" end="00:59:08.600" style="s2"> because the phenomenologists were very interested in the manifestation of meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.600" end="00:59:16.450" style="s2"> You could say that nihilism is the absence of meaning and totalitarianism is the locking of meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.450" end="00:59:21.650" style="s2"> If you are totalitarian, you say, &quot;All meanings are there</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.650" end="00:59:23.539" style="s2"> in relation to this structure. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.539" end="00:59:29.630" style="s2"> It&#39;s like ... the phenomenologists would say you try the Umwelt,</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.630" end="00:59:35.720" style="s2"> the natural world, the Mitwelt, the social world, and the Eigenwelt,</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.720" end="00:59:40.650" style="s2"> your personal world, you try to reduce all of that to the Mitwelt. So that everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.650" end="00:59:47.000" style="s2"> fits within a statement given to you by a higher authority.</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.000" end="00:59:50.210" style="s2"> And the nihilists, of course, don&#39;t want any of that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.210" end="00:59:58.690" style="s2"> They use their Eigenwelt, their personal world, for meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.690" end="01:00:00.910" style="s2"> declare any domain invalid.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.910" end="01:00:07.619" style="s2"> The phenomenologists would say it is a mistake to use your rationality</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.619" end="01:00:12.640" style="s2"> to undermine the manifestation of meaning. I can give you an example of that.</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.640" end="01:00:17.869" style="s2"> Imagine that you are a good nihilist, and you are considering doing something difficult,</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.869" end="01:00:23.579" style="s2"> like studying. And then you think when you&#39;re a little bit down</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.579" end="01:00:28.700" style="s2"> maybe you run into an obstacle and you think, &quot;I&#39;m going to quit.</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.700" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:32.180" style="s2"> What does it matter?</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.180" end="01:00:34.560" style="s2"> What does it matter if I get my diploma?</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.560" end="01:00:38.420" style="s2"> This knowledge is not very relevant or meaningful, and who will notice the difference</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.420" end="01:00:40.230" style="s2"> in a million years? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.230" end="01:00:47.380" style="s2"> You think, &quot;That&#39;s a perfectly rational criticism, because who will</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.380" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2"> still know in a million years? &quot;Even if you can argue that someone might know,</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.530" style="s2"> there might be effects of yours remaining in a million years, we multiply that by</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.530" end="01:00:59.309" style="s2"> a hundred thousand, so we have a trillion years.</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.309" end="01:01:03.970" style="s2"> There you are, a tiny speck of dust on a slightly larger speck, in a galaxy</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.970" end="01:01:09.190" style="s2"> with who knows how many billions of stars. And there are billions</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.190" end="01:01:13.140" style="s2"> galaxies, and more, sprawled across this one</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.140" end="01:01:19.150" style="s2"> tremendous expanding time. And in the midst of all that, who cares what you do?</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.150" end="01:01:28.170" style="s2"> A phenomenologist would say, &quot;Let&#39;s see how meaning manifests</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.170" end="01:01:37.980" style="s2"> if you change your personal world in different ways. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.980" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2"> Imagine you are trying to do something, maybe you work</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:46.720" style="s2"> as a volunteer in a hospital with sick children.</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:52.340" style="s2"> You read them aloud so that they are distracted from their pain. And you say, &quot;In a billion years,</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.340" end="01:01:56.100" style="s2"> then who will notice the difference? It&#39;s pointless to do this. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.100" end="01:02:01.430" style="s2"> The phenomenologists would say, &quot;If the framework you use,</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.430" end="01:02:09.240" style="s2"> if you change the way being manifests</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.240" end="01:02:16.349" style="s2"> making it meaningless and absurd, then you have to try to experience it in a different way. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.349" end="01:02:17.349" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:02:17.349" end="01:02:22.431" style="s2"> Because a rationalist ... the phenomenologists would say</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.431" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2"> that a rationalist cannot defend himself against the argument, &quot;What does it matter in a trillion years?</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:30.880" style="s2"> There you are, a tiny speck of dust, among other specks.</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.880" end="01:02:40.099" style="s2"> Ultimately it is meaningless. ”A phenomenologist would say,“ Expand the meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.099" end="01:02:41.339" style="s2"> That&#39;s the mark of the truth. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.339" end="01:02:45.030" style="s2"> That&#39;s a completely different way of thinking.</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.030" end="01:02:50.200" style="s2"> For example, he would say that if you go to a hospital to read to sick children,</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.200" end="01:02:55.220" style="s2"> then the framework you use should be the way you</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.220" end="01:03:02.020" style="s2"> the experience allows itself to be manifested, such that the experience manifests itself</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.020" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2"> as meaningful as possible, rather than as meaningless as possible.</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:17.240" style="s2"> That you are able to twist your own experience, causing certain elements</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.240" end="01:03:22.900" style="s2"> of your existence becoming meaningless does not mean that that is correct.</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.900" end="01:03:28.049" style="s2"> The fact that it becomes meaningless indicates that it is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.049" end="01:03:34.760" style="s2"> It depends entirely on what you assume to be primary, that&#39;s the point of the phenomenologists.</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.760" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:40.890" style="s2"> If you take your strict rationality as primary, then if it can attack anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.890" end="01:03:45.580" style="s2"> and destroy, then that object deserves to be attacked and destroyed.</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.580" end="01:03:52.030" style="s2"> But if you turn it around and say, &quot;What you have to do is deal with</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.030" end="01:03:57.540" style="s2"> allow your experience, or your experience to manifest, in a way that allows you</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.540" end="01:04:05.099" style="s2"> most meaningfully in the here and now. The framework you use to do that, and it works,</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.099" end="01:04:06.450" style="s2"> that&#39;s right.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.450" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2"> That&#39;s a completely different way of viewing it. And it is one</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:18.099" style="s2"> real way out of the pathology of rationalism. Because it is not obvious why</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.099" end="01:04:20.569" style="s2"> what you think should be primary.</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.569" end="01:04:23.430" style="s2"> The phenomenologists would go even further.</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.430" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2"> They would say ... you can see it this way ...</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:42.320" style="s2"> Binswanger said, &quot;What we perceive primarily and above all ...&quot; Binswanger was</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.320" end="01:04:46.339" style="s2"> a psychiatrist who was very influenced by ... Binswanger and Boss, the people about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.340" end="01:04:49.859" style="s2"> we will most often speak were greatly influenced by Heideggerian ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.860" end="01:04:55.890" style="s2"> They say: &quot;What we perceive primarily and above all, are not impressions of taste, sound, smell,</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.890" end="01:05:00.480" style="s2"> or touch, not even things or objects, but meanings. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.490" end="01:05:06.109" style="s2"> The idea of ​​the phenomenologists is that being consists of meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.109" end="01:05:10.760" style="s2"> It is not an objective world made up of things, but being made up of meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.760" end="01:05:11.760" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:11.760" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2"> Some meanings can be positive, and some negative,</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:19.980" style="s2"> and some neutral, but the fundamental elements of being,</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.980" end="01:05:25.770" style="s2"> the fundamental element of being is meaning. Then there is a discussion between Binswanger and Boss,</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.770" end="01:05:28.500" style="s2"> about how that meaning manifests itself.</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.500" end="01:05:32.710" style="s2"> Binswanger would say, &quot;You give meaning to the world.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.710" end="01:05:37.170" style="s2"> That is a kind of Nietzschean idea that you create your own values.</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.170" end="01:05:42.060" style="s2"> You have an inner, a priori, ontological structure,</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.060" end="01:05:46.920" style="s2"> which designs the world, a matrix of meaning, which determines how the world appears to you.</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.920" end="01:05:47.920" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:05:47.920" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2"> The easiest way to see that is ... you end up in a certain time and situation ...</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:57.550" style="s2"> that&#39;s another existentialist idea. That&#39;s part of the absurdity of your life.</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.550" end="01:06:02.060" style="s2"> You are here and now, in this specific context and situation.</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.060" end="01:06:05.369" style="s2"> You have to deal with that, and that applies to everyone.</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.369" end="01:06:10.119" style="s2"> There are arbitrary circumstances in everyone&#39;s existence, and one of those arbitrary circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.119" end="01:06:15.470" style="s2"> is the structure with which you view the world. And that structure leaves</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.470" end="01:06:21.250" style="s2"> lighting up certain things, and omitting other things. So the way meaning manifests</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.250" end="01:06:27.730" style="s2"> is a reflection of this a priori ontological structure, an a priori mode of being.</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.730" end="01:06:33.740" style="s2"> There is no being possible, that is your experience,</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.740" end="01:06:41.011" style="s2"> without the structure that consists of ... of which you consist, and which is given.</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.011" end="01:06:45.349" style="s2"> It is the activity of that structure that determines the meaning of things.</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.349" end="01:06:48.490" style="s2"> Boss would say the opposite.</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.490" end="01:06:52.589" style="s2"> He would say, &quot;Don&#39;t look like that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.589" end="01:06:59.250" style="s2"> You have to look at your existence in its entirety, which consists of the natural world,</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.250" end="01:07:03.619" style="s2"> the cultural world, and your own world, and you have to notice that meaning appears in different places,</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.619" end="01:07:05.900" style="s2"> by itself. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.900" end="01:07:12.990" style="s2"> You cannot reduce that to the effectiveness of an ontological a priori structure.</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.990" end="01:07:18.630" style="s2"> For example, what about the meaning of things you don&#39;t understand?</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.630" end="01:07:19.620" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:07:19.620" end="01:07:25.140" style="s2"> It is difficult to understand how to attribute the meaning of things that you do not understand</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.150" end="01:07:27.140" style="s2"> what you do understand.</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.140" end="01:07:29.609" style="s2"> The meaning just seems to be there.</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.609" end="01:07:31.960" style="s2"> An example.</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.960" end="01:07:36.859" style="s2"> You are in a relationship with someone and you discover that he is having an affair.</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.859" end="01:07:41.250" style="s2"> Discovering that relationship will mean a lot to you.</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.250" end="01:07:43.069" style="s2"> But you don&#39;t know what the meaning is.</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.069" end="01:07:47.799" style="s2"> You will likely interpret it very negatively to begin with, unless part of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.799" end="01:07:52.420" style="s2"> want to get away from yourself from the relationship. Because sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.420" end="01:07:56.410" style="s2"> are you happy when you are cheated on because it has had its day.</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.410" end="01:08:00.920" style="s2"> Anyway you may run into things you don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.920" end="01:08:03.080" style="s2"> that are meaningful as such.</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.080" end="01:08:11.240" style="s2"> I think you cannot separate your structure from the structure of everything.</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.240" end="01:08:16.260" style="s2"> There is always an interaction, and meaning arises from that dynamic.</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.260" end="01:08:19.150" style="s2"> Well, another way to see it.</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.150" end="01:08:21.160" style="s2"> You read a book.</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.160" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2"> The book has meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:24.160" style="s2"> Where is the meaning?</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.160" end="01:08:26.680" style="s2"> In your head?</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.680" end="01:08:28.490" style="s2"> In the book?</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.490" end="01:08:33.990" style="s2"> That is difficult to make up, because there is obviously a subjective element.</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.990" end="01:08:34.990" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:34.990" end="01:08:40.720" style="s2"> There is one aspect that is unique to you, but that meaning would not manifest</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.720" end="01:08:45.340" style="s2"> without the book. And the book wouldn&#39;t be meaningful if you and the book</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.340" end="01:08:49.930" style="s2"> were not embedded in this complex structure. So the meaning is an emergent property,</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.930" end="01:08:55.950" style="s2"> an emergent property of the dynamics of all elements of being.</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.950" end="01:08:57.850" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:08:57.850" end="01:09:01.120" style="s2"> That&#39;s an interesting way of seeing it. There are all these elements of being,</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.120" end="01:09:05.470" style="s2"> and their dance produces meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.470" end="01:09:10.530" style="s2"> A phenomenologist would say that some meanings are life-affirming,</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.530" end="01:09:15.630" style="s2"> and some life-destroying. And the phenomenologist would say,</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.630" end="01:09:23.080" style="s2"> from a clinical perspective, that if you live in a system</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.080" end="01:09:27.950" style="s2"> in which life-destroying meanings manifest themselves, you have to turn your attention away from them,</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.950" end="01:09:34.330" style="s2"> and you have to turn to meanings that are life-affirming. Which is quite interesting</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.330" end="01:09:38.350" style="s2"> the phenomenological perspective is that you can experiment with it quite easily.</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.350" end="01:09:39.350" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:09:39.350" end="01:09:44.110" style="s2"> A few phenomenological experiments, for example:</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.110" end="01:09:51.950" style="s2"> For the next two weeks, you should detach yourself from yourself so that you are observant</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.950" end="01:09:53.430" style="s2"> be an observer of your existence.</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.430" end="01:10:00.020" style="s2"> You&#39;re not so much trying to control it, you&#39;re trying to let it run its course.</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.020" end="01:10:07.340" style="s2"> And what you pay attention to is when the meaning that manifests,</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.340" end="01:10:15.610" style="s2"> as things go on is clearly life-affirming meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.610" end="01:10:19.620" style="s2"> You will see ... it depends on how well you are situated,</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.620" end="01:10:27.350" style="s2"> because if you are surrounded by ... if your field of experience mainly</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.350" end="01:10:31.750" style="s2"> negative, they will be relatively rare events, but they will be there nonetheless.</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.750" end="01:10:36.200" style="s2"> That can be just seconds or minutes a day, or every other day,</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.200" end="01:10:41.110" style="s2"> but you suddenly find yourself in a situation where things are</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.110" end="01:10:42.830" style="s2"> as you would like it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.830" end="01:10:47.430" style="s2"> You are in a situation where being is manifest as acceptable.</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.430" end="01:10:51.750" style="s2"> That is a situation in which nihilism is not adequate.</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.750" end="01:10:56.630" style="s2"> It does not apply because the quality of the experience is such that it is life-affirming.</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.630" end="01:10:58.120" style="s2"> You should notice that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.120" end="01:11:03.260" style="s2"> It happens, and then you can ask the question, &quot;What are the conditions,</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.260" end="01:11:09.970" style="s2"> which allowed all different</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.970" end="01:11:16.330" style="s2"> sub-elements of being worked together harmoniously, at that moment, in that situation,</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.330" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2"> what made that meaning appear? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:24.370" style="s2"> The next question would be, &quot;How can I make sure that</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.370" end="01:11:26.450" style="s2"> occurs more often? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.450" end="01:11:32.200" style="s2"> So you can steer yourself towards life-affirming meanings and away from</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.200" end="01:11:36.890" style="s2"> meanings related to despair and nihilism. You do ...</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.890" end="01:11:38.890" style="s2"> as if you were navigating a boat.</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.890" end="01:11:40.260" style="s2"> You actually do, I think.</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.260" end="01:11:45.230" style="s2"> I think you are navigating to find the boundary between order and chaos because there</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.230" end="01:11:46.220" style="s2"> is meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.220" end="01:11:50.060" style="s2"> Right there is meaning, and you can feel it, it is a kind of place.</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.070" end="01:11:53.400" style="s2"> That is the other thing the phenomenologists are trying to make clear.</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.410" end="01:11:55.570" style="s2"> These things are real.</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.570" end="01:11:58.890" style="s2"> They are not secondary manifestations of an underlying reality.</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.890" end="01:12:00.840" style="s2"> They are reality.</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.840" end="01:12:04.850" style="s2"> I also think we&#39;ll talk about this when we get to the neuropsychological part</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.850" end="01:12:10.100" style="s2"> come from the college that our brains are in fact primarily set up to detect meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.100" end="01:12:11.100" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:11.100" end="01:12:18.310" style="s2"> You detect meaning before you detect an object, because you have to detect meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.310" end="01:12:23.070" style="s2"> to know what to do if something happens very quickly. There are moments</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.070" end="01:12:26.870" style="s2"> to which you need to be able to respond, without having enough time to see,</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.870" end="01:12:27.870" style="s2"> what is there.</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.870" end="01:12:32.010" style="s2"> You just don&#39;t have time for it. The question is:</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.010" end="01:12:34.310" style="s2"> what exactly do you mean by meaning?</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.310" end="01:12:39.490" style="s2"> I think meaning is relevance to behavior, or relevance to the structure that defines behavior,</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.490" end="01:12:44.510" style="s2"> but those are very basic observations.</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.510" end="01:12:47.520" style="s2"> It is not that you see the object and then format the meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.520" end="01:12:50.240" style="s2"> It&#39;s the other way around, in many cases.</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.240" end="01:12:55.510" style="s2"> You perceive the meaning and abstract the object. And there is enough neurophysiological evidence for that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.510" end="01:12:56.510" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:12:56.510" end="01:13:03.300" style="s2"> For example, your retina is a pattern detector, and the information</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.300" end="01:13:08.280" style="s2"> from your retina is passed to your brain through the facial nerve, but the facial nerve branches</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.280" end="01:13:10.700" style="s2"> and goes to all kinds of places in your body.</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.700" end="01:13:15.620" style="s2"> Some of it is mapped onto your spinal cord so your eyes can move your body.</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.620" end="01:13:20.180" style="s2"> Some of it is mapped onto your amygdala so that you perceive the meaning of facial expressions,</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.180" end="01:13:22.310" style="s2"> without even seeing the face.</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.310" end="01:13:26.990" style="s2"> There are people with &quot;blind vision,&quot; with a damaged visual cortex, who see you</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.990" end="01:13:33.270" style="s2"> can show angry faces that they cannot see, but they respond electrophysiologically to them</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.270" end="01:13:38.390" style="s2"> as if they were confronted with something negative. Because the pattern on the retina</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.390" end="01:13:43.160" style="s2"> manifests itself directly on a system that maps some form of meaning.</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.160" end="01:13:48.690" style="s2"> So you can perceive meaning without perceiving an object. The idea that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.690" end="01:13:52.730" style="s2"> derives the meaning from the object ... that you see the thing, and give meaning to it,</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.730" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2"> is correct on some levels of analysis, but incorrect on many other levels of analysis.</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:07.120" style="s2"> Something else to try that is phenomenologically inspired ...</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.120" end="01:14:09.200" style="s2"> This is a pretty interesting trick.</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.200" end="01:14:12.940" style="s2"> This can be difficult for you, so be careful when trying this.</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.940" end="01:14:17.080" style="s2"> What you can try is to observe what you say for two weeks.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.080" end="01:14:19.570" style="s2"> You have to detach yourself again, from yourself.</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.570" end="01:14:30.290" style="s2"> You must suspend the belief that your thoughts and you are the same.</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.290" end="01:14:36.850" style="s2"> Then you observe what you say, and watch ...</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.850" end="01:14:41.780" style="s2"> and Rogers would also advocate this ... you have to watch what you say, your feeling ...</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.780" end="01:14:48.730" style="s2"> you have to see if what you say improves or deteriorates the quality of your life.</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.730" end="01:14:53.700" style="s2"> And if you stop believing what you&#39;re saying and look at the consequences instead,</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.700" end="01:14:59.140" style="s2"> how it manifests as a change of your existence, then you can too</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.140" end="01:15:03.750" style="s2"> learn to say only things that improve the quality of being.</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.750" end="01:15:09.810" style="s2"> That&#39;s a good thing if you can, but it&#39;s also terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.810" end="01:15:14.540" style="s2"> for you will find that almost nothing you say does.</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.540" end="01:15:18.950" style="s2"> Most of it is neutral, but quite a bit has the exact opposite effect.</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.950" end="01:15:22.250" style="s2"> It makes things worse.</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.250" end="01:15:29.190" style="s2"> I think I&#39;ve noticed the word &quot;phenomenon,&quot; which is true of the term</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.190" end="01:15:31.060" style="s2"> &quot;phenomenology&quot; comes from,</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.060" end="01:15:36.060" style="s2"> the word &quot;phenomenon&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;phainesthai.&quot; And phainesthai means</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.060" end="01:15:38.470" style="s2"> &quot;(to show up.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.470" end="01:15:46.280" style="s2"> The phenomenologists state that being consists of meanings that appear to you,</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.280" end="01:15:49.640" style="s2"> and that those different meanings attract you.</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.640" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2"> They are like signposts for you to follow.</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:57.000" style="s2"> I noticed this when reading, for example.</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.000" end="01:16:01.360" style="s2"> I am reading a complex text, and a particular passage hits me.</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.360" end="01:16:03.720" style="s2"> It manifests as meaningful.</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.720" end="01:16:05.200" style="s2"> Why?</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.200" end="01:16:10.620" style="s2"> One of the phenomenologists, Binswanger, would say that</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.620" end="01:16:15.420" style="s2"> that&#39;s because of the way I&#39;m structured. But Boss would say, &quot;No, it&#39;s a dance,</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.420" end="01:16:22.650" style="s2"> that takes place within the structure of everything, and the result thereof is the manifestation of</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.650" end="01:16:23.740" style="s2"> this meaning. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.740" end="01:16:29.640" style="s2"> It has been my experience that I can follow red lines of meaning in different books,</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.640" end="01:16:34.860" style="s2"> it&#39;s something that guides me, that sense of meaning. I often find something</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.860" end="01:16:39.210" style="s2"> in a book that is meaningful, and then I read the other things that that person wrote.</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.210" end="01:16:43.830" style="s2"> And then I see if the people he&#39;s read have meaningful things to say,</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.830" end="01:16:48.670" style="s2"> and then I can expand that network. You follow a road that is there for you</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.670" end="01:16:54.250" style="s2"> who is prepared for you in the world. The phenomenological idea is</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.250" end="01:17:01.600" style="s2"> that if you follow that road ... what happens then, they are more and more</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.600" end="01:17:10.600" style="s2"> will be integrated around you. And those experiences of intrinsic significance begin to multiply,</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.600" end="01:17:16.240" style="s2"> and become more and more intense, and if you are able to, for a longer period of time,</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.240" end="01:17:22.440" style="s2"> then an increasing part of you will be, revealing kind of meanings</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.440" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2"> that keep you from becoming nihilistic or totalitarian.</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.480" end="01:17:32.780" style="s2"> That is the fundamental theory of phenomenological psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.780" end="01:17:33.780" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="01:17:33.780" end="01:17:37.420" style="s2"> You can say, &quot;You are depressed and tense, and you are not doing well</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.420" end="01:17:38.420" style="s2"> with your life.</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.420" end="01:17:40.490" style="s2"> What are you holding up? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.490" end="01:17:48.340" style="s2"> You have to observe that. And then we can say, &quot;Are there ways we</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.350" end="01:17:53.890" style="s2"> enlarge that small area that keeps you upright? So that more and more</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.890" end="01:17:59.570" style="s2"> of your experience, and push back the neutral or negative elements. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.570" end="01:18:09.480" style="s2"> This is largely due to attention and the willingness to</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.480" end="01:18:15.440" style="s2"> 1) treat things as if their meaning is real, and 2) allow that to be reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.440" end="01:18:24.720" style="s2"> transforms the way you will experience things in the future.</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.720" end="01:18:25.410" style="s2"> Till Thursday.</p>
