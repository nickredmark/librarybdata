<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:56.850" style="s2">that would be the result so a rather</p>

<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:05.100" style="s2">bit though on the assessment that it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.070" end="00:06:08.729" style="s2">the left because really it isn&#39;t one</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.100" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">left there is an ascendant orthodoxy on</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.729" end="00:06:14.910" style="s2">the left that is very troubling</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:18.660" style="s2">it is quite broad but I think not very</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.910" end="00:06:20.910" style="s2">deep then there&#39;s a concentrated mirror</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.660" end="00:06:24.450" style="s2">image of that on the far right and both</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.910" end="00:06:27.090" style="s2">of these things are to be feared the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.450" end="00:06:29.460" style="s2">problem though is when you speak out on</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.090" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">a college campus from a perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.460" end="00:06:32.490" style="s2">the left that does not fit this</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.620" end="00:06:53.949" style="s2">free speech zone or neither thank you</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.129" end="00:06:57.650" style="s2">for asking me that question</p>

<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:03.860" style="s2">safe to me well I believe in something</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.279" end="00:07:05.870" style="s2">that could be called a safe space but</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.860" end="00:07:08.419" style="s2">what safe space means to me as an</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.870" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">educator is a space safe enough to take</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.419" end="00:07:12.379" style="s2">risks which is roughly the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.449" style="s2">meaning of what is being invoked on</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.379" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">college campuses the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.449" end="00:07:19.159" style="s2">question is that a free-speech zone</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:21.259" style="s2">cannot coexist with a safe space because</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.159" end="00:07:23.150" style="s2">a safe space by definition according to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.259" end="00:07:26.419" style="s2">this orthodoxy is a place where you are</p>

<p begin="00:07:26.419" end="00:07:30.979" style="s2">is mutually exclusive but if you would</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.909" end="00:07:34.129" style="s2">allow me to I feel that there&#39;s a safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.979" end="00:07:37.639" style="s2">space could you say this sentence could</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.129" end="00:07:39.169" style="s2">you say Donald Trump is President of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.639" end="00:07:41.089" style="s2">United States could you say that in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.169" end="00:07:43.370" style="s2">safe space on college campuses today</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.089" end="00:07:45.110" style="s2">well it depends which version of safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.370" end="00:07:47.360" style="s2">space you mean if you mean a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.110" end="00:07:50.750" style="s2">the way it is used in common parlance on</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:52.250" style="s2">college campuses today then the question</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.750" end="00:07:54.110" style="s2">of whether or not you can say it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.250" end="00:07:55.669" style="s2">contingent on whether or not somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:07:56.750" style="s2">will be offended by that observation</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.669" end="00:08:00.099" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.750" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t even state a fact a fact</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.099" end="00:08:04.759" style="s2">provable all right I saw his tweet this</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.759" end="00:08:10.639" style="s2">right mr. chairman oh you cannot do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.819" end="00:08:12.949" style="s2">this shows the absurdity of what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:15.349" style="s2">going on on campuses and you have lived</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.949" end="00:08:17.810" style="s2">it in a physical way doctor Stanger has</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.349" end="00:08:18.529" style="s2">lived it in a physical way this is what</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.810" end="00:08:20.599" style="s2">is scary</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.529" end="00:08:21.830" style="s2">dr. Stanger&#39;s raising her head at mr.</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.599" end="00:08:23.810" style="s2">Weinstein you have the floor so you&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.270" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">enough to warrant a minute or two we are</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.810" style="s2">against the bluntness of the tool that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.979" end="00:08:39.469" style="s2">we have at our disposal for discussing</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.810" end="00:08:40.760" style="s2">the issue at hand so there is importance</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.469" end="00:08:44.540" style="s2">to what takes place on a college campus</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.760" end="00:08:46.310" style="s2">free expression is an a a key feature of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.540" end="00:08:48.860" style="s2">what takes place on college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.310" end="00:08:50.839" style="s2">that make civilization function but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.860" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">application of the First Amendment to</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.839" end="00:08:55.420" style="s2">that free expression is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:57.639" style="s2">almost arbitrary does it matter more</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.420" end="00:08:59.709" style="s2">that something takes place at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.639" end="00:09:01.510" style="s2">which happens to be public than if it</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.709" end="00:09:04.329" style="s2">takes place at Harvard which happens to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.510" end="00:09:08.260" style="s2">be private do those distinctions even</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.329" end="00:09:10.240" style="s2">make any sense when fully 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.260" end="00:09:11.980" style="s2">funding that drives Evergreen is private</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.240" end="00:09:13.660" style="s2">tuition money and I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.980" end="00:09:16.600" style="s2">fraction but a very large fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.660" end="00:09:20.139" style="s2">what drives Harvard is NIH and NSF money</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.600" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">so these distinctions are arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.139" end="00:09:24.850" style="s2">what we should be protecting is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:28.180" style="s2">ability to exchange ideas in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.850" end="00:09:30.040" style="s2">actually allows education it is also</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:31.449" style="s2">true that when people self-censor</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.040" end="00:09:33.610" style="s2">because they&#39;re afraid of stigma they</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.449" end="00:09:35.740" style="s2">may never get around to the place where</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.610" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">somebody blocks their speech and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.740" end="00:09:39.639" style="s2">there may be no technical violation but</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.839" end="00:09:42.820" style="s2">nonetheless the effect is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.639" end="00:09:44.350" style="s2">same there is also a problem in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.820" end="00:09:46.420" style="s2">sense that the conflict is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.350" end="00:09:48.100" style="s2">between members of the audience one</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.420" end="00:09:50.139" style="s2">section of the audience is deciding what</p>

<p begin="00:09:52.570" end="00:09:56.019" style="s2">is almost beside the point it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.579" end="00:09:58.630" style="s2">question of whether you can choose what</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.019" end="00:10:00.550" style="s2">you want to entertain as a concept and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.630" end="00:10:02.620" style="s2">then when this jumps the fence and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.550" end="00:10:04.990" style="s2">leaves the college campuses and moves</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.620" end="00:10:06.490" style="s2">into the outer world we&#39;re gonna run</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.990" end="00:10:08.589" style="s2">into an even bigger problem where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.490" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">tech sector is now the de-facto</p>

<p begin="00:10:13.029" end="00:10:16.420" style="s2">Amendment doesn&#39;t apply take the example</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.889" end="00:10:18.670" style="s2">of Harvard which you talked about dr.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.420" end="00:10:20.709" style="s2">Weinstein whether it&#39;s DoD funds whether</p>

<p begin="00:10:38.500" end="00:10:43.510" style="s2">fellowships and I think that is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.870" end="00:10:45.190" style="s2">significant overstep of the university&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.510" end="00:10:46.810" style="s2">role I wanted to give other panelists an</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.190" end="00:10:48.819" style="s2">opportunity to respond dr. Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.810" end="00:10:50.110" style="s2">well the first thing to say is I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.819" end="00:10:52.630" style="s2">legal expert but I would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.110" end="00:10:54.040" style="s2">support the idea that leverage generated</p>

<p begin="00:10:56.649" end="00:11:00.010" style="s2">would morally be justified to use that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.449" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">to make sure that college campuses</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.010" end="00:11:05.170" style="s2">protect the free expression but I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:05.800" style="s2">also point out that this is not just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.170" end="00:11:08.260" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:10.330" style="s2">abstract ideas presented by speakers on</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.330" end="00:11:15.790" style="s2">classroom and it&#39;s a question of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.390" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">one can properly teach in a biology</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.790" end="00:11:19.510" style="s2">class for example which may well not be</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.800" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">politically correct but it&#39;s nonetheless</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.510" end="00:11:24.990" style="s2">necessary for students to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:27.700" style="s2">organism that they&#39;re studying so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.990" end="00:11:30.310" style="s2">ultimately this is going to manifest in</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.700" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">our competitiveness as a nation if we</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.310" end="00:11:33.190" style="s2">decide that there are certain things</p>

<p begin="00:11:33.190" end="00:11:37.060" style="s2">stated in a college classroom then our</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.060" end="00:11:40.750" style="s2">to any nation that can solve that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.529" end="00:11:44.200" style="s2">problem so this is really a critical</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.750" end="00:11:48.190" style="s2">issue and the use of those funds to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.200" end="00:11:50.890" style="s2">keep the the campus square open is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.190" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">entirely valid in my opinion what can we</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.890" end="00:11:55.089" style="s2">do so we&#39;re not having these ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">PC controversies for the rest of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.089" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">lives so we can really try to work out</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:01.420" style="s2">some good ground rules</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:05.140" style="s2">yes dr. Weinstein so there&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.420" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">tension between the duty of a college or</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.140" end="00:12:09.970" style="s2">university to curate the content so that</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:12.970" style="s2">the students are encountering things</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.970" end="00:12:15.190" style="s2">that enrich them and it&#39;s duty to guard</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.970" end="00:12:16.839" style="s2">freedom of expression and and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.190" end="00:12:19.029" style="s2">just could be honest about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.839" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">that tension exists I mean peer review</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.029" end="00:12:24.370" style="s2">does shut down viewpoints that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:25.750" style="s2">deemed of a high quality and that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.370" end="00:12:29.020" style="s2">don&#39;t commonly take that to be an</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.750" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">infringement of free speech as to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.020" end="00:12:33.390" style="s2">question about the effect of something</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:36.120" style="s2">like the University of Chicago letter I</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.390" end="00:12:38.980" style="s2">must say that there&#39;s a paradox here for</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.120" end="00:12:41.170" style="s2">those who espouse a libertarian economic</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.980" end="00:12:42.670" style="s2">perspective which is the Chicago letter</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.170" end="00:12:44.860" style="s2">would seem to protect freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.670" end="00:12:48.209" style="s2">expression better than any other campus</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.860" end="00:12:50.649" style="s2">on in the nation that I&#39;m aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.209" end="00:12:52.630" style="s2">presumably will give students who go</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.649" end="00:12:54.520" style="s2">there a competitive edge because they</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.630" end="00:12:56.470" style="s2">will have been exposed to challenging</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.520" end="00:12:59.800" style="s2">ideas and will have sharpened their</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.470" end="00:13:02.260" style="s2">toolkit in response and so why is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.800" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">letter not spreading why are college</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.260" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">campuses not falling all over themselves</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:08.949" style="s2">to embrace this in order to collect</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">those students who are looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.949" end="00:13:13.510" style="s2">college campus that will expose them to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.770" style="s2">the highest quality material available</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.510" end="00:13:16.300" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.770" end="00:13:18.040" style="s2">question but I do find it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.300" end="00:13:19.750" style="s2">that Chicago was able to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.040" end="00:13:21.610" style="s2">these things and survive it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.750" end="00:13:25.690" style="s2">their colleges have not embraced the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.610" end="00:13:29.310" style="s2">same principles we really don&#39;t prepare</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.690" end="00:13:32.410" style="s2">most college faculty to be good</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.310" end="00:13:33.910" style="s2">instructors in essence and had dawned on</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.410" end="00:13:35.590" style="s2">me until I had the good fortune for most</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.910" end="00:13:37.260" style="s2">of having it had dawned on me until he</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.590" end="00:13:39.640" style="s2">said that there&#39;s you sure absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.260" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">dr. Weinstein would what can you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.640" end="00:13:43.720" style="s2">well let me add something to that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.220" end="00:13:47.800" style="s2">are quite right that we don&#39;t train</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.720" end="00:13:51.250" style="s2">people to teach and we also never spell</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.800" end="00:13:52.990" style="s2">out that the the job of an educator is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.250" end="00:13:54.940" style="s2">to teach you how to think not what to</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.990" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">think a fact if somebody at the front of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.940" end="00:13:58.270" style="s2">the room happens to have a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:00.130" style="s2">that they hold dear shouldn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.270" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">they are attempting to transmit it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.130" end="00:14:04.590" style="s2">students wholesale they should give them</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">the tools to evaluate for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.590" end="00:14:12.610" style="s2">unfortunately what we are seeing is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:15.550" style="s2">result of the politicization of of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.550" end="00:14:20.080" style="s2">the result of two things which is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.230" end="00:14:23.800" style="s2">people do not feel well represented by</p>

<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:39.670" style="s2">people have to understand that they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.980" end="00:14:42.010" style="s2">more to gain by being patriotic together</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.670" end="00:14:45.160" style="s2">than by fighting each other for scraps</p>
