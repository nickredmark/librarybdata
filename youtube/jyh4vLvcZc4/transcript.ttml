<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:43.020" style="s2">those time sections but I kind of do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.550" end="00:00:44.940" style="s2">a little bit like the idea cafe where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">give everyone a chance to to share</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.940" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">during each section if there&#39;s only four</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.300" style="s2">of us so if anyone would like to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:54.750" style="s2">as to what mental / emotional health</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.300" end="00:00:58.289" style="s2">looks like right now whether that&#39;s open</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.289" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">you well it&#39;s a bloody mess isn&#39;t it I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:10.409" style="s2">mean we still have this it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.430" end="00:01:11.010" style="s2">significantly what&#39;s the word I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:14.790" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.010" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">stigma attached to attached to mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.790" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">health issues you know I mean it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:20.880" style="s2">buckle up and get on with it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:25.229" style="s2">thing is still a very widely prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.880" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">attitude and so yeah it&#39;s kind of swept</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.229" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">under the carpet to a very large degree</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">it seems to me and not really talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:32.310" style="s2">about and not really acknowledged and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">lots of people who probably have mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.310" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">health issues choose not to investigate</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">and get the diagnose get them treated</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">because they feel ashamed because of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a very same stigma and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:46.439" style="s2">it&#39;s a bloody mess a light needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">shown on it not in a oh look at them</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.439" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">look at them kind of way but but you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">know that it needs to be seen more</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">clearly I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.870" end="00:02:06.920" style="s2">or generic yeah alright um so from my</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.300" end="00:02:09.640" style="s2">perspective I see where we are with</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.920" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">mental health kind of like where</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.640" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">internal medicine was 150 years ago like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">we look back at 150 years ago and look</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:18.020" style="s2">at that they would do bloodletting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:20.090" style="s2">use leeches and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.020" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">in order to treat people I kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.090" end="00:02:26.060" style="s2">that that&#39;s where we are in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">evolution of mental health I think that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.060" end="00:02:31.459" style="s2">up until this point this the the tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">that we have had for mental health God</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.459" end="00:02:37.130" style="s2">asked me where we need like have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:40.280" style="s2">us has served their purpose I had you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.130" end="00:02:44.390" style="s2">know the medications and treatments that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.280" end="00:02:46.190" style="s2">we used I think worked because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.390" end="00:02:48.739" style="s2">suppress everything which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.190" end="00:02:52.220" style="s2">what was needed until we had more tools</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.739" end="00:02:53.959" style="s2">more more options more things available</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">which is I think what we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.959" end="00:02:55.910" style="s2">have now and we&#39;ll talk about that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:57.950" style="s2">we get to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.910" end="00:03:01.400" style="s2">right now what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.950" end="00:03:04.209" style="s2">dealing where we&#39;re dealing with when</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.400" end="00:03:07.489" style="s2">when you go in to get treated you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.209" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">they don&#39;t really know what to treat us</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.489" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">so they&#39;ll start with something and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:13.340" style="s2">depending on on what the side effects</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:15.110" style="s2">aren&#39;t then okay maybe this works maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.340" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t without a few more few more</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.110" end="00:03:18.440" style="s2">things in there to balance out the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:23.930" style="s2">side effects with what this medication</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.440" end="00:03:31.480" style="s2">is doing for you and there is a this</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.930" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">blunt idea of a blank on the phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.480" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">know that there&#39;s something something</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">wrong with the neuro chemicals and well</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:42.110" style="s2">yes there&#39;s more to it there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:44.269" style="s2">it than that and right now the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.110" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">doctors don&#39;t have a ton of visibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.269" end="00:03:50.209" style="s2">into how is this medication going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:52.250" style="s2">affect this individual they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.209" end="00:03:54.980" style="s2">have that visibility and so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.250" end="00:03:58.280" style="s2">left with is people who are given the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.980" end="00:04:00.140" style="s2">medication said said sent home and said</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.280" end="00:04:02.930" style="s2">here try this for a month and see how it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.140" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">works and then they come back in a month</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.930" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">either you know with whatever side</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.080" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">there is a a side effect from Medicaid</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:18.170" style="s2">from certain medications called</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:19.820" style="s2">akathisia it is one of the most painful</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.170" end="00:04:21.170" style="s2">things we have ever experienced in your</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.820" end="00:04:23.180" style="s2">life because it is like there are bugs</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.170" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">crawling under your skin and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.180" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">they think that and sometimes listen is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:29.300" style="s2">like the best option that people have</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:30.920" style="s2">that is something that&#39;s very common</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.300" end="00:04:32.960" style="s2">with medications that treat</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.920" end="00:04:34.640" style="s2">schizophrenia and so it&#39;s a first night</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.960" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">and then and the other side effects with</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.640" end="00:04:40.910" style="s2">the idea with are massive amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">weight gain or a just like absolute</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.910" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">deadening of your senses and so right</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">now this treatment that we have we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.940" style="s2">going to give you this medication we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:52.220" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.940" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">affect you and and it might have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.220" end="00:04:57.169" style="s2">horrible side effects but it will at</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:59.480" style="s2">least prevent you from demonstrating</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.169" end="00:05:01.760" style="s2">these behaviors that make everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.480" end="00:05:07.730" style="s2">uncomfortable at least that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.760" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">projection and then you know and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.730" end="00:05:18.080" style="s2">also have you know that yes there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:19.400" style="s2">stigma and there is yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.080" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">how long I have so I&#39;m gonna leave it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.400" end="00:05:28.330" style="s2">there because I could go on for a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:31.700" style="s2">long time on this particular subject I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.330" end="00:05:35.570" style="s2">think I agree with all of both what you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.700" end="00:05:38.930" style="s2">said and I just wanted to add to that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.570" end="00:05:41.060" style="s2">guess is I think currently we deal with</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.930" end="00:05:43.070" style="s2">mental health it&#39;s like the person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.060" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">problem it&#39;s the individuals problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.070" end="00:05:49.540" style="s2">dealing with the mental health issue and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.020" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">I personally feel that it&#39;s a result of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.540" end="00:05:57.020" style="s2">our society our current conditions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:59.180" style="s2">the loss of any control of that really</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.020" end="00:06:01.220" style="s2">adds to it and exacerbates it and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.180" end="00:06:04.760" style="s2">I think we&#39;re at a point where we really</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.220" end="00:06:09.080" style="s2">need to do more group processing more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.760" end="00:06:11.210" style="s2">group work with mental health and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.080" end="00:06:14.090" style="s2">think that&#39;s really successful because</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.210" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">not only are you not alone you also see</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.090" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">other people going through the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:18.650" style="s2">thing and how they&#39;re dealing with it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.000" end="00:06:20.480" style="s2">I just wanted to put that in there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.650" end="00:06:23.450" style="s2">hope that we touch on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.480" end="00:06:25.070" style="s2">yeah just just before Jubilee shares I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.450" end="00:06:29.210" style="s2">really like to amplify what you just</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.070" end="00:06:32.540" style="s2">said there that the mental health is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.210" end="00:06:33.920" style="s2">symptom of really profoundly ill Society</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.540" end="00:06:38.630" style="s2">i reaiiy really agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.920" end="00:06:40.280" style="s2">really agree with that there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.630" end="00:06:41.750" style="s2">individual ways to tackle it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.280" end="00:06:43.010" style="s2">societal ways and you can&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.750" end="00:06:46.370" style="s2">one without the other that as</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.220" end="00:07:15.200" style="s2">but the not vast number of people who</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.160" end="00:07:34.970" style="s2">complex PTSD and both of them especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.540" end="00:07:36.470" style="s2">anxiety when I when I got diagnosed with</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.970" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">that and I went to my doctor was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.470" end="00:07:39.200" style="s2">well that&#39;s what this is he was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.210" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve known you haven&#39;t had anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.200" end="00:07:43.820" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want to like get you diagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.210" end="00:07:45.320" style="s2">because of the stigma it was like okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.820" end="00:07:47.510" style="s2">but now that I know this is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:49.760" style="s2">now that I can name it I can get like</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.510" end="00:07:52.910" style="s2">this stone that&#39;s been in my belly my</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.760" end="00:07:55.250" style="s2">whole life it&#39;s constantly present I can</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.910" end="00:07:58.460" style="s2">just be more aware of it and deal with</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.250" end="00:08:01.160" style="s2">it and the complex PTSD was actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.460" end="00:08:03.290" style="s2">diagnosed by psychiatrist in like a one</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.160" end="00:08:05.570" style="s2">hour like it&#39;s like can you diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.290" end="00:08:07.910" style="s2">something in that time period the mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.570" end="00:08:10.820" style="s2">health Canadian healthcare system I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.910" end="00:08:12.830" style="s2">think is very good except when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.820" end="00:08:14.930" style="s2">to mental health if you want to get I</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.830" end="00:08:16.460" style="s2">had a doctor every doctor I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.930" end="00:08:18.770" style="s2">because every condition I have is either</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">neurological or mental they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.770" end="00:08:21.350" style="s2">the difference</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:23.030" style="s2">so like chronic pain is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.350" end="00:08:24.830" style="s2">that&#39;s in your it&#39;s in your brain but</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.030" end="00:08:27.320" style="s2">all pains in your brain it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.830" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">you who have pain associated outside of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.320" end="00:08:31.070" style="s2">your brain it&#39;s just whether there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.810" style="s2">actual injury or not and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.070" end="00:08:33.080" style="s2">that if it&#39;s mental you should be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.810" end="00:08:33.950" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.080" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">you look at and you should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.950" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">figure that out but actually it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">harder if you&#39;re not like a physical</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:42.020" style="s2">thing know that you know I can see it on</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:46.580" style="s2">x-ray can see on and ride the theme</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.020" end="00:08:48.530" style="s2">mount that&#39;s kind of we go to that all</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.580" end="00:08:50.180" style="s2">the doctors give of like it&#39;s mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.530" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">and then there&#39;s no help for the mental</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">and you&#39;re not allowed to really help</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:54.890" style="s2">yourself right like if we wanted to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:08:56.420" style="s2">together and have mental health circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.890" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">there&#39;s some barrier to that because</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.420" end="00:09:01.370" style="s2">moments are a psychiatrist right we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">to like put it and not underplay go get</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.370" end="00:09:07.340" style="s2">your own medical advice and then come</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">back and I think that just like how our</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.340" end="00:09:10.400" style="s2">medical system works currently where</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">everyone has their own expertise and no</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.400" end="00:09:14.030" style="s2">one kind of passed the buck to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">else didn&#39;t know but especially that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.030" end="00:09:17.480" style="s2">develop the story I tried this trench</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">start was that I was told to go see a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.480" end="00:09:21.350" style="s2">psychiatrist I got in it took like who</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.960" style="s2">wants to get in which was really good</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.350" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">and and when I saw him he was like now</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.960" end="00:09:28.250" style="s2">you got the idea of calling he what he</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:29.900" style="s2">was like yes I agree upon he&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.250" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">one who and he&#39;s like I need to see</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.900" end="00:09:34.760" style="s2">uniquely a minimum of once a week it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:36.650" style="s2">like cool I went out to schedule with</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.760" end="00:09:40.310" style="s2">his secretary and it was three months</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.650" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">down the road I was like okay but I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:47.330" style="s2">like okay so can I schedule weekly no so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:48.170" style="s2">what&#39;s the point in coming in and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.330" end="00:09:49.880" style="s2">you every three months</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.170" end="00:09:52.010" style="s2">they heat everything up and I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.880" end="00:09:53.810" style="s2">home and deal with it there&#39;s no safety</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:56.360" style="s2">there there&#39;s no like I couldn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.810" end="00:09:59.390" style="s2">tackle it so it&#39;s it&#39;s just a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.360" end="00:10:02.150" style="s2">weird great area in our society where</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.390" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">they put everything up to it it offer no</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.150" end="00:10:07.250" style="s2">help and it&#39;s all on the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:10.040" style="s2">not on society and it&#39;s just makes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.250" end="00:10:13.850" style="s2">feel broken and having gone through it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.040" end="00:10:16.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve reduced my anxiety hugely my</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.850" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">complex PTSD I don&#39;t know how no it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:21.910" style="s2">ongoing thing it&#39;s doing medical</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">pandemics not necessarily helping but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.910" end="00:10:25.520" style="s2">would love to see what we come up with</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.110" end="00:10:29.060" style="s2">in the next two sections so we know a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.520" end="00:10:31.240" style="s2">few more minutes here at anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.060" end="00:10:31.240" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.530" end="00:10:37.010" style="s2">yeah I mean I guess this source is</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.570" end="00:10:39.170" style="s2">somewhat spills over into the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.010" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">section but it was just it was occurring</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.170" end="00:10:42.770" style="s2">to me as you were talking there do</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:46.820" style="s2">believe that it would be nice if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.770" end="00:10:49.130" style="s2">could view those who rather than call it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.820" end="00:10:51.890" style="s2">mental health issues call it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.130" end="00:10:53.870" style="s2">know different different cognate</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.890" end="00:10:56.440" style="s2">different cognition or something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.870" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">that right a somewhat more neutral term</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.440" end="00:11:02.060" style="s2">and value it in the sense that they see</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:04.520" style="s2">the world in the way that very few other</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.060" end="00:11:07.730" style="s2">people do and that potentially gives all</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.520" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">of us access to a rare perspective you</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:10.790" style="s2">know what I mean who knows what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:13.570" style="s2">value of that could be and so rather</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.790" end="00:11:16.460" style="s2">than seeing it as a problem seeing it as</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.570" end="00:11:19.160" style="s2">you know a valuable difference that kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.460" end="00:11:20.930" style="s2">of thing I think we do Duke we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.160" end="00:11:23.630" style="s2">starting to do that like one Kyra said</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.930" end="00:11:27.320" style="s2">rubber in the bloodletting event I like</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.630" end="00:11:29.270" style="s2">that they chose like for autism and a TB</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.320" end="00:11:31.970" style="s2">especially we talked about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.270" end="00:11:34.070" style="s2">of neurodiversity and that there is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.970" end="00:11:35.060" style="s2">that gift that you bring to society even</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.070" end="00:11:36.980" style="s2">though there is a lot of ableism</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.060" end="00:11:38.810" style="s2">surrounding it and people that are like</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.980" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">whoa but we want to cure autism right</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.810" end="00:11:42.500" style="s2">but we want to like not have a TD right</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:44.630" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s even harder like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.500" end="00:11:46.820" style="s2">hard to get it around that and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.630" end="00:11:48.320" style="s2">even it&#39;s like well at least it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.820" end="00:11:50.630" style="s2">rain damage at least it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.320" end="00:11:52.670" style="s2">schizophrenia at least it&#39;s not and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.630" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">like that&#39;s just more ableism of like</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.670" end="00:11:56.690" style="s2">you&#39;re everyone&#39;s brain is me every</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:11:59.960" style="s2">single person you actually can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.690" end="00:12:01.490" style="s2">what anyone else&#39;s brain is like you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.960" end="00:12:03.110" style="s2">kind of only go to a doctor and get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.490" end="00:12:07.780" style="s2">diagnosis or read the symptoms and get a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.110" end="00:12:10.430" style="s2">diagnosis and it&#39;s their best guess and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.780" end="00:12:12.080" style="s2">like I like what you said Eric that like</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.430" end="00:12:14.140" style="s2">it is the diversity that&#39;s that I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.080" end="00:12:17.030" style="s2">is gonna save us but there&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.140" end="00:12:18.680" style="s2">neurodiversity side and I&#39;d be like no</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.030" end="00:12:19.970" style="s2">no this side we have to heal and I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.680" end="00:12:23.390" style="s2">it&#39;s all actually under the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.970" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">category your diversity is part of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.390" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">you&#39;re here to give if you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.100" end="00:12:28.940" style="s2">and the rest of the Western society</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:31.070" style="s2">catching up and being there would make</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.940" end="00:12:34.000" style="s2">it a lot easier for everyone dealing</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.070" end="00:12:35.660" style="s2">with any kind of neuro diversity or</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.000" end="00:12:38.420" style="s2">neurotypicals which I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.660" end="00:12:40.010" style="s2">actually exists I hope because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.420" end="00:12:41.870" style="s2">one so I&#39;m like I couldn&#39;t possibly</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.010" end="00:13:20.930" style="s2">stemmed from that that&#39;s where why we</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.830" end="00:13:54.040" style="s2">quite right but it&#39;s like there there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.740" end="00:14:08.750" style="s2">like for a lot of people like they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.860" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">all these feelings you know from my</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.750" end="00:14:11.840" style="s2">perspective what mental health is is for</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:13.490" style="s2">a lot of people there&#39;s a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.840" end="00:14:14.570" style="s2">feelings that are coming up they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.490" end="00:14:15.680" style="s2">know what they are they don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.570" end="00:14:18.620" style="s2">to describe them they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.680" end="00:14:20.390" style="s2">language for them and so oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.620" end="00:14:23.710" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling anxiety here&#39;s a pill</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.390" end="00:14:28.930" style="s2">take two in order to deal with that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.710" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">first got diagnosed when I was 15 or 16</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.930" end="00:14:35.420" style="s2">initially with depression then later</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:40.970" style="s2">with bipolar disorder I&#39;ve had diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.420" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">of PTSD bipolar disorder not otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.970" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">specified I mean like there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:46.370" style="s2">whole bunch of different things and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:48.380" style="s2">actually now off of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.370" end="00:14:50.750" style="s2">medication because I learned that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.380" end="00:14:53.140" style="s2">because I cleared out that I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.750" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">deal with it another way for me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.140" end="00:15:00.350" style="s2">that&#39;s but this meaning crisis I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:02.300" style="s2">is a place</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.350" end="00:15:04.760" style="s2">huge part in the mental health crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.300" end="00:15:08.420" style="s2">because if you&#39;re looking out in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.760" end="00:15:09.860" style="s2">world and going for me it was realizing</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.420" end="00:15:12.860" style="s2">at one point oh wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.860" end="00:15:14.930" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to all of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.860" end="00:15:17.660" style="s2">been told on my life that are supposed</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.930" end="00:15:19.700" style="s2">to give me meaning don&#39;t actually make</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.660" end="00:15:21.320" style="s2">me feel fulfilled in any way and I have</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.700" end="00:15:22.910" style="s2">been trying I&#39;ve been suppressing these</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:27.860" style="s2">emotions since I was 16</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.910" end="00:15:31.460" style="s2">trying to achieve the the American dream</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.860" end="00:15:33.320" style="s2">or whatever it is and but I was feeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.460" end="00:15:36.080" style="s2">that all of these equities feelings that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.320" end="00:15:38.690" style="s2">because my system was trying to tell me</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.080" end="00:15:41.030" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing isn&#39;t great for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.690" end="00:15:42.620" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.030" end="00:15:44.330" style="s2">to have that conversation and so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.620" end="00:15:45.860" style="s2">meaning Chris so that meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.330" end="00:15:47.630" style="s2">thing I think is a huge part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.860" end="00:15:49.160" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to tell people know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.630" end="00:15:52.330" style="s2">this is how this is what&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.160" end="00:15:54.830" style="s2">give you meaning in your life and yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.330" end="00:15:56.330" style="s2">and and if you have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.830" end="00:15:57.800" style="s2">uncomfortable feelings that he&#39;s ready</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.330" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">you&#39;re anxious or you&#39;re depressed or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.800" end="00:16:00.890" style="s2">you&#39;re this or that</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:02.450" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s your system trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.890" end="00:16:05.270" style="s2">you that what you&#39;re pursuing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.450" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">actually what is going to serve you and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.270" end="00:16:11.510" style="s2">why so we are at the 60 minute mark we</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:14.150" style="s2">can switch over to what we would like in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.510" end="00:16:16.130" style="s2">our I feel version of our lives or</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.150" end="00:16:18.590" style="s2">society for for mental health and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.130" end="00:16:20.090" style="s2">emotional health and it doesn&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.590" end="00:16:22.550" style="s2">match so we don&#39;t need to again have</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.090" end="00:16:24.470" style="s2">like a boat on as to what our future is</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.550" end="00:16:28.010" style="s2">gonna look like they can be different</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.470" end="00:16:29.270" style="s2">it&#39;s just about what 5 10 100 years down</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.010" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">the road what would you like it to look</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.270" end="00:16:32.980" style="s2">like when we&#39;re not in the leech letting</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:38.420" style="s2">part of mental health</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.980" end="00:16:40.310" style="s2">bloodletting leeches well I could I</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.420" end="00:16:41.930" style="s2">could talk for an hour in the last</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.310" end="00:16:45.650" style="s2">section so it&#39;s probably good I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.930" end="00:16:50.240" style="s2">but going forward I would really love to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.650" end="00:16:54.010" style="s2">see more personal development education</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.240" end="00:16:57.410" style="s2">I think and self-awareness like</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.010" end="00:17:02.330" style="s2">recognizing your your body signals and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.410" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">how that is actually guiding you because</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.330" end="00:17:05.990" style="s2">I think here is exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">this meaning crisis that we&#39;ve directed</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.990" end="00:17:11.589" style="s2">everything funneled everybody into</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">certain systems of competition and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.589" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">like all the doctors had to be very</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:19.000" style="s2">successful in this competition based</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:20.380" style="s2">system but yet there might have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.000" end="00:17:21.429" style="s2">some other people that weren&#39;t so good</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.380" end="00:17:24.220" style="s2">in that system that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.429" end="00:17:28.049" style="s2">really great doctors just for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.220" end="00:17:31.750" style="s2">and if they maybe could have been more</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.049" end="00:17:34.630" style="s2">self-directing and even from a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.750" end="00:17:36.730" style="s2">young age because we&#39;re we&#39;re mislead at</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.630" end="00:17:39.580" style="s2">a very young age and therefore if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.730" end="00:17:42.279" style="s2">not part of the accepted ways you kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.580" end="00:17:44.860" style="s2">of feel unseen unheard undeveloped in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.279" end="00:17:48.520" style="s2">way so I&#39;d love to see that and as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.860" end="00:17:50.799" style="s2">artist now I realize art is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.520" end="00:17:54.520" style="s2">way to get you there because it really</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.799" end="00:17:56.529" style="s2">helps you get inside yourself and see</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.520" end="00:17:58.630" style="s2">who you are even though I mean I can</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.529" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">find art until I was in my late 30s so I</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.630" end="00:18:04.539" style="s2">mean anyway I just think the art is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:07.299" style="s2">huge key into as as well as listening if</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.539" end="00:18:09.039" style="s2">we can listen to people and what their</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.299" end="00:18:11.770" style="s2">desires are I feel like we could develop</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.039" end="00:18:14.049" style="s2">as human beings a lot better through</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.770" end="00:18:17.080" style="s2">self direction and learning what self</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.049" end="00:18:20.529" style="s2">Direction is at a young age I have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.080" end="00:18:22.059" style="s2">let my cat out I&#39;m dead I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.529" end="00:18:24.549" style="s2">completely agree with all of that I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.059" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">wanted say yes and there and add to it</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.549" end="00:18:29.740" style="s2">rituals and rites of passage you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:32.140" style="s2">meaning there are many rituals rites of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.740" end="00:18:34.179" style="s2">passage woven into the fabric of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.140" end="00:18:35.950" style="s2">culture because I mean we have we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.179" end="00:18:38.260" style="s2">nothing do you know what I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.950" end="00:18:40.419" style="s2">weddings and the funerals and and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.260" end="00:18:43.059" style="s2">the you know the the coming-of-age</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.419" end="00:18:45.580" style="s2">ceremonies that we do our empty shells</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.059" end="00:18:48.340" style="s2">of rituals you know what I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.580" end="00:18:51.669" style="s2">they long ago absented themselves of any</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.340" end="00:18:53.590" style="s2">any real meaning and so yeah that feels</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.669" end="00:18:57.190" style="s2">a super-important to me but yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.590" end="00:19:00.399" style="s2">educating people as to just opening</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.190" end="00:19:03.130" style="s2">their minds to the huge possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.399" end="00:19:05.529" style="s2">development and and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.130" end="00:19:08.950" style="s2">self-improvement that are out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.529" end="00:19:11.320" style="s2">rather than focusing on examinable</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.950" end="00:19:13.120" style="s2">content right you know the development</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.320" end="00:19:16.740" style="s2">of character being central to their turn</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.120" end="00:19:16.740" style="s2">to the notion of Education yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.100" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">one of the things that I would I want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:27.020" style="s2">see is the III like the direction that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:30.650" style="s2">we&#39;re going</p>

<p begin="00:19:40.039" end="00:19:48.890" style="s2">in is that take dealing with the mental</p>

<p begin="00:21:09.740" end="00:21:15.970" style="s2">working to survive then that exacerbates</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.700" end="00:21:20.260" style="s2">the mental health the Gunkel health</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.970" end="00:21:25.220" style="s2">issues and I agree with moving away from</p>

<p begin="00:21:25.220" end="00:21:29.540" style="s2">they&#39;re you&#39;re doing you&#39;re truly</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.140" end="00:21:32.600" style="s2">dealing with a mental health issue I</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.540" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">think in a lot of cases</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.600" end="00:21:39.420" style="s2">there you&#39;re dealing more with us with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:43.770" style="s2">spiritual issue than a mental health one</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.420" end="00:21:46.140" style="s2">but right now the only tool we have is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.770" end="00:21:47.700" style="s2">hammer so everything&#39;s a nail and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.140" end="00:21:49.800" style="s2">everything is treated like a mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.700" end="00:21:52.950" style="s2">health issue because we have lost any</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.800" end="00:21:54.960" style="s2">sense of spirituality and so which</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.950" end="00:22:05.310" style="s2">everything as though it&#39;s a mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:22:08.250" style="s2">health issue that is very tied I know</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.310" end="00:22:10.860" style="s2">for my journey I was so obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.250" end="00:22:12.540" style="s2">knowledge just based on Who I am as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.860" end="00:22:14.100" style="s2">person and what I wanted to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.540" end="00:22:16.350" style="s2">world that I crammed all this</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.100" end="00:22:18.330" style="s2">information in and it wasn&#39;t until I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.350" end="00:22:20.040" style="s2">truly didn&#39;t have the option anymore to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.330" end="00:22:21.390" style="s2">do that due to my brain changes which</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.040" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">aren&#39;t considered mental illness they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.390" end="00:22:29.040" style="s2">actually brain damage um I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:30.540" style="s2">sit and really cultivate wisdom and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.040" end="00:22:32.010" style="s2">weird cuz it doesn&#39;t for me anyway it</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.540" end="00:22:33.300" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like a stage sitting on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.010" end="00:22:36.450" style="s2">mountain like it doesn&#39;t look like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.300" end="00:22:38.130" style="s2">peaceful I have all the answers now it</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.450" end="00:22:40.050" style="s2">looks very different but its wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.130" end="00:22:41.370" style="s2">now I have my own shadow side of not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.050" end="00:22:42.990" style="s2">being able to handle when other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.370" end="00:22:44.190" style="s2">are like read this book do this I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.990" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">I&#39;m done with knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.190" end="00:22:47.850" style="s2">I just want wisdom I know that they</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:51.030" style="s2">interact with each other like you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.850" end="00:22:54.030" style="s2">to have both like we&#39;re so regimented</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.030" end="00:22:56.550" style="s2">towards seeking knowledge that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.030" end="00:22:58.860" style="s2">do any wisdom and so it&#39;s like well you</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.550" end="00:23:01.350" style="s2">know Darwin says thick&#39;s and mark says</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.860" end="00:23:04.980" style="s2">this like what do you think what do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.350" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">think and so a world that I would want</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.980" end="00:23:10.260" style="s2">to live in to UM realize from sticking</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:12.750" style="s2">to the topic there is one where whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.260" end="00:23:15.480" style="s2">whoever you are as an individual is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.750" end="00:23:16.980" style="s2">honored and so the four questions I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.480" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">been playing with and I&#39;m yet to know</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.980" end="00:23:21.690" style="s2">how to like bring them into the world in</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:23.520" style="s2">a way that&#39;s powerful is that we would</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.690" end="00:23:24.870" style="s2">have the tools and the community to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.520" end="00:23:26.490" style="s2">able to answer the four questions and</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.870" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">for Who am I at a deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.490" end="00:23:30.450" style="s2">level I think that&#39;s a spiritual and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:34.170" style="s2">emotional and mental that we are diverse</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.450" end="00:23:36.120" style="s2">and it is who we are both as unique</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.170" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">individuals and the groups that were</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.120" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">part of that maybe were not unique in</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:43.050" style="s2">but the combination of what we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:44.760" style="s2">seeing and the without the next question</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.050" end="00:23:45.820" style="s2">is like who are my people where can I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.760" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">find my connect</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.820" end="00:23:50.380" style="s2">and can we help people truly find where</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">they belong especially because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.380" end="00:23:54.730" style="s2">what looks like mental illness is just</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:59.170" style="s2">you be different than everybody else and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.730" end="00:24:01.000" style="s2">sometimes those differences are amazing</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.170" end="00:24:02.920" style="s2">I know when I found my artistic</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.000" end="00:24:03.340" style="s2">community who&#39;s like all these are my</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.920" end="00:24:06.130" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.340" end="00:24:08.290" style="s2">like I can and then gain B is not my</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.130" end="00:24:09.850" style="s2">autistic community but I&#39;m able to talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.290" end="00:24:12.280" style="s2">about my special interest which is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.850" end="00:24:14.260" style="s2">autistic thing in the community was just</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.280" end="00:24:15.490" style="s2">so big I can&#39;t imagine if everyone had</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.260" end="00:24:16.810" style="s2">that or they&#39;re like you know they want</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:19.480" style="s2">to talk about trains all day every day</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.810" end="00:24:21.250" style="s2">talk about trainings go ahead are ours</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.480" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">mine just happens to be like saving the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.250" end="00:24:24.100" style="s2">world they create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:25.210" style="s2">everyone including everything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.100" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">broken wrong with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.210" end="00:24:29.890" style="s2">and so a world where I people are able</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">to figure out who they are who their</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.890" end="00:24:33.910" style="s2">people are as well as what their purpose</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:35.860" style="s2">is ubi helps with that because your</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.910" end="00:24:38.740" style="s2">purpose isn&#39;t necessarily something you</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.860" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">get paid for that is only under our</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.740" end="00:24:42.370" style="s2">current ecosystem and so you have like</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:44.560" style="s2">it&#39;s here&#39;s your unique purpose unless</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.370" end="00:24:46.750" style="s2">it&#39;s in that realm of you know what&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.560" end="00:24:48.280" style="s2">be paid for it&#39;s not gonna it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:51.280" style="s2">gonna be there then the last question is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.280" end="00:24:52.660" style="s2">what resources do I need and so under</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.280" end="00:24:54.430" style="s2">the mental health umbrella that could be</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.660" end="00:24:56.560" style="s2">connection the connection to people and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.430" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">knowing who I am and self-help groups</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.560" end="00:25:02.800" style="s2">and psychiatrists if I need one and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:04.810" style="s2">drugs if I need them but not in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.800" end="00:25:06.880" style="s2">widespread system it currently is and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.810" end="00:25:09.490" style="s2">I would also like those drugs to be very</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.880" end="00:25:11.140" style="s2">focused very where it isn&#39;t just like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.490" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">throwing things and seeing if they stick</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.140" end="00:25:15.490" style="s2">at the wall like actual tests that show</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:17.860" style="s2">hey you have this genetics this drug</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.490" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">would be the best one for you and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.860" end="00:25:23.080" style="s2">feeding that back into the system so</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">that every new person who has to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.080" end="00:25:26.380" style="s2">through that actually gives more</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:27.490" style="s2">information so the next person has to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.380" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">through it a little bit last thing when</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.490" end="00:25:32.500" style="s2">you those drugs start working you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:34.570" style="s2">find find new ones and honoring that a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.500" end="00:25:38.110" style="s2">lot of the conditions are though</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.570" end="00:25:41.080" style="s2">spiritual physical societal and dealing</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.110" end="00:25:43.930" style="s2">with the full big picture of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.080" end="00:25:45.280" style="s2">individual health which encompasses you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.930" end="00:25:47.950" style="s2">know the mental the physical the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.280" end="00:25:51.040" style="s2">emotional spiritual and then those</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.950" end="00:25:52.870" style="s2">pieces in society as well so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.040" end="00:25:54.760" style="s2">bit of what I would like the future to</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.870" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">look like and maybe there isn&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.760" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">stigma towards mental health because it</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:00.659" style="s2">isn&#39;t seen as separate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:03.000" style="s2">you know schizophrenia is not seen as as</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.659" end="00:26:05.880" style="s2">a deficiency in your character whereas</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:07.740" style="s2">cancer isn&#39;t it&#39;s just is there as n</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.740" end="00:26:12.029" style="s2">powerful course if they want if we were</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.740" end="00:26:14.519" style="s2">if someone wants to use them I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.029" end="00:26:15.960" style="s2">think being prescribed mushrooms but my</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.519" end="00:26:19.049" style="s2">doctor seems like that would not be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.960" end="00:26:20.880" style="s2">great but being willing to have them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.049" end="00:26:23.100" style="s2">take them myself is a different a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.880" end="00:26:25.470" style="s2">different category and that I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.100" end="00:26:28.710" style="s2">all medical stuff I would like to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.470" end="00:26:30.779" style="s2">more in partnership with my medical team</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.710" end="00:26:32.429" style="s2">rather than this hierarchical structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.779" end="00:26:33.779" style="s2">of like I have the medical degree I know</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.429" end="00:26:35.519" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s like you are</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.779" end="00:26:37.559" style="s2">an expert in that but I&#39;m an expert</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.519" end="00:26:38.940" style="s2">you&#39;re an expert in one of them and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.559" end="00:26:41.610" style="s2">although I&#39;m not an expert in any of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.940" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">them I know the combination for my body</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.610" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">more than anyone else can and to honor</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">that that expertise of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.700" end="00:26:54.600" style="s2">this is EV a society of topic but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.289" end="00:26:56.730" style="s2">cycle you outlined of Who am I Who am I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.600" end="00:26:59.700" style="s2">people what&#39;s my purpose what do I need</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.730" end="00:27:02.100" style="s2">so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really really</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.700" end="00:27:03.690" style="s2">powerful cycle that I was thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.100" end="00:27:04.919" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard you say it before but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.690" end="00:27:08.490" style="s2">occurred to me just now as you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.919" end="00:27:11.159" style="s2">saying it that would work really nicely</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.490" end="00:27:13.559" style="s2">as the sort of beating heart at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.159" end="00:27:16.110" style="s2">center of what an education system is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.559" end="00:27:18.899" style="s2">right I mean that that you could build</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.110" end="00:27:20.429" style="s2">curricula around that spiral because</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.899" end="00:27:21.870" style="s2">it&#39;s iterative right and it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.429" end="00:27:26.639" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you go around it once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.870" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a constantly thing right and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.639" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:35.190" style="s2">sort of spiral thing working in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:37.830" style="s2">middle of Education would be awesome I</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.190" end="00:27:39.389" style="s2">mean that that that boils it right down</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.830" end="00:27:40.889" style="s2">to what you&#39;re actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.389" end="00:27:43.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re educating someone to develop</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.889" end="00:27:45.870" style="s2">them right and also the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.740" end="00:27:47.940" style="s2">Education going on for your whole life</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.870" end="00:27:50.549" style="s2">is also embedded in there right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.940" end="00:27:51.179" style="s2">just the school thing I I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.549" end="00:27:52.529" style="s2"> great</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.179" end="00:27:56.730" style="s2">are you should roll that out into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.529" end="00:27:58.259" style="s2">education discussion Jubilee I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.730" end="00:27:59.669" style="s2">think about in terms of education but no</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.259" end="00:28:02.220" style="s2">I know it&#39;s just occurred to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.669" end="00:28:05.210" style="s2">what I mean I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.220" end="00:28:05.210" style="s2">brilliantly in that domain</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.190" end="00:28:17.340" style="s2">nobody else is gonna go though I would</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.330" end="00:28:20.879" style="s2">like to in my perfect world I already</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.340" end="00:28:24.269" style="s2">see this others value system functioning</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.879" end="00:28:27.239" style="s2">for us so it&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.269" end="00:28:32.519" style="s2">you&#39;ve all connected in my mind part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.239" end="00:28:37.110" style="s2">it whereas like the universal income</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.519" end="00:28:40.379" style="s2">with mu VI or whatever in my system that</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.110" end="00:28:43.139" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought of to support kind of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.379" end="00:28:46.019" style="s2">humanitarian side our collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.139" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">connective it is like the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.019" end="00:28:51.059" style="s2">version of what our competition our</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:52.460" style="s2">competitive side is more than masculine</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.059" end="00:28:55.710" style="s2">and I think think of this as the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.460" end="00:29:00.840" style="s2">feminine and so I believe like having</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.710" end="00:29:04.309" style="s2">this structure in place is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.840" end="00:29:08.279" style="s2">way to value these things also a way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.309" end="00:29:12.119" style="s2">for education like in my mind it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.279" end="00:29:15.779" style="s2">multi-level value system so there is one</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.119" end="00:29:17.639" style="s2">level of it is like an income that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.779" end="00:29:20.639" style="s2">everyone gets that&#39;s the same let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.639" end="00:29:22.830" style="s2">so there is this part that you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.639" end="00:29:26.070" style="s2">exchange for services or whatnot in here</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.830" end="00:29:27.629" style="s2">you have these hubs that are actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.070" end="00:29:29.820" style="s2">physical places that you connect with</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.629" end="00:29:31.529" style="s2">your with other people in your area as</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.820" end="00:29:35.129" style="s2">well as you have the Internet you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.529" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">share your findings widely you can track</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.129" end="00:29:39.960" style="s2">all this information as well like for</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:41.399" style="s2">educating people like you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.960" end="00:29:44.879" style="s2">whole your whole life is an education</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.399" end="00:29:47.519" style="s2">time and even for children right now who</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.879" end="00:29:49.799" style="s2">not able to learn at school I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.519" end="00:29:51.779" style="s2">we can teach children how to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.799" end="00:29:54.330" style="s2">then let them decide what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.779" end="00:29:56.340" style="s2">learning and be able to track it through</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.330" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">this system so they&#39;re showing yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.340" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">wearing these things even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:06.419" style="s2">not what society expects us to be as</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:08.369" style="s2">long as we&#39;re developing and finding our</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.419" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">own way and I think that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.369" end="00:30:12.929" style="s2">wisdom because I think knowledge is what</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:14.549" style="s2">you&#39;re told to know and I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.929" end="00:30:16.470" style="s2">wisdom is what you learn and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.549" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">connections you make within yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.470" end="00:30:20.430" style="s2">about how you&#39;ve learned it so how you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:22.110" style="s2">got there it&#39;s not as easily</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.430" end="00:30:24.660" style="s2">told even though people can share and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.110" end="00:30:27.960" style="s2">then you can kind of make connections so</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.660" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">I feel and we&#39;re probably all seeing</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.960" end="00:30:33.180" style="s2">this new world this new game be whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">you want to call it in all of our own</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.180" end="00:30:38.370" style="s2">ways but I feel like we are all to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:40.890" style="s2">describe the same thing in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.370" end="00:30:45.570" style="s2">we&#39;re able to get to this new place I</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.890" end="00:30:47.310" style="s2">just wanted to say I love the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.570" end="00:30:51.950" style="s2">making these connections like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.310" end="00:30:54.770" style="s2">way that we can get to this better place</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.950" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a great segue into the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.770" end="00:30:59.820" style="s2">conversation which is what could we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:02.220" style="s2">actually do right now if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.820" end="00:31:06.210" style="s2">people and $100,000 and although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.220" end="00:31:07.250" style="s2">not part of the structure the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.210" end="00:31:09.780" style="s2">create something that&#39;s voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.250" end="00:31:11.730" style="s2">something that isn&#39;t you know top-down</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.780" end="00:31:13.620" style="s2">hierarchical these 10,000 hour rule the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.730" end="00:31:15.810" style="s2">world input it&#39;s like in creating a</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.620" end="00:31:18.090" style="s2">solution or something for 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.810" end="00:31:20.270" style="s2">with 10,000 people and then hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.090" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">inviting the world but the only real</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.270" end="00:31:27.110" style="s2">parameter is that it&#39;s doable with</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 right now I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.110" end="00:31:31.290" style="s2">usually concentrate on tech just where</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:33.090" style="s2">my mind goes clearly we can&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.290" end="00:31:34.980" style="s2">right now take six months you know to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.090" end="00:31:36.510" style="s2">make it but like it&#39;s feasible to make</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.980" end="00:31:38.550" style="s2">it right now I&#39;m not relying on some</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.510" end="00:31:40.230" style="s2">technology that doesn&#39;t exist yet or</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.550" end="00:31:42.630" style="s2">some capacity and human nature that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.230" end="00:31:44.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist yet it&#39;s just can we find</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.630" end="00:31:46.380" style="s2">10,000 of these people that was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.400" end="00:31:48.510" style="s2">us feel so anyone would like to have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.380" end="00:31:51.480" style="s2">idea on what could be done right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.510" end="00:31:55.230" style="s2">with 10,000 people and $100,000 mental</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.480" end="00:31:56.820" style="s2">health emotional support well more an</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.230" end="00:31:59.370" style="s2">emotional support the mental health I</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.820" end="00:32:01.770" style="s2">mean I that the the notion that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.370" end="00:32:04.050" style="s2">curse it&#39;s nothing new it&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.770" end="00:32:06.150" style="s2">exchange right and so I mean it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.050" end="00:32:08.340" style="s2">apply to all mental health conditions</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.150" end="00:32:10.650" style="s2">but certainly to a lot of them problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.340" end="00:32:12.870" style="s2">you know of loneliness isolation lack of</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:15.570" style="s2">social contact that kind of thing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.870" end="00:32:17.090" style="s2">part of it right and so it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.570" end="00:32:19.590" style="s2">that could be relatively easily</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.090" end="00:32:22.710" style="s2">alleviated on a volunteer basis right</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.590" end="00:32:24.270" style="s2">people volunteering to go around and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.710" end="00:32:25.680" style="s2">know hang out with people go for a drink</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.270" end="00:32:27.240" style="s2">in the pub with them go to the cinema</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.680" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">with and make dinner for them whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.240" end="00:32:33.130" style="s2">it means just that you know a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:35.350" style="s2">hours of actual intimate contact</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.130" end="00:32:37.450" style="s2">that seems to me to be something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.350" end="00:32:41.860" style="s2">would be pretty doable without too much</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.450" end="00:32:44.470" style="s2">effort technology or financial and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.860" end="00:32:46.090" style="s2">I mean you would need a bank of hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.470" end="00:32:47.560" style="s2">even thousands of volunteers right to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.090" end="00:32:48.430" style="s2">cover any appreciable area but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.560" end="00:32:53.740" style="s2">could that could make a real difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.430" end="00:32:55.810" style="s2">quite quickly I would volunteer to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.740" end="00:32:57.310" style="s2">that oh my</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.810" end="00:32:59.020" style="s2">I would totally volunteer to do that as</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.310" end="00:33:01.030" style="s2">well but I&#39;m wondering when I&#39;m in my</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.020" end="00:33:02.620" style="s2">loneliest places when I&#39;m in like right</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.030" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">now I&#39;m like wait everyone&#39;s home why</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.620" end="00:33:05.740" style="s2">aren&#39;t I reaching out to my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:07.780" style="s2">having a conversation of like partly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.740" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">because that&#39;s done via the game be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.780" end="00:33:11.830" style="s2">I&#39;m like I have connection it works but</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.960" style="s2">also it&#39;s not quite the same as like my</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.830" end="00:33:17.590" style="s2">in-person connections that I&#39;m someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.960" end="00:33:19.720" style="s2">should be cultivating would people reach</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.590" end="00:33:21.340" style="s2">out and say yes I need someone to go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.720" end="00:33:22.870" style="s2">the cinema with me because it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.340" end="00:33:24.250" style="s2">that is putting stigma on it whereas if</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.870" end="00:33:25.660" style="s2">we&#39;re all just agree that we need more</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.250" end="00:33:29.860" style="s2">connection in our lives and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.660" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like how do we connect people on a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.860" end="00:33:33.220" style="s2">peer-to-peer basis as opposed I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:33.580" style="s2">volunteering out of the goodness of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.220" end="00:33:36.100" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.580" end="00:33:39.940" style="s2">to be your friend for the day which</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.100" end="00:33:41.950" style="s2">feels to me more like a this would be I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.940" end="00:33:43.720" style="s2">mean I would say been you know but much</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.950" end="00:33:45.520" style="s2">better as an ongoing relationship right</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.720" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">once or twice a week on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.520" end="00:33:49.750" style="s2">kind of thing that much much more like</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:52.090" style="s2">that and yeah it wouldn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.750" end="00:33:53.380" style="s2">reaching out to a specific person we</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.090" end="00:33:55.240" style="s2">would need to do if you if you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.380" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">someone who wanted to help all you do is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.240" end="00:34:00.040" style="s2">register on a on a website or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:01.930" style="s2">somewhere you know and someone in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.040" end="00:34:04.330" style="s2">area would get in touch with you and say</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.930" end="00:34:08.020" style="s2">hi my name&#39;s whatever what are you free</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.330" end="00:34:10.300" style="s2">let&#39;s hang out sounds sounds good I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.020" end="00:34:13.450" style="s2">interested is something like that where</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.300" end="00:34:14.889" style="s2">it&#39;s just saying when let&#39;s say what</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.450" end="00:34:19.980" style="s2">topic you want to talk about so I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.889" end="00:34:22.840" style="s2">that&#39;s more above that&#39;s the word okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.980" end="00:34:25.600" style="s2">structure that helps to like organizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.840" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">something that brings people together in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.600" end="00:34:34.030" style="s2">a way that everyone feels included in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">different I&#39;m just like the example</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.030" end="00:34:38.980" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to mind is when people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:40.780" style="s2">hungry and we send them to a soup</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.980" end="00:34:41.800" style="s2">kitchen right and we&#39;d like give money</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.780" end="00:34:43.659" style="s2">in a soup kitchen and those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.800" end="00:34:45.490" style="s2">volunteers versus like what I do a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.659" end="00:34:46.870" style="s2">cohousing which could be done with</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.490" end="00:34:48.760" style="s2">people of various economic</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.870" end="00:34:51.160" style="s2">status right like it doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.760" end="00:34:54.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve given money and now this is your</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.160" end="00:34:56.580" style="s2">pot of like charity stew right it can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.400" end="00:34:59.260" style="s2">what is it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.580" end="00:35:01.150" style="s2">mutual aid instead of charity I remember</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.260" end="00:35:03.160" style="s2">there was one that like actually rhymes</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.150" end="00:35:04.630" style="s2">like that and I&#39;m not saying what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.160" end="00:35:06.370" style="s2">saying is that but like there&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.630" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">me that&#39;s putting it in that category</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.370" end="00:35:11.980" style="s2">it&#39;s then hard for me to wrap it around</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.080" end="00:35:13.870" style="s2">of like that&#39;s fine that&#39;s where we want</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.980" end="00:35:14.920" style="s2">to go from it is mutual aid though right</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.870" end="00:35:17.680" style="s2">because the person doing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.920" end="00:35:19.990" style="s2">volunteering and doing the helping get</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.680" end="00:35:21.820" style="s2">something very real and very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.990" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">out of it also right I mean it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.820" end="00:35:28.510" style="s2">isn&#39;t it is not one-way traffic what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:30.610" style="s2">guys heard me talk before about like</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.510" end="00:35:33.820" style="s2">kind of the 12-step model and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.610" end="00:35:36.040" style="s2">there&#39;s something different in that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.820" end="00:35:38.640" style="s2">know you&#39;re going and saying okay I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.040" end="00:35:41.170" style="s2">an issue you know I go to this place and</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.640" end="00:35:44.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a you see you&#39;re saying I have</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.170" end="00:35:45.190" style="s2">this this issue and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.050" end="00:35:48.640" style="s2">bunch of other people who have that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.190" end="00:35:54.520" style="s2">there who have that issue and although</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.640" end="00:35:56.980" style="s2">there is a bit of the I&#39;m I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.520" end="00:36:01.660" style="s2">know I need help and there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.980" end="00:36:04.300" style="s2">there to help it isn&#39;t it sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.660" end="00:36:06.910" style="s2">diffused in a way that I think I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.300" end="00:36:09.910" style="s2">a similar response to Jubilee to Eric</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.910" end="00:36:11.430" style="s2">your suggestion I like I like that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.910" end="00:36:16.470" style="s2">there would there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.430" end="00:36:19.450" style="s2">like yeah that the I mean people have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.470" end="00:36:21.880" style="s2">one of the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.450" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">happens with the 12-step is like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.880" end="00:36:26.530" style="s2">have to be really really hurting to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:31.360" style="s2">able to say I need help to go to this</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.530" end="00:36:32.860" style="s2">thing and so how do we create an</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.360" end="00:36:35.880" style="s2">environment where you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.860" end="00:36:41.110" style="s2">hurting quite so much to say I need help</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.880" end="00:36:43.960" style="s2">how to end and yeah and that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.110" end="00:36:45.820" style="s2">even asking for help is a step towards</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.960" end="00:36:47.770" style="s2">like oh I have to acknowledge that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.820" end="00:36:49.930" style="s2">lonely and I think loneliness is so</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.770" end="00:36:52.420" style="s2">rampant in society that it&#39;s been normal</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.930" end="00:36:53.380" style="s2">as opposed like you&#39;re maybe with people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.420" end="00:36:55.630" style="s2">but you&#39;re still lonely</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.380" end="00:36:58.060" style="s2">as opposed to creating things that give</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.630" end="00:37:00.580" style="s2">us connection without you needing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.060" end="00:37:02.410" style="s2">first say that you&#39;re lonely because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.580" end="00:37:03.700" style="s2">a lot of vulnerability that goes within</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.410" end="00:37:05.890" style="s2">that and reaching up for help and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.700" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">there&#39;s even more that then when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.890" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">don&#39;t get that help it feels so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.390" end="00:37:12.580" style="s2">worse than having not asked in the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:15.340" style="s2">place and I like the ABE so that the a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.580" end="00:37:16.540" style="s2">model of like one everyone kind of shows</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.340" end="00:37:18.700" style="s2">up and they&#39;re equal even whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.540" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">they&#39;re one day or thirty thirty years</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.700" end="00:37:22.870" style="s2">sober but at the same time there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:25.750" style="s2">other structure of finding a sponsor</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.870" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">that&#39;s and so having something where it</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.750" end="00:37:30.760" style="s2">is more of a common base and then you if</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:32.110" style="s2">you feel you need more and you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.760" end="00:37:34.540" style="s2">the people who can be like listen I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.110" end="00:37:38.860" style="s2">lonely I need more there&#39;s tools for you</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.540" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s more designed broadly for to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.860" end="00:37:43.600" style="s2">increase everyone&#39;s connection right</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:47.590" style="s2">everyone who is my people helping you</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.600" end="00:37:49.180" style="s2">move in that direction in my ideal a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.590" end="00:37:51.130" style="s2">flat budget you know if we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.180" end="00:37:55.000" style="s2">about what can we do now is you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.130" end="00:37:58.270" style="s2">10,000 people and $100,000 the I was</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.000" end="00:37:59.830" style="s2">reminded something that somebody did a</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.270" end="00:38:03.060" style="s2">couple years ago there was a hash tag</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.830" end="00:38:05.500" style="s2">that said what anxiety feels like and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.060" end="00:38:07.780" style="s2">like a whole lot of people started</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.500" end="00:38:09.880" style="s2">posting like what anxiety felt like for</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.780" end="00:38:12.940" style="s2">them and what would it look like if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.880" end="00:38:15.700" style="s2">had ten thousand people who posted what</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.940" end="00:38:17.500" style="s2">loneliness feels like to me and made it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.700" end="00:38:22.300" style="s2">something where we&#39;re we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.500" end="00:38:24.100" style="s2">about it on you know in our social you</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.300" end="00:38:26.170" style="s2">know in our social groups and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.100" end="00:38:28.810" style="s2">describing that and and then you know be</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.170" end="00:38:31.150" style="s2">at the bottom saying if you feel similar</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.810" end="00:38:33.370" style="s2">reach out to me making yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.150" end="00:38:35.560" style="s2">available so having 10,000 people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.370" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">are making themselves available to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.560" end="00:38:40.360" style="s2">hey I&#39;ve had this is how what loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:40.990" style="s2">is felt like to me if this sounds</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.360" end="00:38:43.500" style="s2">familiar</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.990" end="00:38:43.500" style="s2">let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.609" end="00:38:52.529" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t take $100,000 maybe but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.729" end="00:38:55.019" style="s2">finding the 10,000 right it&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.529" end="00:38:56.729" style="s2">you still got saying you still finding</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.019" end="00:38:58.380" style="s2">10,000 people who are willing to admit</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.729" end="00:38:59.880" style="s2">to themselves that they want to enter</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.380" end="00:39:02.609" style="s2">into this kind of arena right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:03.869" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty much the same you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.609" end="00:39:07.019" style="s2">the same issue that you brought up</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.019" end="00:39:11.489" style="s2">having to having to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.999" end="00:39:14.339" style="s2">thing and step up to a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.489" end="00:39:16.410" style="s2">are looking for help right yeah is there</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.339" end="00:39:19.140" style="s2">a difference though between looking back</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.410" end="00:39:21.599" style="s2">and saying here&#39;s what I felt when I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.140" end="00:39:24.569" style="s2">been lonely versus reaching out when</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.599" end="00:39:26.579" style="s2">you&#39;re in loneliness right I think we</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.569" end="00:39:28.140" style="s2">can all admit to having been lonely but</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.579" end="00:39:29.190" style="s2">it&#39;s harder in the moment to be like</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.140" end="00:39:30.779" style="s2">unloved</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.190" end="00:39:32.219" style="s2">come play with me which of course is</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.779" end="00:39:35.009" style="s2">impossible right now but you think</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.219" end="00:39:37.140" style="s2">there&#39;s still ways yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.009" end="00:39:39.779" style="s2">distinction of you know it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.140" end="00:39:42.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be I feel lonely right</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.779" end="00:39:44.640" style="s2">now it&#39;s this is what loneliness has</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:46.499" style="s2">felt like to you know that you know this</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.640" end="00:39:48.989" style="s2">is what lonely feels like it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.499" end="00:39:50.670" style="s2">something that I have felt I may not be</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.989" end="00:39:53.729" style="s2">feeling that right now but I have felt</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.670" end="00:39:56.069" style="s2">it and so then because it is much easier</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.729" end="00:39:59.519" style="s2">to empathize with someone if you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.069" end="00:40:01.799" style="s2">actually experienced it yeah and so if</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.519" end="00:40:03.719" style="s2">somebody shares what it felt like to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.799" end="00:40:06.539" style="s2">them and somebody goes oh that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.719" end="00:40:08.339" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling right now so it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.539" end="00:40:12.209" style="s2">people who are willing to admit oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.339" end="00:40:13.979" style="s2">I have felt loneliness yeah okay so how</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.209" end="00:40:16.170" style="s2">is a Facebook group not the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.979" end="00:40:18.059" style="s2">vehicle for this then yeah a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.170" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">group you know he started off i-i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.059" end="00:40:22.380" style="s2">felt really lonely today blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.150" style="s2">anyone else felt lonely and get it going</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.380" end="00:40:25.949" style="s2">on a phase break that sounds to me like</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.150" end="00:40:27.449" style="s2">the perfect vehicle for this otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.949" end="00:40:29.069" style="s2">you&#39;re starting a website I&#39;m lonely</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.449" end="00:40:30.989" style="s2">calm or whatever asking people to come</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.069" end="00:40:32.609" style="s2">and relate their experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.989" end="00:40:34.559" style="s2">loneliness and creating an environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.609" end="00:40:36.449" style="s2">where I mean I understand once people</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.559" end="00:40:38.069" style="s2">are in that environment I completely get</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.449" end="00:40:39.900" style="s2">the point of the shared experience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.069" end="00:40:41.640" style="s2">a much safer feel to the whole thing I</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.900" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">completely understand all of that but</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.640" end="00:40:46.829" style="s2">it&#39;s still the the moment of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:49.229" style="s2">into that environment whether it is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.829" end="00:40:51.269" style="s2">exchange of you know those volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.229" end="00:40:54.900" style="s2">and people that need help or whether it</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.269" end="00:40:56.759" style="s2">is a communal space for people who have</p>

<p begin="00:47:50.720" end="00:47:58.799" style="s2">so Jubilee what came up for me and what</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.809" end="00:48:02.609" style="s2">I like your questions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.799" end="00:48:06.180" style="s2">something as someone who in my darkest</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.779" end="00:48:14.670" style="s2">my purpose sometimes the only thing I</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.809" end="00:48:17.819" style="s2">could figure out is okay what am i</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.670" end="00:48:19.829" style="s2">working on next what&#39;s the next what you</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.609" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">12-step they talk about what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.470" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">right thing I couldn&#39;t handle that</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:30.119" style="s2">because I&#39;m too much of a perfectionist</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.190" style="s2">I freaked out when they asked that so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.119" end="00:48:34.680" style="s2">said so I could handle what&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.190" end="00:48:36.569" style="s2">indicated action like what&#39;s my next</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.680" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">indicated thing because if you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.569" end="00:48:42.029" style="s2">that like because I know that when I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:44.579" style="s2">in that darkest place if somebody asked</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.029" end="00:48:48.539" style="s2">what my purpose was I would flip out and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.579" end="00:48:51.059" style="s2">and not - and like I like that now from</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.539" end="00:48:54.839" style="s2">where I&#39;m at I absolutely like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.059" end="00:48:59.640" style="s2">question but in that place that question</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.839" end="00:49:02.250" style="s2">was too overwhelming for me and so what</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.640" end="00:49:05.880" style="s2">would be a slight variation like to meet</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.250" end="00:49:09.210" style="s2">somebody where they&#39;re at with that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.880" end="00:49:11.910" style="s2">know like because those are those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.210" end="00:49:14.910" style="s2">awesome questions and if you are barely</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.029" end="00:49:25.289" style="s2">and I love Eric&#39;s thing of you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.700" end="00:49:26.880" style="s2">still that in the education system so</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.289" end="00:49:28.799" style="s2">that you know it from you know like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.880" end="00:49:32.309" style="s2">you&#39;re asking yourself that from you</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.799" end="00:49:35.789" style="s2">know kindergarten but you haven&#39;t don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.789" end="00:49:40.049" style="s2">when I look at the most questions what</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.740" end="00:49:41.670" style="s2">is your purpose is like a verb what do</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.049" end="00:49:43.319" style="s2">you want to physically be doing and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.670" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">could be take a shower and it could be</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.319" end="00:49:47.460" style="s2">but I get what you&#39;re saying the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">grandiose nests of it is itself kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.460" end="00:49:49.809" style="s2">a barrier</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:52.599" style="s2">is that like what&#39;s the perfect thing to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.809" end="00:49:53.950" style="s2">do as opposed to what is an action you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.599" end="00:49:56.230" style="s2">can take that would help about swear I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.950" end="00:49:58.210" style="s2">liked the idea of a purpose goal because</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.230" end="00:50:00.220" style="s2">that that is already the purpose without</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.210" end="00:50:02.140" style="s2">you need to ask it right it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.220" end="00:50:04.869" style="s2">behind the scenes these questions are</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.140" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">getting answered but the technology is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.869" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">just connecting you to it to a verb a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:12.099" style="s2">thing you&#39;re doing a goal with people</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:13.329" style="s2">who have a similar goal and in so doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.099" end="00:50:15.609" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find out more about</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.329" end="00:50:18.309" style="s2">yourself and the resource is to be able</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.609" end="00:50:21.579" style="s2">to do that so it&#39;s like it&#39;s the me the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.309" end="00:50:24.069" style="s2">group the verb and the things I need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.579" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">do any of those three right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.069" end="00:50:30.040" style="s2">and to live my life so I can do any of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:32.410" style="s2">them as well but I like yes a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.040" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">wording than purpose is probably well no</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.410" end="00:50:35.349" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a question of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.760" end="00:50:37.270" style="s2">remembering that it said that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.349" end="00:50:38.410" style="s2">iterative cycle right and so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.270" end="00:50:40.839" style="s2">asking yourself what is my purpose</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.410" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">notice what is my grand you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.839" end="00:50:44.589" style="s2">my Dharma you know what I mean it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.230" end="00:50:57.369" style="s2">great but I mean it needn&#39;t be that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.420" end="00:51:00.329" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s going on all the time all</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:30.630" style="s2">stigma associated with it and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.329" end="00:51:33.130" style="s2">lot of what can help with that is</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.510" end="00:52:02.069" style="s2">hardest to find them being able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.220" end="00:52:04.170" style="s2">actually because because as</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.069" end="00:52:05.579" style="s2">I feel like it&#39;s a different level than</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.170" end="00:52:07.140" style="s2">the lowliness if like you have to admit</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.769" end="00:52:16.609" style="s2">something that can have a devastating</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.609" end="00:52:18.930" style="s2">impact on your life as they all do</p>

<p begin="00:52:29.309" end="00:52:32.519" style="s2">do that in both instances if I got</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.289" end="00:52:33.720" style="s2">diagnosed or something I would love to</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.609" end="00:52:38.910" style="s2">of the diagnoses I&#39;ve had that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.259" end="00:52:41.369" style="s2">dealt with and then you also know that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.910" end="00:52:44.430" style="s2">it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not the spokesperson</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.369" end="00:52:45.599" style="s2">for acoustic neuromas but I&#39;m one person</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.430" end="00:52:47.910" style="s2">who&#39;s been through it and here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.599" end="00:52:50.759" style="s2">experience well and then there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.910" end="00:52:55.920" style="s2">interesting variation of that which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.759" end="00:52:58.289" style="s2">you know the you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.920" end="00:53:00.809" style="s2">different ways of addressing certain</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.289" end="00:53:02.430" style="s2">things you know I have one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.809" end="00:53:04.529" style="s2">12-step groups that I&#39;m involved in is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.430" end="00:53:06.690" style="s2">ACA adult children of alcoholics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.529" end="00:53:11.430" style="s2">dysfunctional families everyone in those</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.690" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">groups or I would say 99% of them are</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.430" end="00:53:17.700" style="s2">dealing with complex PTSD that they and</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:19.769" style="s2">so like but there&#39;s this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.700" end="00:53:22.499" style="s2">thing of helpings that we you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.769" end="00:53:25.259" style="s2">like okay well I have complex PTSD and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.499" end="00:53:27.390" style="s2">then there&#39;s options but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.259" end="00:53:29.789" style="s2">complexity in terms of how people might</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.390" end="00:53:33.059" style="s2">how people might feel in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.789" end="00:53:37.859" style="s2">this group that&#39;s it&#39;s like wait a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.059" end="00:53:41.549" style="s2">minute what&#39;s this and you know so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.859" end="00:53:44.039" style="s2">but again in the you know in being able</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.549" end="00:53:46.920" style="s2">to talk about it and normalize it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.039" end="00:53:49.799" style="s2">say yeah this is my this is this is my</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.920" end="00:53:53.930" style="s2">experience and there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.799" end="00:53:56.549" style="s2">interesting thing of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.930" end="00:53:59.180" style="s2">that there&#39;s because there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.549" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">stages because there&#39;s people who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.180" end="00:54:03.059" style="s2">realizing oh wait a minute I have</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:05.880" style="s2">anxiety I have bipolar I have whatever</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.059" end="00:54:08.730" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some people who have</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">been on medication for years haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.730" end="00:54:12.749" style="s2">found any solutions and I realize it</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">quick wait a minute this isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.749" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.200" end="00:54:20.220" style="s2">that model isn&#39;t working for me and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.020" end="00:54:22.110" style="s2">figuring out something you know figuring</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.220" end="00:54:25.590" style="s2">out something else that includes the art</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.110" end="00:54:29.580" style="s2">the this the that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.590" end="00:54:35.490" style="s2">meditation art the exercise the you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.580" end="00:54:37.470" style="s2">all those different pieces yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.490" end="00:54:41.010" style="s2">one of the things that we is a potential</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.470" end="00:54:43.530" style="s2">solution for 10,000 and 100,000 is a</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.010" end="00:54:47.940" style="s2">database of options without critiquing</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.530" end="00:54:49.890" style="s2">them necessarily what are how do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.940" end="00:54:51.690" style="s2">reduce your anxiety how do you you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.890" end="00:54:54.180" style="s2">like for me I know meditation works well</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.690" end="00:54:55.710" style="s2">for other people there&#39;s like to my</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.180" end="00:54:57.570" style="s2">thoughts is the worst thing ever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.710" end="00:54:59.610" style="s2">not about because most things out there</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.570" end="00:55:01.590" style="s2">like a one-size-fits-all take vitamin D</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.610" end="00:55:04.080" style="s2">it solves everything take iron insults</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.590" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">everything as opposed to hey I had this</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.080" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">and when I started taking iron turns out</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:09.810" style="s2">I had energy like just and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:14.520" style="s2">more mental health some more like</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.810" end="00:55:16.110" style="s2">meditation yoga tai chi a like any</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.520" end="00:55:17.610" style="s2">literally anything that can fit under</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.110" end="00:55:21.000" style="s2">that umbrella what are the pros what are</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.610" end="00:55:22.620" style="s2">the cons which ones are gonna I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.000" end="00:55:24.450" style="s2">respond to you the best and that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.620" end="00:55:25.710" style="s2">more than a database and probably more</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.450" end="00:55:33.470" style="s2">than hundred thousand dollars but a</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.710" end="00:55:35.730" style="s2">database itself could be well and and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.470" end="00:55:37.230" style="s2">and this is one that we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.730" end="00:55:39.480" style="s2">talked about and this kind of actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.230" end="00:55:41.070" style="s2">goes back a section a little bit this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.480" end="00:55:42.960" style="s2">just a thought that occurred to me one</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.070" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">of the fun one of the things I have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.960" end="00:55:50.460" style="s2">really hard time with is you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:53.400" style="s2">anxiety there&#39;s a very big difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.460" end="00:55:56.130" style="s2">between I&#39;m experiencing anxiety and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.400" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">have anxiety anxiety something that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.130" end="00:55:59.640" style="s2">have that you have to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">experiencing is something that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.640" end="00:56:06.750" style="s2">moving through and right now what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:08.820" style="s2">have is a the dsm-5 you know they had</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.750" end="00:56:11.010" style="s2">there&#39;s this giant book of disorders</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.820" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">that people might have and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.010" end="00:56:14.670" style="s2">put this thing on you and say this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">what you have and you&#39;re stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.670" end="00:56:18.960" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck with it whereas there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:20.580" style="s2">something like it might be a page that</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.960" end="00:56:24.150" style="s2">you&#39;re going things that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.580" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">through and so how do you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.150" end="00:56:28.560" style="s2">that goes back a step but it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:30.790" style="s2">part that occurred to me</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.560" end="00:56:32.890" style="s2">we only have a few more minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.790" end="00:56:37.570" style="s2">Shiloh would you like to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.890" end="00:56:40.270" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been are we is it closing</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.570" end="00:56:42.670" style="s2">we have just four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.270" end="00:56:43.810" style="s2">ot - but I mean if you have something</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.670" end="00:56:48.670" style="s2">you want to say if it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.810" end="00:56:52.060" style="s2">closing umbrella you I guess it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.670" end="00:56:53.500" style="s2">topic but it&#39;s also not if I had ten</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.060" end="00:56:56.340" style="s2">thousand people in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.500" end="00:57:00.730" style="s2">dollars I think that I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.340" end="00:57:03.730" style="s2">develop this multi-level value system</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.730" end="00:57:07.120" style="s2">just the technology of it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.730" end="00:57:09.340" style="s2">would want to go to communities and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.120" end="00:57:12.850" style="s2">introduce it to them through like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.340" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">workshop of art of course because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.850" end="00:57:18.220" style="s2">who I am but other people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">different solutions and share with them</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.220" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2">how by anchoring ourselves to our</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:31.180" style="s2">location and each other we can grow this</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:33.610" style="s2">better system so that would be my way I</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.180" end="00:57:36.190" style="s2">guess of actually attracting more people</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.610" end="00:57:37.750" style="s2">would be because they&#39;re giving them</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.190" end="00:57:39.820" style="s2">this gift in a community where they can</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.750" end="00:57:42.820" style="s2">value each other themselves their land</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.820" end="00:57:47.170" style="s2">it gives a real sense of wealth and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.820" end="00:57:50.920" style="s2">believe that by including everyone it</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.170" end="00:57:52.810" style="s2">gives us a way out of our mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.920" end="00:57:54.340" style="s2">like you&#39;re saying maybe it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.810" end="00:57:56.740" style="s2">phase we&#39;re trying to work through some</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.340" end="00:57:58.930" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t working so I feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.740" end="00:58:02.770" style="s2">like that&#39;s a way because for me when</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.930" end="00:58:06.040" style="s2">I&#39;m at my worst points I have to find a</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.770" end="00:58:07.750" style="s2">way out through the future through what</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.040" end="00:58:10.090" style="s2">I can do in the moment at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.750" end="00:58:12.840" style="s2">so working towards there but starting</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.090" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">here anyway I guess that&#39;s what I would</p>
