<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.830" style="s2">so today we&#39;re gonna to see something</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.100" end="00:00:07.080" style="s2">new which is editing I was not able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.830" end="00:00:08.880" style="s2">get this one done in a single take so in</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:10.830" style="s2">addition to my ordinary low audio</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.880" end="00:00:12.599" style="s2">quality and I suppose also my relatively</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.830" end="00:00:15.420" style="s2">low video quality we&#39;re gonna get a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">chance to see we try my hand at editing</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.420" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">which I&#39;m imagine also could be</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:23.220" style="s2">relatively poor so let&#39;s just let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:27.740" style="s2">that earnestness and low five perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.220" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">equates to integrity and we see the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.740" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">production value suddenly skyrocket i I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:35.809" style="s2">hope you have the appropriate level of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">cynicism alright so on to the content</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.809" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">but I wanted us I want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:43.050" style="s2">think three things all of which are</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:46.289" style="s2">roughly bucketed under the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.050" end="00:00:48.320" style="s2">the operating methodology of the city of</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">how is this thing going to happen and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.320" end="00:00:56.039" style="s2">the three things broadly speaking are</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:01:01.320" style="s2">its fundamental design for emergence the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.039" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">the nature of the team who and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.320" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">question of how does it enter into</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">relationship with the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">the outside world or at least one aspect</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">of that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">alright so bucket number one the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">fundamental operating methodology</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">designing for emergence so you know we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:20.030" style="s2">know we&#39;re dealing with something which</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:24.689" style="s2">which must fundamentally be autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.030" end="00:01:26.670" style="s2">we cannot now even meaningfully hope to</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.689" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">design it and this is not that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.670" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">an object you cannot be a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">system it has to be intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">complex which means it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">intrinsically become and with is many</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:39.720" style="s2">ways going to be quite surprising so</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">let&#39;s use the metaphor of the developing</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.720" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">embryo okay way to get to an embryo you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:47.869" style="s2">need a couple of core ingredients first</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.860" style="s2">you need an egg second you need a sperm</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.869" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">this egg in the sperm have to come</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.860" end="00:01:54.180" style="s2">together in the right way that the DNA</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:57.000" style="s2">has to has to merge and has to provide</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.180" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2">the right kind of framework to steward</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:01.950" style="s2">the autopoietic process of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">nutrients into now I developed an</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.950" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">organism then then you have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">ability to take that that a which is now</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:12.390" style="s2">potent and embed it into into a room and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.739" style="s2">into a context that can provide it with</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:15.989" style="s2">those nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.739" end="00:02:18.689" style="s2">to then allow how to put a process to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.989" end="00:02:20.909" style="s2">actually to go into the world by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.689" end="00:02:23.219" style="s2">that wound will also need to be embedded</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.909" end="00:02:24.750" style="s2">into the context of a mother who can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.219" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">in a relationship with the larger world</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.750" end="00:02:29.909" style="s2">and bring those resources into the womb</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">which then brings it into the zygote</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.909" end="00:02:34.489" style="s2">which eventually becomes an embryo okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the metaphor and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.489" end="00:02:39.150" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing all right so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">behind psyllium is to say okay do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.150" end="00:02:44.569" style="s2">have the right DNA do we have the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.919" style="s2">design criteria do we have the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.569" end="00:02:49.079" style="s2">decode and do we really understand where</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.919" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">the necessary ingredients the necessary</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.079" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">and sufficient conditions to begin the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:02:57.000" style="s2">process to enable this thing to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:03:00.629" style="s2">forward and then when we talk about say</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.000" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">for example the the womb I think largely</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.629" end="00:03:05.069" style="s2">this is going to be the who the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">who come in the capacity that they bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.069" end="00:03:09.569" style="s2">the resources that they bring the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:11.969" style="s2">history that they bring and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.569" end="00:03:15.329" style="s2">space that they establish to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.969" end="00:03:17.099" style="s2">allow in and among themselves and and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.329" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">the larger world that is now I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.099" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">going to be contemplating this question</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:24.389" style="s2">the emergent possibility obsidium was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:26.280" style="s2">lot of failure a lot of failing is going</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.389" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">to happen and can they weather that</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.280" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">storm and grow into it and then kids</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:32.340" style="s2">other groups come in and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">people in some sense are simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">the the core nutrient you know as people</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">are attracted into this and then bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:41.340" style="s2">their capacity they increase the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:46.259" style="s2">capacity of the whole to become what it</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.340" end="00:03:48.750" style="s2">is and also are in some sense the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.259" end="00:03:52.769" style="s2">context that are to create the space for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.750" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">it to be able to to develop and then and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.769" end="00:03:55.919" style="s2">then we actually finally in in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">fundamental sense have the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.919" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">with the outside world all right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:01.079" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about those two</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">components the WHO and particular some</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.079" end="00:04:04.530" style="s2">of the characteristics are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:08.729" style="s2">sensibility of the zeitgeist of the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.530" end="00:04:09.900" style="s2">initial who the node 0 cohort and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.729" end="00:04:12.509" style="s2">also how does this thing come into</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.900" end="00:04:14.250" style="s2">relationship with larger world the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.509" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">people who are in fact forming the city</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.250" end="00:04:18.599" style="s2">mean beginnings node 0 was what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:20.789" style="s2">calling it will obviously have to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.599" end="00:04:22.889" style="s2">coming in extremely mindful of this of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.789" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">this reality alright so this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.889" end="00:04:26.620" style="s2">is a startup mindset the notion is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:28.510" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.620" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">for example to create an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.510" end="00:04:33.010" style="s2">community which has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:35.139" style="s2">insularity to it right the idea is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.010" end="00:04:37.210" style="s2">to to go to coach Reiki and sort of hang</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.139" end="00:04:40.180" style="s2">out with each other for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.210" end="00:04:41.470" style="s2">decades and hope things are cool the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:44.729" style="s2">intent is to create something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.470" end="00:04:47.050" style="s2">ultimately at the end of the are</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.729" end="00:04:50.169" style="s2">effectively everybody on the planet has</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.050" end="00:04:53.500" style="s2">chosen to participate in so it has a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.169" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">of that five - it&#39;s a vibe of creation</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.500" end="00:04:58.389" style="s2">it&#39;s a vibe of innovation right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:05:00.460" style="s2">vibe of working really hard with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.389" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">essence of note zero to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.460" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:08.740" style="s2">living &#39;no Slyke human again and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:11.070" style="s2">the exploration of how the autopoietic</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.740" end="00:05:13.720" style="s2">process of sodium can be furthered</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.070" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">maximally so it&#39;s that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.720" end="00:05:19.240" style="s2">sensibility so think of it a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">like a Mars expedition right the startup</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.240" end="00:05:24.970" style="s2">crew of note zero is going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">come with a lot of mojo and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.970" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">commitment to doing to building</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:33.099" style="s2">something to building something that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:35.530" style="s2">hard to build and with a lot of novelty</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.099" end="00:05:38.349" style="s2">a lot of exploration in what Canon can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.530" end="00:05:42.039" style="s2">be done then the the last characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.349" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">which i think is rather important is we</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.039" end="00:05:46.599" style="s2">talked about the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:48.190" style="s2">requirement of the sieve &#39;i&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.599" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">relationship with this exterior which</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.190" end="00:05:52.169" style="s2">you say the rest of the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.169" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">necessity certainly the beginning in</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.169" end="00:05:57.220" style="s2">probably for quite some long period of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:59.020" style="s2">time maybe even generations of being</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.220" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">able to pull resources from the outside</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.020" end="00:06:02.910" style="s2">world into this idiom well you might</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:05.229" style="s2">think of that it&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.910" end="00:06:08.650" style="s2">balance of trade it was the way a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.229" end="00:06:09.940" style="s2">nation-state operates and if the well</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.650" end="00:06:12.970" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t necessarily work that much</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.940" end="00:06:14.410" style="s2">these days but caught a decade ago or as</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.970" end="00:06:17.080" style="s2">it&#39;s called four decades ago if the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.410" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">united states wanted to import cars from</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.080" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">japan then the united states needed to</p>
