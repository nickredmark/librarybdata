<p begin="00:03:04.230" end="00:03:10.620" style="s2">really good pieces of drama like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">Star Wars movies or et where there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">structure to the story and there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">that the characters are formed there&#39;s a</p>
