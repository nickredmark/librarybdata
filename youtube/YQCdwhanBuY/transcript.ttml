<p begin="00:00:22.710" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">distinct questions there one was what do</p>

<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:27.980" style="s2">would you prefer</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.090" end="00:00:36.160" style="s2">oh forget the loss all right all right I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.780" end="00:00:42.070" style="s2">think I mentioned this in a different</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.160" end="00:00:43.750" style="s2">venue and but I&#39;ll put it this way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.070" end="00:00:46.600" style="s2">noticing that my hairstyle is vectoring</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.750" end="00:00:49.809" style="s2">directly into the American Revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.600" end="00:00:51.339" style="s2">by pretty soon I&#39;m gonna have a Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.809" end="00:00:52.629" style="s2">Jefferson bow in my hair just because</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.339" end="00:00:54.070" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be necessary I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.629" end="00:00:55.809" style="s2">everybody&#39;s going in that direction step</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.070" end="00:01:03.040" style="s2">Alexander minor is going more than one</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.809" end="00:01:06.490" style="s2">standing direction so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.040" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">I think is a kind of a primary</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.490" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">opportunity right now it&#39;s simply like</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">growing up maybe or stepping into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:23.380" style="s2">how do I say this</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:25.000" style="s2">all right maybe I&#39;ll say it this way</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.380" end="00:01:26.290" style="s2">this is just just a frame but you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.000" end="00:01:27.729" style="s2">you can do this across a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.290" end="00:01:28.960" style="s2">different dimensions so this frame is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.729" end="00:01:30.970" style="s2">that hopefully this frame lands I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.960" end="00:01:33.670" style="s2">done it before and I think I think it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.970" end="00:01:36.310" style="s2">worked out pretty well so one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.670" end="00:01:38.020" style="s2">of the the things that I&#39;ve discovered</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.310" end="00:01:39.880" style="s2">or at least I&#39;ve noticed is that human</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.020" end="00:01:42.219" style="s2">beings have I think very distinctive</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.880" end="00:01:45.460" style="s2">elemental stages in our lives there</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.219" end="00:01:47.079" style="s2">really is a difference between childhood</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.460" end="00:01:48.729" style="s2">adolescence young adulthood mature</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.079" end="00:01:50.530" style="s2">adulthood an elder hood are there just</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.729" end="00:01:52.569" style="s2">different stages neurologically</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.530" end="00:01:54.369" style="s2">physiologically all of it all the way</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.569" end="00:01:55.990" style="s2">down as you&#39;re talking to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.369" end="00:01:57.789" style="s2">yesterday was give me a deep dive on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.990" end="00:01:59.469" style="s2">actual neurological changes that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.789" end="00:02:02.829" style="s2">happened in men in their early 50s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.469" end="00:02:05.109" style="s2">a real thing all right so that&#39;s one and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.829" end="00:02:07.240" style="s2">then too we could talk about the notion</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.109" end="00:02:09.729" style="s2">of their deep being different in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.240" end="00:02:11.800" style="s2">Chronos Kairos there are different</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.729" end="00:02:14.709" style="s2">states of the context that we find</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.800" end="00:02:16.150" style="s2">ourselves in and the hypothesis that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.709" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">would put forward and I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.150" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">really matter too much whether my</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:20.530" style="s2">hypothesis is any good but use it as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">as a way of thinking through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.530" end="00:02:24.220" style="s2">question that you&#39;re asking this is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">way of of creating a model that helps</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.220" end="00:02:28.410" style="s2">anchor that is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:33.820" style="s2">things are good I think Dave actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">sent me that message I this bad times</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.820" end="00:02:39.580" style="s2">creates strong then that one something</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:41.560" style="s2">on that so during good times there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.580" end="00:02:42.430" style="s2">things that can be done and should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.560" end="00:02:45.670" style="s2">done by people at different</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.430" end="00:02:47.650" style="s2">developmental stages but during bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.670" end="00:02:49.740" style="s2">times there&#39;s a transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.650" end="00:02:53.530" style="s2">needs to occur that there needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.740" end="00:02:56.740" style="s2">different capacity or identity we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.530" end="00:02:59.950" style="s2">different things so for example in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.740" end="00:03:05.830" style="s2">case what I would say concretely is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.950" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">the the elders really really need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.830" end="00:03:10.960" style="s2">step into elder hood for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:12.310" style="s2">in our live so I don&#39;t mean nearly</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.960" end="00:03:14.260" style="s2">people who happen to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.310" end="00:03:15.550" style="s2">calendar years on their on their</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.260" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">biography you&#39;ve been around the Sun a</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.550" end="00:03:19.600" style="s2">bunch of times I mean people who have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:21.250" style="s2">actually lived life and remember things</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.600" end="00:03:23.380" style="s2">like they remember when people actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.250" end="00:03:25.630" style="s2">used to sort of do things for the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.380" end="00:03:27.790" style="s2">reason when people thought that lying</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.630" end="00:03:29.800" style="s2">was shameful when people knew their</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:31.090" style="s2">neighbors and cared for their neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.800" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">like they have an invited experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.090" end="00:03:35.080" style="s2">that the things that we need to actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:36.910" style="s2">relearn pretty quickly and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:38.500" style="s2">actually lived first person and they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.910" end="00:03:40.540" style="s2">share their first-person experiences of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.500" end="00:03:42.610" style="s2">what meaningfulness actually is over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.540" end="00:03:43.989" style="s2">long arc and I think I said this</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.610" end="00:03:48.430" style="s2">previously I don&#39;t care that much about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.989" end="00:03:51.580" style="s2">the the stuff you know about the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.430" end="00:03:52.840" style="s2">we do it&#39;s it&#39;s okay I&#39;m it&#39;s cool I</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.580" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">really like the fact that you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.840" end="00:03:58.060" style="s2">really deep learned experience about how</p>
