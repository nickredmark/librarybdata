<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">yeah the one great thing about the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">protests are organized in the states</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">um is that we get a lot of feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">how things are organized</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">um people are you know constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">writing about it tweeting about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">posting about it and this uh article is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">pretty well written</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">and um it goes over the tactics and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">thinking associated with the protest</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">you know from an insider&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">somebody who is trying to escalate</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">the situation and um it goes over some</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">core elements uh you know breaking uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:52.560" style="s2">the protest into different</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">groups of expertise you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.560" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">focus on medical support people who scan</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">outside media or telegram or</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">airdrop to get information into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">protests and then back out</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">and then the uh the role of the peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:11.040" style="s2">protesters the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">there to uh protest non-violently</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">who tend to be the the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">the people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:18.640" style="s2">protesting he even uh you know talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">about how the looters fit into the whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.640" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">overall equation</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">so um the interesting thing is is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">he thought about how they interacted one</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">thing in particular was</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">what he saw the reversal of the roles i</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">assume it&#39;s a he</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">might not be reversal of the roles of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">non-violent protesters and the activists</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:41.599" style="s2">are you know people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">more kinetically focused uh in previous</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">protests in hong kong for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">kinetic protesters</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">were the ones who were protecting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">non-violent protesters from</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">police encroachment uh you know police</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.000" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">uh being pushed back being</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">driven from the field and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">in this protest due to the volume and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.120" style="s2">largely due to the nature of the protest</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">he didn&#39;t mention this because it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.120" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">about police violence</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">uh and that the police were put on it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">into a defensive crouch</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">and were trying to de-escalate rather</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">than engage</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">on the whole in all of the thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">protests that went on</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">globally is that the non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">protesters were</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">extremely numerous and they were at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">forefront and that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">provided the cover for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">kinetic protesters usually people who</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">are uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">using ballistics meaning you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">throwing water bottles or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">or rocks or or any kind of object at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">police to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">you know prompt them into action and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">the non-violent protesters were the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">shield because the police weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">willing to</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">barrel into them and engage with them</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">and that created</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">an interesting dynamic in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.960" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">kinetic protesters were able to force</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">the police</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">to widen their lines and engage in ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">ended up proving detrimental to their</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">overall strategic position</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">they looked like they were aggressing on</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:12.080" style="s2">the non-violent protesters and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">caused</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.080" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">calls for de-escalation</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">in fact the third precinct itself was</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">was evacuated</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">because the politicians in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">minneapolis</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:25.600" style="s2">wanted to de-escalate what they saw as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">confrontation between the peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.600" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">protesters and the police</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:32.160" style="s2">um and that that created a new set of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">opportunities for the way this protest</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.160" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">evolve over over the next few months</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.280" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">yeah quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">interesting as i was reading it you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:42.440" style="s2">i&#39;m a player of uh</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.440" style="s2">and i i suspect the author may have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:53.919" style="s2">as well because he essentially</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.440" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">calls out the various kinds of units it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.919" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">playing total war medieval or something</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">right uh you know he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">the non-violent folks but then he also</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:05.199" style="s2">explicitly calls out the ballistics and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">then he talks about the specialty units</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">the laser pointer people</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">and he goes into quite deep good detail</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">on how and when to use the laser</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">pointers</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">he talks about the fact that uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">important to have people on</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">uh police scanners listening to what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">police are doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">he goes into the details of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">uh information security oh yeah we use</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.039" style="s2">because we know it&#39;s uh secure at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">secure enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.039" end="00:06:33.199" style="s2">but we ought to be using uh on burner</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">phones so that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.199" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">stingrays i.e faults cell towers</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">operated by the police</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">uh can&#39;t get our personal information</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">and track us</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">uh so right this this was a person who</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">actually thinks about unit types and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">uh and how the tactics combined with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">unit types</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:53.599" style="s2">uh he also talks about how the looters</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">actually uh help by being a distraction</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.599" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">well on three levels he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">you know being a distraction but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">providing supplies and also building</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">morale i mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">remind me of my clausewitz right uh as</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">we know at the end of the day according</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">to klausowitz the person who wins</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">is the one whose will breaks last right</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">improving the the will and spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">your crowd the morale</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">uh is really important uh and so i</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">thought this to be a quite amazing quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">formal after action report uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">that to my mind painted a picture way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">more detail than any i&#39;d seen anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:33.440" style="s2">you know i i think it&#39;s really a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">good report</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.440" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">well written covers all the angles does</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">some analysis</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">trying to you know determine lessons</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.280" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">learned from the engagement</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">is willing to learn willing to overturn</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">previously uh agreed upon tactics in</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">favor of stuff that works</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">you know trying to figure out how to use</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">laser pointers in in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:57.599" style="s2">us context and that you know the dangers</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">of using a laser pointer is that you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.599" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">singled out by the police and hit with</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">rubber bullets or bullets that mark you</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">uh but if you&#39;re in a dense enough crowd</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">you can pull it off</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">or um if you want to drive away</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">helicopters</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.599" style="s2">you have to have you know a concerted</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:17.840" style="s2">effort by</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.599" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">many people in the protests uh acting at</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.840" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">once</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">um so there&#39;s lots of uh interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">insight from somebody who&#39;s clearly been</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">yeah my guess is this was not his first</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">uh ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">episode uh you know the level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">maturity of his analysis struck me like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">this guy has been has done this before</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">right yeah and they you know he&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">talking about how they um</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">need to develop better ways of doing um</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">fact checking</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.120" style="s2">in the field um that you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">kind of thing that we do online</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.120" end="00:08:51.200" style="s2">when when you know we don&#39;t think as</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">individuals completely in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.200" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">verifying information anymore we rely on</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">our network to do it uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">is that when somebody comes forward with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:08:59.440" style="s2">a claim</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">like the national guard is 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.440" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">away or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re marching towards us or the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">if we burn this facility down it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">explode or that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.000" end="00:09:11.519" style="s2">is that you have a large enough network</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:12.959" style="s2">of people who actually verify</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.519" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">for you i mean give you the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.959" end="00:09:16.640" style="s2">expertise give you the kind of insight</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">gather the information for you</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.640" end="00:09:22.800" style="s2">so the crowd isn&#39;t herded</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">or panicked into action that will be</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.800" end="00:09:26.399" style="s2">deleterious to their to their goals you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.399" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">it&#39;s cool to see somebody uh engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">open source warfare thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">all the pieces come together um and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">more than just the uh different unit</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">types there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:43.920" style="s2">people there with completely different</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">motives for being there</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.920" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">they talked a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">accelerationists the from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">on the right the boogaloo boys and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:52.880" style="s2">you know how they</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.720" style="s2">you know try to insert themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.880" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">the the early days of the protest</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.720" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">um but he doesn&#39;t really go deep in</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">to the different types of people that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">are showing up at the protest with you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">their different motivations so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">because i mean when people look at it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">from the outside they they tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">it has to be more than just you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.240" style="s2">anti-racism</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">given the size and given the composition</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.240" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">of the crowds</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">um but the reason it still is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">anti-racist in its</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:27.120" style="s2">core form is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">in support of that and they&#39;re there in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.120" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">large part because of motivations</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">that extend beyond that tired sick and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">tired of the administration they&#39;re sick</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">and tired of all this</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:38.240" style="s2">everything else that&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">world and that this is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.240" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">something that&#39;s actually proven itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">capable of of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">you know raising the large crowds</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.279" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">necessary to to immobilize a protest</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">yeah i think you&#39;re right that if the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">signal comes from multiple sources i</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">mean while anti-racism</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">is the key and the core uh it&#39;s also i</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">very closely related to racism but not</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.200" style="s2">the same thing by any means is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">you know tremendous increase in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.200" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">militarization of the police over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">40 years right uh you know i remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">being a kid</p>

<p begin="00:12:37.279" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">there&#39;s four four times as many uh swat</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">teams now</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">as there were in 2001 i mean and all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">excess military equipment and all those</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:49.200" style="s2">terrorist funds</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">uh anti-terror funds you know flowed</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.200" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">into police departments and they bought</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.680" style="s2">equipment in bulk and hired a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">bunch of people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:12:58.800" style="s2">did a lot of work doing counter</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.800" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">in iraq and other in afghanistan you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">know the the militarization of police</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">is probably the key point here is you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">know maybe instead of defund places</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">you know demilitarize the police uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:13.519" style="s2">maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:14.399" style="s2">better on-point goal and you know also</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.519" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">you got to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.399" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">you know the the job itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">surprisingly you know when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.839" style="s2">it you find that it&#39;s not a profession</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">even though it has a power of life and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.839" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">death it&#39;s it&#39;s not you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">licensed and controlled like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">profession where</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:30.399" style="s2">you know you have requirements for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">know training</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.399" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">the minimum standards as well as</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">continuous you have licensure you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">ethics standards you have an oath</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">and maybe this is regulated at the state</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:42.480" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">but the oversight of that should be done</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.480" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">by a professional organization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">not a union</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s not politicians it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">committee of</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">of civilians i mean it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">has an</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">kind of enduring investment in making</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">law enforcement a high quality activity</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.240" style="s2">and if you do something that results in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">an infraction of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:03.519" style="s2">then you should lose your license to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">actually practice law enforcement in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.519" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">potentially nationally so that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">self-policing</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">would you know instead of completely</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">defunding police and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">is is to actually build it back up</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">another thing is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.279" end="00:14:19.040" style="s2">look at the you start diving into the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">kind of salary tables and a lot of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.040" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">you know universities have been</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:25.920" style="s2">kind of pulling up on on state and local</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">employees you find that a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.920" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">police departments pay these guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">extraordinarily well i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">palo alto being the you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">outliers but they&#39;re guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">pulling in with overtime 350 000 a year</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">and then he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">those folks aren&#39;t unusual you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">police sergeant</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">350 000 a year so that&#39;s a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">whether it&#39;s california or not what this</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">suggests is that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">you know these organizations uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">become a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">very self dealing and very protective</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">and unwilling to change</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">unwilling to you know adapt um</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">and that we may want to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">about like charter uh precincts</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">like you know the privatization efforts</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.639" style="s2">that where citizens have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.480" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">control over who gets the contract</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.639" end="00:15:10.880" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t um or um you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.279" end="00:15:12.399" style="s2">cooperative law enforcement</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.880" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">probably a you know evolved model from</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.399" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">the community policing which focuses</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">more on the soft services</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">but um you know citizens who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">to step forward and spend time</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">and take the training and do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.199" style="s2">training necessary to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">police and to do it in a much more cost</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.199" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">effective way</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">as well as you know much more responsive</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">to the community but i don&#39;t hear any of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">those suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">well i hear him i hear him floating</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">around uh you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">couple of people put out long lists of</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:43.519" style="s2">reforms that would make the police</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">more responsive and more responsible</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.519" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">including the professionalization idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">that you floated and one that went with</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">was a requirement just as it is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">requirement for</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:54.480" style="s2">lawyers and doctors that they have</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">malpractice insurance</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.480" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">and then uh the insurance under</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">underwriters would have a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">amount of skin in the game</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">to make sure that they uh priced the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">policies right you know so a cop that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:09.440" style="s2">31 uh you know reports for excess of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:10.320" style="s2">violence uh you know his policy is 300</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.440" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">grand a year and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.320" end="00:16:14.639" style="s2">very quickly the uh the town says fuck</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">that this guy&#39;s out of here right</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:17.759" style="s2">we can&#39;t we can&#39;t afford 300 000 a year</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.759" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">uh and then the other one again you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">mentioned in passing but again had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">total change</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">uh over the last 40 years are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">police unions who have unfortunately not</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">only worked for improvement of pay and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">benefits but have been very instrumental</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">in developing</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">contractual methods to make it very very</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">difficult to even</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">investigate a crime by police i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">typically the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">oftentimes in big city police</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:49.680" style="s2">departments that have strong unions</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">the contract literally says that uh it</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.680" end="00:16:52.959" style="s2">has the force of law because it&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">the city itself</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.959" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">that the police cannot be questioned by</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">the prosecutors for</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">two to five days sometimes if the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">officer interposes that right and those</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">of us know a little bit about the inside</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">baseball</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">policing uh therefore realized it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:10.000" style="s2">quite a a smart tactical move in</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">minneapolis</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.000" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">for them to fire the police officers</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">which then uh made them not subject to</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">the union interposition of investigation</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">right so those things need to get uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">need to be gotten rid of i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">you know i&#39;m from a police family my dad</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.079" end="00:17:25.360" style="s2">was a washington dc police officer for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:26.799" style="s2">full career</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.360" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">and then he retired and then he went</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.799" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">back and did some federal law</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:30.799" style="s2">enforcement my</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">younger brother was career federal law</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.799" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">enforcement one of my closest</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">first cousins was career police so i</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">understand the police perspective and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">do understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:41.919" style="s2">that they need to protect have</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">protection to do their job and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.919" end="00:17:45.280" style="s2">to not be subject to vindictive citizens</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:47.360" style="s2">i mean hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.280" end="00:17:48.960" style="s2">every time you get a traffic ticket for</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.360" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">a borderline offense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:52.320" style="s2">very tempting to go make the police</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">officer&#39;s life hell</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.320" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">uh and police need to be protected from</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">that but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">you know to be able to force stall a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">criminal investigation</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">for you know felony misconduct strikes</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:05.679" style="s2">me as gross overreach uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">in the police unions and that needs to</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.679" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">be stopped yeah it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s really hard to reform anything</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">having to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">government employees and government</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:17.440" style="s2">services there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:18.480" style="s2">too much stop energy available and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.440" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">try to you know when they</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.480" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">whatever that is true though our whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.080" end="00:18:22.559" style="s2">system yeah whenever they put these</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">civilian commissions together</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.559" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">you know these blue ribbon panels or</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">whatever we&#39;ve heard so many of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">had so many of these in the past they</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">they come and spend</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">18 months writing a report and by the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">time a report comes out no one</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">no one listens to it the reforms don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">get instituted</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">nothing gets changed and and the panel</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">is disbanded and they go away</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">yeah so you know what what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">more uh take advantage of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:47.919" style="s2">opportunity i mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">i i see these big you know consensus</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.919" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">actions these uh big you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">where the network pretty much agrees</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">that this is something we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">with the pandemic and then and then now</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">with police reform is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">you know we should take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">these opportunities to get something</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">you know every one of these things is</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:08.880" style="s2">like giving us a gift to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">in this area in this zone of focus</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.880" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">we have the ability to actually do some</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">meaningful reform</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">i mean you know we live in a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">cold war</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">superpower relic um really not well</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">fitted for the modern world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not adapting well and needs</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">reform and try out new things and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">and try to get some</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">new energy going and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:34.640" style="s2">not and here&#39;s this mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">actually making it possible where</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.640" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">er virtually everybody i mean 60 or so</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">agree 70</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">agree that we should go do some</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.080" style="s2">something substantial in police reform</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">i mean for instance with the uh with</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.080" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">covid i mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">there are opportunities that presented</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">themselves like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">uh you know how do we stimulate an</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">economy where it&#39;s laying flat on his</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.480" style="s2">back and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">kind of flat on our back well we think</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.480" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">new ways that we think in new ways maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:04.799" style="s2">emergency ubi or or something that can</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">get everybody spending all at once</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.799" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">give people the confidence to plan out</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">three or four or five months of spending</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">um in the future and and that gives them</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:18.840" style="s2">jolt this thing to life or um we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">during the pandemic we couldn&#39;t build an</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.840" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">app</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">for helping us track it and and beat it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:26.799" style="s2">and continuously beat it</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">because we didn&#39;t trust companies and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.799" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t trust the government we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">touch each other with data we had this</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">outdated model of privacy private data</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">versus a something that actually would</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">be dynamic enough to actually work like</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">a you know data ownership</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">you know where everybody owns their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">data and then the government rents it</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:48.080" style="s2">a period of time in order to build an</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">app and make a app available to allow</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.080" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">us to be better prepared and and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.520" end="00:20:55.679" style="s2">act as a unit against an external threat</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:21:00.240" style="s2">like like kobit was or is um</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">but you know we can&#39;t we&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.240" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">any of the reforms and in large part we</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">can&#39;t even see them yet</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.120" style="s2">so maybe it&#39;s going to take another</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">decade before</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.120" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">we start to see these threats as</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">opportunities and we start to see</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">you know the new ways necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">actually solve them</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">yeah maybe this time it&#39;ll be a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:18.400" style="s2">different i don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see uh you</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">whether they actually go through with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll see yeah i think as you know our</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:39.600" style="s2">uh titled defund and redesign everything</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:41.280" style="s2">uh which you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.600" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">basically reinforces your point that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.280" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">we&#39;re living with grossly</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">obsolete social operating systems and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">maybe just maybe maybe maybe this point</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:54.880" style="s2">is a tipping point where we are more</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">open than we&#39;ve ever been before</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.880" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">uh to an effort to really look at each</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">of these things and say</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">yeah yeah you know uh one thing i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">we&#39;ll see out of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.760" style="s2">in the near future is a return of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">something akin to occupy</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.760" end="00:22:09.760" style="s2">uh groups of protesters you know taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">over a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.760" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">space in downtown sprawling over and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">refusing to leave i mean the police</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">right now are in such a defensive crouch</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">you know a lot of the aggressive tactics</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">allowed them to throw people out</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">during the the occupy movement aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">possible right now</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">um and that the occupation can serve as</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">a as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.120" style="s2">as a good way to ensure that this</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">protest doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.120" end="00:22:37.520" style="s2">completely die off and uh you saw a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.919" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">little early example right now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.520" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">what they call the capitol hill</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">autonomous zone in seattle which is an</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">early example of this i suspect we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:50.159" style="s2">probably see a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">in many major cities um in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.159" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">defunding uh yeah it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.400" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">interesting to see what happens as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">result of the defending effort like in</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">minneapolis</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a hope that the community</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.480" end="00:23:02.400" style="s2">policing</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">or you know maybe a new department</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.400" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">that arises out of the ashes will be</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">better than the one that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">had but a wholesale reform like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">really tough and it tends to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">not go well when you burn everything to</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:16.240" style="s2">the ground and try to rebuild it</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">but um on the other hand uh if people</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.240" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">pull together they could probably do a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">pretty good job of it so we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">see what happens though you know early</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:24.320" style="s2">indicators are probably not that great i</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.320" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">the uh did you see the video of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">interchange between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">mayor and uh the crowd when they were</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">you know putting the question to him you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">know asking him whether or not he would</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">defund the police i did not</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">see it but i&#39;ve heard like second or</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.960" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">third hand reports of it so</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">why don&#39;t you tell people what what</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">happened and what the implications are</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">yeah there was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">a large crowd um and some were up on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">podium</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:54.720" style="s2">um the leaders yeah and the mayor</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">was by himself surrounded by the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.720" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">and you know it looked pretty imposing i</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">you know he&#39;s probably you know pretty</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">uh scared when he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">was was being questioned and they said</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">okay we don&#39;t care about any of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">negotiation we just really want</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">to ask you one question will you defund</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">the police and he goes no</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">and then you know his cat calls and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">know the potential for him getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">getting attacked was really high uh they</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">kept on screaming at him and then they</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">opened up a corridor for him to walk</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">do a walk of shame out of the protest</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very similar to what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">think would happen during the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">cultural revolution or you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">for someone even the game of thrones</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">kind of uh situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s not i mean it&#39;s it was an</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:37.679" style="s2">interesting dynamic and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:40.880" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">um point to a kind of a constructive</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.880" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">engagement to you know to reform the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:47.360" style="s2">police uh given a defending event</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s uh that&#39;s about exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.360" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">i heard and i had the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.039" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">uh reaction this sounds an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">like the early days of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">uh and we remember where that ended up</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">right which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">uh very ugly uh you know so i i</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">i hope that people can take this moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">and be constructive but it may not play</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">out that way which</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">is something we should all keep our eye</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">out in terms of the branching of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">contingencies here as this unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">i want to go back a little a minute here</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.760" style="s2">to your uh suggestion that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">one of the things that may emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.760" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">the new environment</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">and the new sensibility of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:28.720" style="s2">on is a resurgence of something like</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">occupy and put that back in the context</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">of this after action report on the third</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.080" style="s2">precinct</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.919" style="s2">do you think that the circumstances at</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.080" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">the third precinct were unique to that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.919" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">or do you think the uh you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">tactics the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">uh the unit types etc are more generally</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">applicable</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:48.400" style="s2">to you know action in the streets uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">going forward</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.400" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">um well the specialization works um you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">know specialization of roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">the fact checking works across protests</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">the dynamic between non-violent and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">kinetic protesters that works</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">particularly in this context</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">particularly in the u.s how that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">plays into</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.400" style="s2">something like an occupy effort is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">pretty interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:11.840" style="s2">if you surround yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">non-violent protesters in in a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">it then puts you in a position of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">able to bombard</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:21.200" style="s2">everything that goes by um or keep up</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">pressure on a key building or a key</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.200" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">location either through fireworks and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">lasers and bricks or catapults</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.039" style="s2">like they did in hong kong um and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s incumbent upon the police to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.039" end="00:26:32.320" style="s2">actually try to remove it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.400" end="00:26:33.279" style="s2">remove that location and it puts them</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.320" end="00:26:35.360" style="s2">into a situation where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.279" end="00:26:36.799" style="s2">confronting non-violent protesters</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.360" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">at least according to the media and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.799" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">according to the way that things will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">portrayed and i mean the story here the</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">narrative here</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">um the pattern matching that&#39;s locking</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">this this view of the protest in places</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">is pretty inexorable it&#39;s hard to hard</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.679" style="s2">to see it any other way</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">online at least for the moment and i</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">the protesters use it as a way to align</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.440" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">they would vandalize the storefronts</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a bank or whether it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">the local businesses that supported</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.200" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">the protest so you&#39;d go down the street</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">and you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">you know pristine storefront for stream</p>

<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">and in this protest it didn&#39;t seem i</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">mean the big box stores got hit</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:01.520" style="s2">uh you know a lot of the big chains got</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:02.880" style="s2">hit clearly they think that it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.520" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.880" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">system as is and there was a certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">amount of self-identification of stores</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:10.799" style="s2">local stores locally owned places that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">that tried to you know say that</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.799" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">we&#39;re separate we&#39;re different whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">it&#39;s black owned business or you know we</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">support the protests or</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">ways of indicating that they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">aligned with the uh with the protest</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">i thought it was kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">though in the days following the protest</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">you know when you in boston and in other</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">places um the local stores and local</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">restaurants that got hit hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.279" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">immediately turned around and said you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">know even though they&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:35.919" style="s2">in the ashes of their life&#39;s work is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">that they&#39;re saying okay we support the</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.919" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">protests</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">granted it&#39;s genuine sentiment but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">also a self-defensive measure they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:43.919" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to get hurt or you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.919" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">again in the future they want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">you know align themselves with the crowd</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:53.039" style="s2">and their potential customer base</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">yep extortion is a very old game right</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.039" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">the uh it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">it was the original business of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">mafia right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">we should expect that tactic to uh be</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:04.159" style="s2">used as well because you know again the</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">thing i always tell everybody when one</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.159" end="00:30:08.640" style="s2">group invents a new tactic or in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.399" style="s2">case a system of tactics guess what</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.640" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">other sides maybe even their direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.399" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">antagonists are going to you know pick</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">and choose amongst those new tactics</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">and use them as well i mean you know the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:20.320" style="s2">nobody nobody gets a monopoly on coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">up with a new set of tactics it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.320" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">part of the common intellectual property</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">of humanity uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:27.279" style="s2">unfortunately yeah it&#39;s unclear that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.279" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">much the police can do in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">counter this that won&#39;t get them in</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">trouble in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">you know amplifying the violence or</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">responding to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">these attacks uh de-escalation seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">help a bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">you know accepting the uh taken</p>

<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">kind of pledging support for the protest</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:48.320" style="s2">uh seems to de-escalate they&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:50.559" style="s2">that in iraq to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.320" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">to de-escalate yeah i will say that some</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.559" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">of the a lot of the escalation seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">be coming from the young</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">very uh thoughtful black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:00.559" style="s2">people who&#39;ve you know gone on the media</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">and said hey we don&#39;t want this to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.559" end="00:31:04.159" style="s2">violent you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">outside assholes uh stop doing that and</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">basically has at least for the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.159" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">being stopped and so there is some moral</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">uh authority i think that has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">helpful in the least the later stages in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">the final de-escalation or at least the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">current the escalation i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">say final yet we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">what happens well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:23.679" style="s2">definitely a struggle between the uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">the non-violent core of the protests and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.679" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">the uh kinetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">groups and and the fact that even in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.600" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">article we&#39;re uh discussing earlier</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">he had to mention that that if you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.399" style="s2">engaged in kinetics that you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">it as a group because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.399" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">a lone person throwing a water bottle</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">uh or water bottles or rocks or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:45.760" style="s2">the non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:46.480" style="s2">enforcers will come grab you and eject</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.760" end="00:31:48.960" style="s2">you or</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.480" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">isolate you and deal with you in a way</p>

<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">ejects you from the protest so um</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">the group actually protects them against</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:59.200" style="s2">those enforcers from</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">uh actually uh imposing their will on</p>
