<p begin="00:01:21.570" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">do you call it</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.990" end="00:01:29.670" style="s2">yeah yeah the end the end of history for</p>

<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">because if we go back further down if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:38.700" style="s2">you go deeper down to the origins of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">Abrahamic religion and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:42.530" style="s2">difference in Egypt and Persia and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.170" end="00:01:44.520" style="s2">reinterpret China and America today</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.530" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the same difference between each</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.520" end="00:01:48.090" style="s2">of the person and realize that if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">split the phallus and have it try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.090" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">power rather than a dictatorship you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:55.159" style="s2">so much better off with absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">everything else in that society</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.159" end="00:01:59.430" style="s2">especially comes to creating proper</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">civilization rather than just mimicking</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.430" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">your neighbor mm-hmm yeah I think the</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">difference between you and these guys is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">that you&#39;re look you&#39;re looking at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">from a world perspective yes it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:12.510" style="s2">just interesting because everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">is looking at it in terms of the history</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.510" end="00:02:17.270" style="s2">of the West</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">and which is you can&#39;t do that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.270" end="00:02:23.030" style="s2">when I started doing philosophy 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:24.590" style="s2">ago I knew that I&#39;d be pathetic if I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.030" end="00:02:27.650" style="s2">didn&#39;t break with the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.590" end="00:02:30.740" style="s2">you have to stop citing and reciting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.650" end="00:02:33.710" style="s2">Greeks all the time if the Greeks did</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.740" end="00:02:35.690" style="s2">not start philosophy its way way older</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.710" end="00:02:37.160" style="s2">and to understand what the Greeks went</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.690" end="00:02:38.900" style="s2">right and what the Greeks went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.160" end="00:02:40.550" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve tried to stop persia and</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.900" end="00:02:42.980" style="s2">babylon you have to understand ancient</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">egypt and you also have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.980" end="00:02:48.140" style="s2">the East which is way older and has done</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:50.950" style="s2">these mistakes of the past and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.140" end="00:02:53.000" style="s2">survived them and the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.950" end="00:02:55.550" style="s2">eventually you end up with these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.000" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">pluralistic societies China and India</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.550" end="00:03:00.740" style="s2">fundamentally are I mean in when it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.600" style="s2">comes to rigidly different they are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.740" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">you you have different religions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.600" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">are different roles mm-hmm okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:09.380" style="s2">in Japan chin twosome is the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.790" end="00:03:11.930" style="s2">the military and the priesthood legend</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.380" end="00:03:13.160" style="s2">right and Buddhism is the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.930" end="00:03:15.530" style="s2">the monks and nuns and your own</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.160" end="00:03:18.530" style="s2">spiritual practices and it&#39;s a magical</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.530" end="00:03:20.660" style="s2">religion hmm perfect combo makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.530" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">made sense to Japanese been sent to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.660" end="00:03:24.380" style="s2">Koreans until they became American</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:26.780" style="s2">Pentecostal Christians for God knows why</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.380" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">but anyway and then you come to China</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.780" end="00:03:30.290" style="s2">you had Buddhism and Taoism with some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">the rose problem was they left the state</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.290" end="00:03:33.980" style="s2">to the Confucians they should now but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">that&#39;s where China has a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.980" end="00:03:39.080" style="s2">similar to Europe in the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">when it comes to India that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.080" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">problem the problem with India rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:44.510" style="s2">was that India happened to be weak at a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:46.580" style="s2">time when he was invaded by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.510" end="00:03:48.709" style="s2">Europeans it was invaded by the Irish</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.580" end="00:03:51.470" style="s2">before that it&#39;s also a heart it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.709" end="00:03:53.300" style="s2">country it&#39;s easy to create agricultural</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.470" end="00:03:56.060" style="s2">abundance but it&#39;s very hard to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:57.590" style="s2">military force mm-hmm and the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.060" end="00:04:00.709" style="s2">India&#39;s reacted eyes by being more</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.590" end="00:04:03.110" style="s2">magical I call it an Aikido culture like</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.709" end="00:04:05.050" style="s2">Aikido like you don&#39;t attack anybody let</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.110" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">them attack you and then you absorb them</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.050" end="00:04:09.980" style="s2">mm-hmm India is like an alien monster</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:11.780" style="s2">he&#39;s like another kind of it they kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.980" end="00:04:14.690" style="s2">of exploded the violence at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.780" end="00:04:16.669" style="s2">time they&#39;re very I think any cartridge</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.690" end="00:04:18.680" style="s2">on exploding to violence now and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.669" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">but proudly Indian less so than other</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.680" end="00:04:23.930" style="s2">cultures have but I I think we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">towards eventually a world where</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.930" end="00:04:28.930" style="s2">everything&#39;s becoming more like India</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what we should look</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:32.919" style="s2">to India for culture inspiration and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:35.949" style="s2">think India&#39;s mother agree better as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.919" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">model India is also plural fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.949" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">plural you can&#39;t even control in there</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:43.990" style="s2">from Delhi</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:45.699" style="s2">and these things are great because for</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.990" end="00:04:47.949" style="s2">the future mean even the European Union</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.699" end="00:04:49.629" style="s2">it&#39;s not really working and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.949" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t working is because we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.629" end="00:04:54.370" style="s2">daily morning newspaper in Europe that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:56.169" style="s2">everybody reads India does in India had</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.370" end="00:04:58.270" style="s2">person before that is a court language</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.169" end="00:05:00.310" style="s2">and it replaced Persian with English in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.270" end="00:05:03.099" style="s2">the 19th century so it has a shared</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.310" end="00:05:05.830" style="s2">language that they imported because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.099" end="00:05:07.360" style="s2">important it&#39;s not native everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.830" end="00:05:09.690" style="s2">speak it so it&#39;s a great idea to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.360" end="00:05:11.650" style="s2">court language that you share then</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.690" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">hopefully English can become the court</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.650" end="00:05:14.889" style="s2">language in Europe and that way you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:17.080" style="s2">look to India for inspiration rather</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.889" end="00:05:18.819" style="s2">than US and Europe and India can do fine</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.080" end="00:05:20.169" style="s2">they can be pretty peaceful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.819" end="00:05:22.389" style="s2">hopefully they can get the economic</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.169" end="00:05:26.979" style="s2">growth going to get civilization growing</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.389" end="00:05:29.169" style="s2">again but but I think so now it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.979" end="00:05:30.849" style="s2">American China and I&#39;m very very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.169" end="00:05:32.919" style="s2">skeptical about the dictatorship of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.849" end="00:05:35.740" style="s2">China and I hope they failed miserably</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.919" end="00:05:37.419" style="s2">with a dictatorship model so the China</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.740" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">could open up and go for a much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.419" end="00:05:41.889" style="s2">cool model eventually yeah China was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.940" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">bunch of kingdoms at one point right it</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.889" end="00:05:45.789" style="s2">was kind of like Europe it was like</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:47.800" style="s2">Europe at one point you know during the</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.200" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">then regard the entire physical world as</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.899" end="00:22:49.880" style="s2">evil and you will take down Europe from</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.080" end="00:25:38.660" style="s2">culture is that it&#39;s easy and accessible</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.660" end="00:25:42.620" style="s2">problem with religion is that religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.520" end="00:25:45.800" style="s2">was never judged according to its</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.620" end="00:25:47.720" style="s2">quality as a religion it was just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.800" end="00:25:49.310" style="s2">judged only because its popularity and</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.310" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">structure mm-hmm so the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.030" end="00:25:56.030" style="s2">Islamic Christian it became popular</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.440" end="00:25:58.250" style="s2">we&#39;re not because people were convinced</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.030" end="00:26:00.650" style="s2">of being Muslims or Christians not at</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.250" end="00:26:02.750" style="s2">all these are powerful religions</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.650" end="00:26:04.580" style="s2">Christianity because it&#39;s operated</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.750" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">separately from the state so the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.580" end="00:26:07.910" style="s2">could do anything it wanted she became</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:09.620" style="s2">popular with the states of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.910" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">because they kept the church out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.620" end="00:26:12.260" style="s2">state affairs at the church took care of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:15.110" style="s2">the rest</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.260" end="00:26:16.160" style="s2">so you had Christianity on one side and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.110" end="00:26:18.760" style="s2">yet everything else is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.160" end="00:26:23.090" style="s2">site separating the two and not</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.760" end="00:26:25.040" style="s2">containing the state under religion you</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.090" end="00:26:27.560" style="s2">have the secular state because of it you</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.040" end="00:26:29.270" style="s2">have the sacred and the profane operate</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.560" end="00:26:31.400" style="s2">in parallel instead of everything being</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.270" end="00:26:33.290" style="s2">under the sacred you become sacred and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.400" end="00:26:35.180" style="s2">profane operating in parallel New York</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.290" end="00:26:37.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s what happens Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.180" end="00:26:39.320" style="s2">the sacred is kept by the church&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.400" end="00:26:40.790" style="s2">monopoly and it&#39;s only interested in</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.320" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">keeping that sphere and it says that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.790" end="00:26:44.090" style="s2">we&#39;re all gonna die one day and go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:45.290" style="s2">heaven and and that&#39;s the kingdom of God</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.090" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we don&#39;t care about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.290" end="00:26:49.010" style="s2">current kingdom here mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:50.150" style="s2">it&#39;s just like ridiculous that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.010" end="00:26:53.810" style="s2">the first thing religion should care</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.150" end="00:26:56.540" style="s2">about isn&#39;t it so Islam does the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.810" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">way around it creates the umma and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.540" end="00:27:01.370" style="s2">because in Islam you don&#39;t have a pope</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:04.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a central authority you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.370" end="00:27:06.800" style="s2">have a local interpretation from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.610" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2">woman and she has sounds absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.800" end="00:27:11.000" style="s2">obvious you cannot even read the Quran</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:12.800" style="s2">yourself e or Shia Muslim you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.000" end="00:27:14.060" style="s2">to a mullah and you have to read them or</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.800" end="00:27:15.710" style="s2">less interpretation of the Quran and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.060" end="00:27:17.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the only legend you can have it</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.710" end="00:27:17.300" style="s2">because they&#39;re numerous in every</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.000" end="00:27:21.680" style="s2">village</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.300" end="00:27:24.620" style="s2">you can never unify she is on it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.680" end="00:27:28.700" style="s2">really constantly hard and it&#39;s constant</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.620" end="00:27:30.920" style="s2">civil war mm-hmm and in Sunni Islam at</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.700" end="00:27:33.320" style="s2">least you could unify it under a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.920" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">caliphate and and the Caliphate would</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.320" end="00:27:37.640" style="s2">then dictate the religion and you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:39.080" style="s2">then read the Quran for yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.640" end="00:27:40.460" style="s2">would then agree with the Caliph and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.080" end="00:27:45.020" style="s2">you don&#39;t you get your head chopped off</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.460" end="00:27:47.030" style="s2">mmm so that&#39;s the song it sounds weak</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.020" end="00:27:51.500" style="s2">this is obvious they never allow anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.030" end="00:27:54.860" style="s2">to leave the religion is it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.500" end="00:27:56.780" style="s2">the ultimate form of abuse against other</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.860" end="00:27:59.510" style="s2">people and the ultimate evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.780" end="00:28:01.610" style="s2">weakness you do not only can&#39;t leave out</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.510" end="00:28:04.550" style="s2">it to leave it you can&#39;t leave you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.610" end="00:28:07.640" style="s2">divorce me yeah I think well I in in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.550" end="00:28:10.070" style="s2">Buddhist and in a Zen monastery I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.640" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">like you you would we would do quite the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.070" end="00:28:14.710" style="s2">opposite you would you would try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:17.390" style="s2">people out you would say don&#39;t come yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.710" end="00:28:18.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what good religion is oh and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.390" end="00:28:20.840" style="s2">and then when they were there you would</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:23.960" style="s2">say the doors open anytime you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.840" end="00:28:26.630" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the sign of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.960" end="00:28:29.240" style="s2">good religion right yes it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.630" end="00:28:32.679" style="s2">force to know it&#39;s genuine religion</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.240" end="00:28:34.940" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s obvious it is so damn obvious</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.679" end="00:28:36.890" style="s2">and the only thing you and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.940" end="00:28:39.049" style="s2">discussed before in our talks in our</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.890" end="00:28:41.600" style="s2">chats is this day is that we do like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.049" end="00:28:43.760" style="s2">Sufism it has problems with dualism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.600" end="00:28:46.309" style="s2">it has its strong Gnostic heritage but</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.760" end="00:28:48.289" style="s2">we like Sufism status has its origin in</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.309" end="00:28:50.600" style="s2">Zoroastrianism Buddhism and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.289" end="00:28:53.990" style="s2">strong Sufi revival going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.600" end="00:28:55.549" style="s2">in Iraq and in Central Asia where a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.990" end="00:28:57.020" style="s2">of the Sufis are we discovering for our</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.549" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">citizen Buddhism and they&#39;re turning</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.020" end="00:28:59.720" style="s2">away from Islam</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:01.370" style="s2">obviously this is because of the Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.720" end="00:29:03.380" style="s2">state and all the havoc it is costs</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.370" end="00:29:05.000" style="s2">right so so there&#39;s a strong revival for</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.380" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">that which I find incredibly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.000" end="00:29:08.539" style="s2">and I do welcome the Sufis to go back so</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.070" end="00:29:10.580" style="s2">rashness and Buddhism stuff but many</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.539" end="00:29:12.980" style="s2">many times who feels like every neat</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.580" end="00:29:16.309" style="s2">witty would say that Sufism is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.980" end="00:29:18.140" style="s2">pre-islamic absolutely there&#39;s no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.309" end="00:29:20.289" style="s2">about it and this is the great thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.140" end="00:29:23.570" style="s2">where sera stays when Buddhism match</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.289" end="00:29:25.730" style="s2">with in Sufism the phallic version of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.570" end="00:29:29.090" style="s2">Sufism is of the thesaurus term heritage</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.730" end="00:29:31.429" style="s2">and the metrical heritage and Sufism is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.090" end="00:29:33.770" style="s2">obviously Buddhist that means that no</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.429" end="00:29:36.320" style="s2">matter logical part of Sufis and cons of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.770" end="00:29:38.779" style="s2">Buddhism and the Aventa logical part</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.620" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">new territory and then convincing</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.110" end="00:31:01.750" style="s2">everybody to become a Muslim otherwise</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.450" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">Christianity became incredibly popular</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:10.390" style="s2">are these two religions - I&#39;m over 1</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">billion followers each but that should</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:19.809" style="s2">all I mean today we need to look for</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.570" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">solutions - way bigger more existential</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.809" end="00:31:24.070" style="s2">as deeper problems than Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.450" end="00:31:25.929" style="s2">Islam have ever been capable of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.070" end="00:31:27.610" style="s2">with and we need to look for deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.929" end="00:31:31.090" style="s2">religion and deep religion is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.610" end="00:31:31.419" style="s2">not Islamic responds I don&#39;t find it</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.230" end="00:31:52.029" style="s2">I guess you see Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.549" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">Christianity itself is the religion that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.029" end="00:32:01.000" style="s2">says it&#39;s the end of religion no because</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.450" end="00:34:22.919" style="s2">okay because dictators never learn well</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.010" end="00:34:25.169" style="s2">I guess my dictator not a graphic</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.919" end="00:34:27.510" style="s2">educator cannot learn that that might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.169" end="00:34:31.559" style="s2">an addition of a dictator in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.510" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">yeah this is why Judaism goes all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.559" end="00:34:37.579" style="s2">way back to the killing of Tutankhamun</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.929" end="00:34:41.609" style="s2">and into an impost eight and his cult in</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.579" end="00:34:43.800" style="s2">Egypt because it is to Freud obvious</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.609" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">that that&#39;s where you have to begin and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.800" end="00:34:49.649" style="s2">the Freudian patricide the killing of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:55.409" style="s2">the father is the killing of the father</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.649" end="00:34:57.240" style="s2">who&#39;s overstayed his rule and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.409" end="00:34:58.589" style="s2">the dictator did the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.240" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">dictator is not that it becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.589" end="00:35:03.180" style="s2">dictator the problem of educators and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:05.339" style="s2">once he&#39;s faced in power he will only</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.180" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">have yay sayers that surround him they</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.339" end="00:35:09.720" style="s2">would not listen to bad news any longer</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:12.210" style="s2">and because of not listened to bad news</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.720" end="00:35:14.550" style="s2">it will go corrupt and because it will</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.210" end="00:35:16.650" style="s2">corrupt those who run the society under</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.550" end="00:35:18.990" style="s2">him will manipulate the population to</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.650" end="00:35:21.299" style="s2">stay within the corrupt system of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.990" end="00:35:25.410" style="s2">worship the dictator it will all go down</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.299" end="00:35:27.210" style="s2">in flames it can only end like Hitler</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.410" end="00:35:31.410" style="s2">and Stalin did you cannot end in any</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.210" end="00:35:34.770" style="s2">other way so that&#39;s why maybe I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.410" end="00:35:37.530" style="s2">to connect that to what we have called</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.770" end="00:35:42.119" style="s2">the London spiritual scene and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.530" end="00:35:45.030" style="s2">American spiritual seamen and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.119" end="00:35:48.510" style="s2">something about that that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.030" end="00:35:50.990" style="s2">feeding the this the dictator and yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.510" end="00:35:54.059" style="s2">because the passive-aggressive people</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.990" end="00:35:56.160" style="s2">have no understanding of plurality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.059" end="00:35:57.210" style="s2">like Trump and them Mellie the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.160" end="00:36:00.119" style="s2">codependent</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.210" end="00:36:03.299" style="s2">as soon as somebody&#39;s chasing you for</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.420" end="00:36:16.500" style="s2">the middle path going after the working</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.190" end="00:36:18.900" style="s2">class because that s where dictatorships</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.500" end="00:36:20.910" style="s2">always start they always start with</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.660" end="00:37:33.450" style="s2">you must be silenced you must be deep</p>

<p begin="00:37:49.350" end="00:37:52.920" style="s2">absolute arguments I will be pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.390" end="00:37:55.140" style="s2">with them and probably leave them to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.920" end="00:37:56.760" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m going to go into</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.140" end="00:37:58.470" style="s2">debates with all kinds of figures from</p>

<p begin="00:38:02.820" end="00:38:09.870" style="s2">I&#39;m totally totally Pro the debate Pro</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:12.530" style="s2">free speech Pro heretics Pro the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.870" end="00:38:15.660" style="s2">weirdest strangest ideas and try to</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.990" end="00:38:24.150" style="s2">important we live in an age where this</p>

<p begin="00:38:24.150" end="00:38:28.980" style="s2">built on a struggle and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.240" end="00:38:31.470" style="s2">want to keep the Internet as open as</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.980" end="00:38:33.720" style="s2">possible and why I&#39;m adamant that he</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.470" end="00:38:36.150" style="s2">must keep the algorithm clean and free</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.720" end="00:38:39.250" style="s2">and that is to keep the algorithm free</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.150" end="00:38:42.370" style="s2">both from commercial corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.250" end="00:38:44.170" style="s2">from political manipulation mm-hmm we</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.370" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">gotta keep politics and capitalism out</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.170" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">of the algorithm heard over the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:51.400" style="s2">mm-hmm out of the internet keep the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:53.530" style="s2">internet free and open keep the album</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.400" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">free if Google don&#39;t keep the Rodman</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.530" end="00:38:59.080" style="s2">free and clean leave Google and go</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.530" end="00:39:06.550" style="s2">manipulate the algorithms and they let</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.750" end="00:39:09.460" style="s2">money or politics influence the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.550" end="00:39:12.370" style="s2">algorithm leave build your own new</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.460" end="00:39:14.140" style="s2">algorithm it&#39;s not that hard you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.370" end="00:39:16.600" style="s2">get out of these systems if these</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.140" end="00:39:18.760" style="s2">systems cannot be trusted and as far as</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.600" end="00:39:20.770" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s the two old failed</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.760" end="00:39:22.150" style="s2">systems called capitalist and communist</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.770" end="00:39:25.180" style="s2">and they&#39;re the problem here where</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.150" end="00:39:27.640" style="s2">capitalism really is I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.180" end="00:39:29.440" style="s2">name of the commercial corruption of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.640" end="00:39:31.540" style="s2">algorithm and communists and although</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:34.150" style="s2">I&#39;d hate to say it because I love the</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.540" end="00:39:35.700" style="s2">word but I think that it&#39;s properly used</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.150" end="00:39:38.740" style="s2">today as the word for a political</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.700" end="00:39:40.360" style="s2">manipulation of the algorithm but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.740" end="00:39:43.390" style="s2">immediately discovered that this is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.360" end="00:39:45.070" style="s2">what I&#39;ve tried to do in America that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.390" end="00:39:49.690" style="s2">that&#39;s great you have you have Trump</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.070" end="00:39:53.260" style="s2">versus Sanders again yes yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.690" end="00:39:54.850" style="s2">yeah capitalism versus communism and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.260" end="00:39:57.820" style="s2">solution arrives to be hey girlie and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.850" end="00:40:00.040" style="s2">say no to both and build an algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.820" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">outside of use territory the Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.040" end="00:40:04.390" style="s2">Sanders cannot corrupt or manipulate so</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:05.650" style="s2">you can keep it clean and free because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.390" end="00:40:07.420" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the tech giants to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.650" end="00:40:09.550" style="s2">to do this I don&#39;t trust them to be able</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.420" end="00:40:11.080" style="s2">to keep the algorithm clean and free all</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.550" end="00:40:12.670" style="s2">the labor and money from putting</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.080" end="00:40:14.050" style="s2">advertising on the side I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.670" end="00:40:15.130" style="s2">political manipulation will be</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.050" end="00:40:17.140" style="s2">influencing these algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.130" end="00:40:19.840" style="s2">increasingly I want to do you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.140" end="00:40:21.700" style="s2">gonna get a fair and just version of how</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.840" end="00:40:23.580" style="s2">the world operates the great deal with</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.700" end="00:40:26.170" style="s2">algorithm it says it&#39;s only possible</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.580" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">follows today the only possible fouling</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.170" end="00:40:33.820" style="s2">order we can get in the current chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:37.330" style="s2">the algorithm so we need to try to stay</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.820" end="00:40:39.880" style="s2">in an anarchic mode and and let things</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.330" end="00:40:44.290" style="s2">be and try to keep the world as free and</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.880" end="00:40:46.570" style="s2">open as possible yeah so that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.290" end="00:40:49.030" style="s2">liked about the Weinstein conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.570" end="00:40:51.370" style="s2">probably because with Bret Easton Ellis</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.030" end="00:40:52.600" style="s2">yes with Prezi sternos that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.370" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">were I think it&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.600" end="00:40:56.370" style="s2">so those two guys was kind of saying in</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:40:58.690" style="s2">there there they&#39;re kind of saying that</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.690" end="00:41:04.230" style="s2">the second hour of the brief Bret Easton</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.820" end="00:41:06.460" style="s2">Ellis and Eric Lang shine conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.230" end="00:41:09.340" style="s2">not only spread taste and I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.460" end="00:41:11.410" style="s2">brilliant a real priest today I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.340" end="00:41:13.360" style="s2">say if you want to listen to guys out</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.410" end="00:41:14.740" style="s2">there to get it right Peter Thiel is</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.360" end="00:41:16.570" style="s2">deaf at the guy you should check out and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.740" end="00:41:17.890" style="s2">Bjorn Lomborg is the guys check out and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.570" end="00:41:20.620" style="s2">Bret Easton Ellis another no you should</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.890" end="00:41:22.270" style="s2">check out mmm so check out these guys</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:24.040" style="s2">they&#39;re right there good the good guys</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.610" end="00:41:35.080" style="s2">come up all in Jordan Peterson for God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.260" end="00:41:37.240" style="s2">sake but it&#39;s these guys get it right</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.080" end="00:41:38.920" style="s2">and what practicing artists manage to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.240" end="00:41:42.070" style="s2">is that he gets the best out of every</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.920" end="00:41:43.540" style="s2">client it mm-hmm this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.070" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">conversation the second half of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.540" end="00:41:48.730" style="s2">conversation is well they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:53.830" style="s2">lamenting the fact that that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.730" end="00:41:57.700" style="s2">millennial generation is is afraid to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.830" end="00:42:00.010" style="s2">edgy right to say to fray it&#39;s afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.700" end="00:42:01.930" style="s2">life it&#39;s is afraid of life and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.010" end="00:42:04.080" style="s2">saying that is right of sex he&#39;s afraid</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.930" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">of violence and it&#39;s a better generation</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.080" end="00:42:08.860" style="s2">Generation X or whatever is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:13.090" style="s2">be called or my generation or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.860" end="00:42:14.860" style="s2">you&#39;re a bit older than me but is is at</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.090" end="00:42:17.500" style="s2">least in that generation there was there</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.860" end="00:42:19.660" style="s2">was a kind of edginess and extreme</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.500" end="00:42:21.250" style="s2">tolerance you know because I think all</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.660" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">of this stuff that people are</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.250" end="00:42:29.980" style="s2">celebrating today like they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.000" end="00:42:42.340" style="s2">tolerance there&#39;s no tolerance but at</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.330" end="00:42:44.170" style="s2">least in the 90s in the beginning when</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.340" end="00:42:47.110" style="s2">pep rally was around and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.170" end="00:42:49.450" style="s2">thing there was like a there was a kind</p>

<p begin="00:42:49.450" end="00:42:56.980" style="s2">people didn&#39;t give a shit about gender</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.180" end="00:42:59.710" style="s2">or you know I think it is and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.980" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">why people still live in a postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.710" end="00:43:04.840" style="s2">paradigm is because they&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.370" style="s2">play around with logos and mythos as the</p>

<p begin="00:43:10.570" end="00:43:13.870" style="s2">only be mythos and because again only</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.130" end="00:43:16.930" style="s2">with us they can only be power behind</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.870" end="00:43:18.760" style="s2">what you say so if you&#39;re a powerful</p>
