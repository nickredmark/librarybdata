<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">um we asked the question i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">on august</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">5th we asked how do you feel about dan</p>

<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">and the answer that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">was submitted was always felt his</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">statements were honest even if i</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">and then democrats in our group</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">agreed with that statement at a rate of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">68 republicans slightly better at 70</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">and people who have not previously been</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">engaged in politics agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">statement at 80 percent</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about you dan that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">resonates with a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">people see you as uh as a patriot and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">must say i i see you in the same way</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">the higher office but i do appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.000" style="s2">i do appreciate it either way well we uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">we have no</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.000" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">plans to run you for higher office</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:02.400" style="s2">unless uh our nomination process goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:05.680" style="s2">that way and we have groundswell enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.400" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">to uh draft you uh as a matter of simple</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.680" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">patriotism and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">dedication to the nation but let&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about what our national</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">predicament might be um the people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">have joined our movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.919" style="s2">are quite concerned about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">seeing and although they are of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.840" style="s2">not of one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">mind i think a great many of us believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.840" end="00:05:28.560" style="s2">that we are watching something</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">historic take place and that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.560" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">things that have felt secure</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">to americans are suddenly looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">like they may be a bit more rickety than</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">we thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">do you see that picture oh yeah i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.280" style="s2">think we i think everybody feels that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">whether you&#39;re on the far right or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.280" end="00:05:48.639" style="s2">far left or in the middle moderate</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly a sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.639" end="00:05:53.360" style="s2">of polarization and it&#39;s it&#39;s and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">think people feel a bit helpless with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.360" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">nobody has a clear sense of how to drive</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:02.160" style="s2">ourselves out of that polarization</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.440" style="s2">um the the immediate reaction if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.160" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">on the left is to say well the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.440" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">started and if you&#39;re on the right the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">immediate reaction is that the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">started it they need to change these</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:11.759" style="s2">and and then we will be able to move</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.759" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">um the the moderates will say well</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">that&#39;s both sides</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:18.720" style="s2">and you know and i&#39;m of course i&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">the right and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.720" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">i do believe the statement that i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s probably more the fault of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">the other and i can</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">i&#39;m happy to be challenged on these</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:28.479" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">but this that&#39;s that&#39;s the helplessness</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.479" end="00:06:33.919" style="s2">that i think americans feel and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">they feel like they want a way out of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.919" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">yeah i would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:40.800" style="s2">um although you know you and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:42.880" style="s2">uh had a couple conversations on your</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.800" end="00:06:45.919" style="s2">podcast your podcast which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.880" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">um called we hold these truths</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.919" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">which is excellent and although i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">consider myself on the far left and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">consider yourself</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">on the right we found a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">amount over which</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">we disagree we agreed and very little</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">over which we disagreed</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">and i must say that this has been a uh a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">fairly frequent theme in my</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">conversations of late</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">that essentially good people seem to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.400" style="s2">agree on a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about that is how</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.400" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">people label themselves um</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">you know yeah you&#39;ve said that a few</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">times that you&#39;re like a radical</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">leftist and then but i can&#39;t find any</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">sort of radical left</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">um things that you believe maybe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">surprise me um</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">but this gets to a different um problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">so labels are useful um</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">especially for political science and for</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">just i think general</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:38.960" style="s2">uh you know i i think study and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">in general politics you have to to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.960" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">certain extent</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">um but you know people label themselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">uh voluntarily too</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">and and so this is this is an</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">interesting thing that i&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">that i&#39;ve had to be more self-conscious</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">of and i crossed the line probably a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:02.800" style="s2">but let me just tell you a story so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">you know my district is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.800" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">somewhat diverse it&#39;s an urban suburban</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">district we&#39;ve got a lot of really like</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">cool hot spots</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:12.879" style="s2">um in my district i like to do events</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.560" end="00:08:14.479" style="s2">at popular bars i just find that fun it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.879" end="00:08:15.680" style="s2">brings a younger crowd i</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.479" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just fun and you get to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.680" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">kind of just have a beer with people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s one of my favorite ways to campaign</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">um and and do my job which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">representing people and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">with people and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">haven&#39;t been able to do it a lot lately</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:30.639" style="s2">which has been very frustrating but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a place i like to go to often</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">and so they know who i am that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:35.760" style="s2">the point i&#39;m making i do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">events there they know who i am</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.760" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">and um and they don&#39;t seem to dislike me</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">all right and i remember just that being</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">you know just getting some food one day</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:47.519" style="s2">and grabbing a beer</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">and um the bartender was there again</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.519" end="00:08:50.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:50.959" style="s2">this woman who knows me like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.320" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.959" end="00:08:54.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not a stranger to them i know</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">exactly who i am and uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.240" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">you know she&#39;s young she&#39;s covered in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">tattoos um</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">i come from the military we&#39;ve got a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">of tattoos in the military i have</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">tattoos</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">and i&#39;m like hey those are pretty cool</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">tattoos and she says um</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">yeah you know i come from you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">neighborhood you know just north of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">houston it&#39;s more conservative but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">more progressive and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">i like tattoos and i found that so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">interesting that she would label herself</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">as a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">um because of the tattoos see i i would</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:22.880" style="s2">never do that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">so what this what this revealed to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.880" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">was that when i&#39;m criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">progressives and progressivism in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">she might think i&#39;m criticizing her when</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">in reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">we might agree on a whole number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:34.880" style="s2">things and obviously from these</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.040" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.880" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">she has no ill will towards me you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.040" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">and she knows my political beliefs and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:43.040" style="s2">she must</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">so people self-label and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.040" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">and we just have to be careful with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:49.440" style="s2">and you know i i try to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">who i&#39;m talking about more carefully</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.440" end="00:09:51.760" style="s2">again i don&#39;t think i always do a great</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">job of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:55.440" style="s2">but i try to distinguish between a</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">liberal and a leftist and a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.440" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">and a far leftist a radical leftist</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">whatever these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:02.000" style="s2">might mean and i try to explain what i</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">mean by these terms so that people so</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.000" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">that we don&#39;t alienate people and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:07.040" style="s2">probably a good</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.480" style="s2">start you know part of the way of</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.040" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">getting out of the polarization is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.480" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">stop attacking the worst ideas from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">um attack ideas directly</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">also don&#39;t don&#39;t don&#39;t play tennis with</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">each other in different courts</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">don&#39;t talk past each other because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">war of ideas is a healthy thing and i</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">and i engage in that war pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">pretty heavy-handedly frankly um but</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.200" style="s2">but you know i have to catch myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:33.680" style="s2">sometimes and stop attacking</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.200" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">the worst ideas from the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.680" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:38.560" style="s2">on the labels or at least describing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">what i mean by the labels</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.560" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">yeah well i think um the more i</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">see the older i get the more i realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:51.120" style="s2">that patriotism has</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">failed and that part of the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.120" end="00:10:56.079" style="s2">we run into is that many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:56.720" style="s2">who are involved in these discussions</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.079" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.720" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">for example root for the failure</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">of governance when it is in the hands of</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:08.480" style="s2">those they regard as the opposition</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:10.079" style="s2">which is deeply unpatriotic the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.480" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">at the point the other candidate is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.079" end="00:11:12.959" style="s2">elected you should be rooting for them</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">to succeed because</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.959" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">their success is our success and to root</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">for them to fail</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:22.959" style="s2">and worse to engage in sabotage</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">is um well it&#39;s anti-american</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.959" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">and so oh go ahead yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">i agree with that there&#39;s polling</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">there&#39;s very detailed polling on this on</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">this particular question about how you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">feel about your country</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">and um who does it</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">i think it was pew i think it&#39;s pew</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">research that&#39;s been doing it for a long</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:42.320" style="s2">time and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">so you can see how democrats and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.320" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">republicans</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">um describe their patriotism because</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">they&#39;re asked</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.360" style="s2">do you feel i think the question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">about patriotism do you feel very</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.360" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">patriotic about your country somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">patriotic et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">um for republicans it remains somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">constant</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.120" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">democrats it varies wildly depending on</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">who&#39;s president</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">there&#39;s those very clear swings</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.320" style="s2">you know michelle obama said this was</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">the first time i&#39;m proud of my country</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.320" end="00:12:11.839" style="s2">she said that in 2008 when we elected</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">barack obama</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.839" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">and and to your point we can&#39;t say those</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">things we can&#39;t say our</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s no benefit to it you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">like this this notion that the only way</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">we can be proud of our country is if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">radically transform it the only way we</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">can love our country is if we radically</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">transform it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not the right attitude it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">would you say that about your spouse</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">you know like that&#39;s i i really would</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:35.440" style="s2">love her she would just radically change</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:37.440" style="s2">herself</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.440" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">you know i have heard people say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.440" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">about their spouses but no i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.399" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say that right but not but</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">not a healthy relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">no so we should we should desire this</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:48.880" style="s2">sort of healthy relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:51.519" style="s2">with with the ideals of our country and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.880" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what patriotism is</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.519" end="00:12:54.480" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">desire uh progress doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.480" end="00:12:57.920" style="s2">don&#39;t desire</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">improvements but but we&#39;ve gotten to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">point where we&#39;re trying to undermine</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">the very foundations of the country</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">basically throw it all out</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:05.279" style="s2">you know kind of a french revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">style and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.279" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s to me is deeply dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:12.160" style="s2">yeah well you say</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">um i mean let me put it a different way</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.160" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">the core of patriotism is a willingness</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">for your country so i find myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">very patriotic i don&#39;t have any doubts</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:26.480" style="s2">about it i don&#39;t wonder about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:28.639" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean that i&#39;m not frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.480" end="00:13:30.560" style="s2">with my country that i don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.639" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">we could do better and sometimes we do</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.560" end="00:13:35.600" style="s2">things that i find</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">um maddening and needless but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.600" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">dampen my willingness to sacrifice for</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">it because</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">it is um an immensely powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">experiment</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">in human betterment it really is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">the first credible departure from a</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.360" end="00:13:54.959" style="s2">system in which we just</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">battle each other based on what</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.959" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">population we come from and one of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">terrifies me about this movement is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.240" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">i see</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:07.440" style="s2">the far left at the moment selling a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:08.959" style="s2">race first view of the world which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.440" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">going to drive</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.959" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">uh the right the mainstream right into a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">race first view of the world that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t currently hold</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">and for us to abandon the american</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:24.079" style="s2">experiment in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">um lineage against lineage</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.079" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">violence and power games seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:30.160" style="s2">such a tragic</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">waste yeah well it&#39;s critical race</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:32.959" style="s2">theory i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">critical race theory it seems to me just</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.959" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">to be sort of a modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">academic exploration of what human</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">history has always been</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">which is viewing things through through</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">a racial lens or a tribal lens or a</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.600" style="s2">group on group you know identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">politics which as you noted which</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.600" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">is kind of prior to western</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">enlightenment that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">human civilization for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">was just the warring of factions</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">and power struggles uh whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">again based on land but usually based on</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:04.720" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">tribal loyalty whatever that looked like</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">the beauty of western civilization was</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">was overcoming that</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">you know and we and you know and we do</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">it and fits and starts</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">like we have a sinful history but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">but you know in the in the long</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">you know in the i would say in the in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:27.360" style="s2">the long perspective of history we did</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">it rather quickly</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.360" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">and forcefully we&#39;re never perfect um</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">and we but we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">no matter what though i can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">this we definitely can&#39;t change it we</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">can&#39;t change the history</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">history is unchangeable last time i</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">checked and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">and this this need to dwell on it um</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">and and sort of ruin our our our current</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:49.279" style="s2">history and our future</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">because of it uh it seems very backwards</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.279" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">to me and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">and and i just think we&#39;re making we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:55.199" style="s2">not we&#39;re not making progress with</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">something like critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.199" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">viewing everything through the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">race or gender</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">or or whatever the immutable</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">characteristic is at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">given moment we&#39;re not making any</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">progress with that we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">regressing</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:08.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s very divisive you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.880" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.800" end="00:16:11.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know that&#39;s it yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.880" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">worry about that on the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.920" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll end up that way on</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">the right it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">you know as as the backlash i think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">backlash is is more</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:22.320" style="s2">chaotic than that i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.320" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think the right really knows</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">how the left always accuses us by the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:28.480" style="s2">way i know listeners will say</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">oh of course the right does identity</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.480" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">politics i i don&#39;t see a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">um you know and then again and i could</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">go into that but</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">i think there&#39;s going to be backlash and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be good</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s unclear to me what it even</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">to be honest um well i must tell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t see how it can</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">avoid that trap just the simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">experience that people have</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:56.720" style="s2">of not knowing whether or not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.720" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">viewed as racist for example just simply</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">we are being told that you can read that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">on the on the surface of someone&#39;s skin</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.839" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">means that a a social situation that</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">might have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">ambiguous or even welcoming in the past</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">is going to be viewed with trepidation</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">uh in a future where where we&#39;re told</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:22.959" style="s2">that race is everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">and i mean you said it i think quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.959" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">our history is far from perfect this was</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">a radical departure and a positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">one and the thing we&#39;re really fighting</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.840" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">over is whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">the right thing to do about our failures</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">is to finish the project and actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">live up to our aspirations to be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">race-blind</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">society or to regress as you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">to a former state where we don&#39;t aspire</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">to such things and what i find so</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">frustrating about the presentation i see</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">over on the far left at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">is that there is no awareness for what</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:08.080" style="s2">has been accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">the obsessive focus on what we have not</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.080" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">yet accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">obsessive to the point that people even</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">invent failures that aren&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">but that obsessive focus leaves people</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">with the impression</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">that they are inherently worse off</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">so for example with respect to policing</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">right we see</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">failures of policing we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">necessarily understand what they</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">are but we see lots of instances that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:38.480" style="s2">we&#39;re told are</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">evidence of brutal racist police</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.480" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">but the idea that eliminating the police</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">might be the solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">is preposterous right we don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">crimes that don&#39;t get committed</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">and many crimes don&#39;t get committed</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.880" style="s2">because you can call the police and if</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">we eliminate them you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">and crime will predictably go up and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s already going up in places</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.840" style="s2">where this experiment is being run so</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.200" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s just a failure to appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">that which</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t notice because we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">successful at it and to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">focus only on those places where</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:13.039" style="s2">plausibly we we</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t succeeded yeah there&#39;s a severe</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.039" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">and that that sort of lack of critical</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">thinking i think is purposeful</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s part of this movement um</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">part part of the philosophy the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.039" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">post-modernist philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">is to make the argument that two plus</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">two equals five and if you argue with me</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">you&#39;re a racist</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s confusing it&#39;s meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">confusing it&#39;s not meant to be logical</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">logical</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">logic is i mean and they&#39;ll say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">like i&#39;m just repeating what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">said logic means racism you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">and you know higher meritocracy means</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">racism this is and you&#39;re like what wait</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:50.799" style="s2">and and the thing is like your average</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">vote or your average like moderate</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.799" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">liberal person i don&#39;t think believes</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:57.440" style="s2">these things</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">um but i what worries me</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.440" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">is in what i i think see objectively is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.240" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">that that radical left</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:07.520" style="s2">ideology is taking over</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">the in the broad sweeping left and</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.520" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">trampling over liberals and again we</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">should be protecting liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">uh i disagree with liberals i i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">they i think they</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">are a little bit too utopian i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">they want too much government to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">things that government can&#39;t possibly do</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">but but they&#39;re not they&#39;re not critical</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">race theorists</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:28.000" style="s2">okay and they&#39;re not marxists um and we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">and we have to distinguish between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">two it gets to my earlier point and i</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">have to be more conscious of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:34.320" style="s2">sometimes but you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">i can&#39;t help my frustrations sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.320" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">um i i like the way um thomas soul</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">describes the uh getting getting to what</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">you said about</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">getting to a a color-blind society</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">and you know that that can mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:51.120" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">that means two things one is our</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.120" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">institutions and our legal system is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">colorblind so that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">describing it</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">and i think we have that um and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">there&#39;s and then the question is society</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">itself colorblind of course we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">have that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think we ever will and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">this gets to the the question</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">where i bring up thomas sowell and his</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:11.919" style="s2">and his work on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">the conflict of visions the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.919" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">unconstrained vision versus the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">constrained vision</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">these are two basic psychological states</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">in humanity and it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">how he applies them</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">and fundamentally how you would apply it</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">here would be you know the unconstrained</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">means there&#39;s there&#39;s no restraint on</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">what institutions what government</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">institutions can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">to mold human nature so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">that if we just get the right policies</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">in place we can actually make people a</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">certain way</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">now the constrained vision would say no</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a constraint on what government</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">can actually accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">and and i and i see the policies and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">see this in joe biden&#39;s platform where</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">where you&#39;re going to make the fed have</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">another mandate</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:55.400" style="s2">to fix racial inequality so you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">to impose</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.400" end="00:21:58.720" style="s2">non-colorblind color i guess visible</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.600" style="s2">color</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.720" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">you know color visible policies in order</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.600" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">in order to mold the the non-color blind</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">human nature that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">that we believe is inevitable and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">know the question is is that regressive</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">or is that progressive</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s regressive oh you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">absolutely right it&#39;s regressive and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.039" style="s2">uh the democrats are engaged in it</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">cynically</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean the democrats writ large</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">but the um</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">the democrats of the dnc are</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">toying with this not because it makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">the slightest bit of sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.840" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">but because it diverts attention away</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">from their own corruption and i mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the most unpatriotic thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">that maybe i&#39;ve seen in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:45.760" style="s2">because what it does</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">is it takes the anger that people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.760" end="00:22:48.720" style="s2">over a system that is not serving them</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.720" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">and it causes it to be redirected</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">towards other people on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">skin color on the you know based on a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">faulty explanation</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">that the only reason that you would have</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:06.080" style="s2">an inequality</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">is because of oppression therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.080" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">there&#39;s all this cryptic racism in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">heads of</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">white people that explains everybody any</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:15.679" style="s2">failure anywhere in the system of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:17.919" style="s2">anybody to thrive which is just nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.679" end="00:23:19.440" style="s2">and the real problem with that premise</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.919" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">is that it&#39;s unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.440" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s it&#39;s unsolvable by</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.760" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">okay because you can always keep arguing</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.760" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;ll never be solved if because because</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">they&#39;re by design they&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.240" style="s2">solving the core issues which could be</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">you know poverty is is it has many</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">different faces there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">reasons that somebody is in poverty</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex conversation to fix that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">but these these conversations will never</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.159" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">fix it and i think that&#39;s by design</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">because if you fix it well then what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">heck do you have to run on</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">you know how are you gonna how are you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">going to get this vote the next time and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">uh you know cynically the the easiest</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">is incurable and the job of countering</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">and then in the next sentence they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">tell you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">it can&#39;t be countered and it&#39;s just a</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">following this have no idea what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">signed up for</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">right they heard black lives matter and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">they resonated and so they signed up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">to the details of the world view that is</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.400" style="s2">advanced and wow are they going to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">surprised</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.400" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">that this is not about some world in</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">which things are more equal</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">this is about a future world in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">they&#39;re very unequal</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.640" style="s2">in a very unfamiliar direction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">completely inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.640" end="00:26:27.360" style="s2">with any of the values that that bind us</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">together as americans</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.360" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">yeah i i don&#39;t even know how to respond</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">to that it&#39;s just i</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">agree with it um it&#39;s concerning</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:38.080" style="s2">and uh it this is maybe this is what</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out is</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.080" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">how do you tell people that do you tell</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">them through a</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">kind of a philosophical historical</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:46.320" style="s2">discussion you know it&#39;s hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">reach everybody with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.320" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">philosophical discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">and and kind of pointing these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">out and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">and because moralizing is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">tactic um</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">these are moralizers i i think and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">they talk at heartstrings the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">jonathan heights</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">um illustration of the writer and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">elephant</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">i know he&#39;s your friend so i know you</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">know what i&#39;m talking about yeah but uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:10.880" style="s2">conscious and unconscious mind there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.200" end="00:27:12.960" style="s2">reason that the writers is just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.880" end="00:27:14.559" style="s2">little guy up there with those you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.960" end="00:27:16.240" style="s2">kind of control the elephant but it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.559" end="00:27:16.960" style="s2">elephant and that&#39;s the unconscious mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.240" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.960" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;s mostly based on emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">reasoning and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">the people pulling the strings here know</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:25.760" style="s2">these things and they know that and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.039" style="s2">know that people want to be good they</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">want to feel good</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.039" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">and it feels pretty good to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:30.720" style="s2">anti-racist i mean who wouldn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">be anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.720" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s by design these things</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.399" style="s2">are by design</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very clever um but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.399" end="00:27:39.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not sustainable and it always ends</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">in disaster because</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">it again how do you tell that to people</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:43.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to show them the history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.200" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">but i think then they&#39;ll counter it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">say oh no this time it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.240" style="s2">this time it&#39;s different it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">different this time</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.240" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s again it gets to this is why</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">people feel a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">helpless um and it&#39;s hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">a way out of it all we can do is keep</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">talking about her</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">well let&#39;s talk about how you uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">raise people&#39;s awareness because i do</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a pity that</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">um the metaphor of uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">being awake is being so abused in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">case because i find most people</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">who are awoke are sleepwalking right</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">but in any case look you said some</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">things about</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">liberals first of all you said some</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">things about liberals versus leftists</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">versus progressives and frankly i have</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">been on the left my whole life and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.679" style="s2">a reliable way to distinguish these</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">things i</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.679" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">somewhat resonate with all of those</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">terms though i resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.679" style="s2">almost nothing that the people who who</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">are using those terms would say about</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.679" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">their own beliefs at the moment i</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">believe we need progress but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:49.600" style="s2">believe we need progress of the type</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re pushing</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.600" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">but in any case what you said which i</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">think is quite accurate</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">is that liberals tend to be too utopian</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">and they tend not to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:02.399" style="s2">downside of the policies that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">advocating</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.399" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">right so that they uh they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">scientists who would add epicycles in</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">order to rescue a hypothesis rather than</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">recognize that it&#39;s just not stable so</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">let me tell you what i think the flip</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:19.600" style="s2">side of this is the flip side of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">is that conservatives tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.600" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">too skeptical about the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:29.520" style="s2">of a viable solution to a real problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">and they tend to be too optimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.520" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">our current state</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">so i think you&#39;re right liberals tend to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">want to solve problems and they tend not</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:38.320" style="s2">to understand that they may be causing</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">new and bigger problems</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">in so doing but conservatives tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">they will leave possible solutions on</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">the table</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">over fear of what might happen if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">attempted to solve it and disbelief over</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:55.840" style="s2">the need for it</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:56.640" style="s2">and so in some sense i this is why unity</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.640" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">is structured the way it is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:03.039" style="s2">reach people</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">is not to try to clarify these two</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.039" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">messages</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">it&#39;s to try to bring these two messages</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">together because</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">you know as i&#39;ve grown older and i i</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">would hope</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">wiser i&#39;ve come to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">it is the tension between these two sets</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">of instincts</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">in which the magic actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.520" style="s2">right you need liberals to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">imagine what might be possible that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.520" end="00:30:30.720" style="s2">would be better and you need</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">conservatives to keep them from uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">overdoing it and destroying functional</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">things in the pursuit of that which</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s been too much</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">carnage that comes from the pendulum</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">swinging back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">which i don&#39;t even think it does anymore</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">but it once did</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s a you know your temperature</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">in your body isn&#39;t maintained by going</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:53.360" style="s2">way too high and then way too low it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">tightly constrained to the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.360" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">temperature for all your enzymes to work</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">and it would be great if we could make</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">governance work that way too</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">but it is done with tension it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">with those who see one side with clarity</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">partnering with those that see the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">side and reaching</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">some sort of rational plan yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">agree with that i like the way you frame</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">that i i frame it that way often myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:19.519" style="s2">as far as this is the healthy balance of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:22.399" style="s2">liberal and conservative</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.519" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of a chaos versus order</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.399" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t mean chaos in the pejorative</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">sense um</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s but it is kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">liberalism is</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">just get it done</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:36.080" style="s2">um and then conservatives are like no</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">just if</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.080" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">you do that then all of these other</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">things you know but but maybe if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:43.120" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re a little too like you said</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">they&#39;re too tightly wound to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.120" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">to that specific tradition or or</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:50.000" style="s2">structure and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">you need a healthy balance um on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.000" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">practical level</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:53.760" style="s2">and and maybe to answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">about how i define progressives and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.760" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">leftists</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:59.120" style="s2">you know just to just for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">knows what i&#39;m talking about what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.120" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">these things progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">to me is woodrow wilson is wilsonian</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">which is a a direct rebuke to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:12.399" style="s2">constitutional order</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">a rebuke to the notion of checks and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.399" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">balances because it gets in the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">of the progress so it&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:19.760" style="s2">authoritarian highly centralized</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">highly planned economy from washington</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">that&#39;s how it started and that to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">it appears by all the policy measures</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">that they wish to take</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">but that&#39;s still what it is um but</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">progress always sounds good and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">a nice term</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">leftism i i define more and like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">again and obviously a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">things overlap</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.039" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">but leftism i tend to define as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">stuff that we&#39;re seeing that you really</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">criticize quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">um that&#39;s what i see is leftism uh as</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">opposed to liberalism which i want</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">i want to still define as a good and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">decent thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">which i have some issues with um but</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">it&#39;s also a necessary balance to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:33:00.480" style="s2">uh conservatism so as you noted and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">because of that necessity</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.480" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">uh that necessary confrontation between</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">chaos and order that is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">confrontation</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just true and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">now on a practical level how do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">resolve that with good natured liberals</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">the liberals are really good at pointing</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">out the the injustices within</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:21.919" style="s2">kind of the hierarchies that are set in</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:23.600" style="s2">society and they say</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.919" end="00:33:24.720" style="s2">this isn&#39;t fair we don&#39;t like this okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.600" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">the market&#39;s not working in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">specific case</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a very practical example</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">now i think the liberal solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">particular example will almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">always be something i disagree with but</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have a solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">okay it just means that we want the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">solution to be within a set of limiting</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">conservatism is is really about the how</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:48.240" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s incredibly important</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s why i&#39;m a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.240" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">because the how is so important</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re running for</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">office and your entire goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">developing a governing philosophy if</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">your entire</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">focus is on the what then that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">being an activist</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">also part of democracy demanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">something okay i want this to change but</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">that&#39;s activism</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the the judgment</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">required to actually solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">without creating a lot of new problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">and it won&#39;t happen as so if the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">conservatives solving it</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to happen as fast it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:22.879" style="s2">not going to happen maybe the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:25.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to maybe maybe the maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.879" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">the end result won&#39;t be as apparent</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.119" end="00:34:28.399" style="s2">right because there&#39;s not like a program</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">that we want to create necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.399" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">you can label</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">and you can say i put money into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:34.720" style="s2">program for puppies</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">because we&#39;re trying to solve the puppy</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">problem and so i</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">i made the program it&#39;s puppies you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">and so and so to me liberals will do</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ll be like uh yeah but it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:45.359" style="s2">really solve the problem and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">we&#39;re just wasting a bunch of money on</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.359" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:50.639" style="s2">puppies are still you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">whatever the puppy problem is</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.639" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">and um you know so why don&#39;t we do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">let&#39;s tinker with the markets think you</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">know deregulate over here but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">as like</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">you can&#39;t wrap your arms around it as</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">well so liberals don&#39;t like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.560" style="s2">but that&#39;s the conversation that has to</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">actually happen like let us</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.560" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">let us get let us be more open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">about what we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">but liberals need to be more open-minded</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.119" style="s2">about the how</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">and how conservatives tend to solve</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">problems because it&#39;s more sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.760" style="s2">and it takes into account more costs and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">benefits and limiting principles i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.760" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">stress enough how important limiting</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">principles are</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">i can describe what i mean by that in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">more detail like</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">yeah no i i get it completely i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:37.440" style="s2">would call it conservation laws</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">you know a belief in a structure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">actually enforces some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">discipline over your</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">solution making and i do agree that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">is frequently absent</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">on the left um but in general i i have</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">the sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">that each perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:56.320" style="s2">you know except for the entirely cynical</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:59.200" style="s2">ones each perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">has some sort of core insight that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.200" end="00:36:02.160" style="s2">drives it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:03.839" style="s2">and it&#39;s fused with a blind spot that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.160" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">travels along with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.839" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">and so um</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">you&#39;re correct about the activist</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">demanding solutions to problems but</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">unaware of what functional solutions</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">often functional solutions uh aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">beautiful and they don&#39;t lend themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:25.920" style="s2">to some sound bite that&#39;s aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">and they function because of</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.920" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">conservation laws</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:36.640" style="s2">so what i think has to happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:40.160" style="s2">is that we need to each become aware</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">of the blind spots that are coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.160" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">what we see and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">we i think both recognize that liberals</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:50.800" style="s2">are more likely to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">injustice um and there&#39;s a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.800" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">and some of it is from some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">um identifiable source that can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">addressed with a solution and some of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">is just noise in the system that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">probably stuck with but</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">the important thing is in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">solution making</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">to actually take advantage of things</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">that work so</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">let me give you an example on the left</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:20.839" style="s2">people tend to be very upset at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">consequence of what they call capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.839" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what they mean when they</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:28.000" style="s2">say capitalism some of them mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">markets and this is an absurd position</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.000" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">because markets are one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">tools we have</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">but they&#39;re not a tool that can do</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:35.119" style="s2">everything there&#39;s certain things</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">markets do beautifully and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.119" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">certain things that they can&#39;t do at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:42.480" style="s2">not even in principle and so what i want</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">to see in a future conversation</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.480" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">between those who might once have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">called liberals and those who might once</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">have been called conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:53.040" style="s2">is a recognition that really the magic</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">would involve</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.040" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">wielding markets to greatest effect</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">by keeping them out of the stuff where</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">they do harm</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">by applying them to problems that they</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">are best positioned</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">to solve and by adding basically a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">very um light system of incentives in</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:14.560" style="s2">order to steer markets to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">problems we want solved rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.560" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">ones that they will end up solving if</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">left to their own</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">devices</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">and so you know what what do you do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">somebody who says you know capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">did i just defend capitalism or did i</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:29.599" style="s2">attack it i&#39;m not even sure</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">from a conservative point of view you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">defended it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">the you said but so like the health care</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:41.359" style="s2">debate&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">a good you know policy example of um</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">it can&#39;t be a total free market it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">luxury good</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">and with uh you know defined there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">well just like anything there&#39;s scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of demand you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">say that that could be a total free</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:38:58.640" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">conservatives would say it&#39;s never been</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.640" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">a free market um it&#39;s the most highly</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">regulated uh industry in america and</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s got all these</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">strange traditions built into it that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.200" style="s2">that have a history to them and a reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">for them but are very difficult to break</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.200" end="00:39:12.640" style="s2">free from at this point</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">and we sort of piled a lot of weird</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.640" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">policies on top of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">and um but it doesn&#39;t mean you you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:20.800" style="s2">displace</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">all market incentives um you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.800" end="00:39:24.000" style="s2">should use the market incentives</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.480" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">right and we have good examples of how</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.000" end="00:39:27.200" style="s2">that might work i mean medicare</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">advantage</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.200" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">uses it&#39;s obviously a government program</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">but it uses the forces of the market to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">make insurance companies compete against</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">and therefore lower prices and premiums</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:40.880" style="s2">for seniors and it came in way under</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">budget</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.880" end="00:39:43.520" style="s2">so this is kind of the republican that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">was a republican plan and i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.520" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">trying to like pat ourselves on the back</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">here but like</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:50.240" style="s2">we&#39;re still allowing government to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">because we understand that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.240" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to work as</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.800" style="s2">a free market</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">we know that and so how do we expand on</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.800" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">that like so like that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">direction we want to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.960" style="s2">with with healthcare and i you know if</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:03.920" style="s2">it was up to me we would start solving</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.960" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">it with um</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.920" end="00:40:07.200" style="s2">primary care i think that&#39;s like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t like a whole long</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.200" end="00:40:12.960" style="s2">discussion on healthcare policy but</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">direct primary care is a phenomenal um</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.960" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">gateway to i think solving so many</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.880" end="00:40:19.520" style="s2">issues with health care</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">is that you know the best way the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.520" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">that people need the most is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:24.400" style="s2">is a is a doctor they trust that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">choose</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.400" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">that they have a relationship with just</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">a primary care doctor</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">this is very important i think in health</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:33.280" style="s2">care we have a system already in place</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s just sort of grown</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.280" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">slowly it&#39;s big here in houston i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">know how big it is around the country</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">but a direct primary care system means</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">you know you&#39;re a doctor and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">subscription service</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">basically 75 bucks a month is about is</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">considered the average</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:50.160" style="s2">so that&#39;s a cell phone bill it&#39;s a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:51.359" style="s2">cell phone bill and now you have total</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.160" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">access to a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.359" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">as a primary care doctor it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">insurance it&#39;s not catastrophic care</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s total access to a primary care</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">doctor and that involves quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">services</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">that you&#39;re never paying for because you</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">just have a monthly bill</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">and people really like that it also</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">it also has the effect of reducing</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">premiums because because companies</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">will i&#39;m really passionate about this</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">that&#39;s why i&#39;m kind of going a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:17.359" style="s2">details on this one</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:19.040" style="s2">but uh so companies will actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">you know contract with a primary care</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.040" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">doctor in this in this particular model</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:24.880" style="s2">and then everybody&#39;s premiums go down as</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.280" end="00:41:27.119" style="s2">well so you have to have both</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">but you&#39;re reducing costs massively and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.119" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;re giving people what they want</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">again which is a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s also an easy relationship it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">like okay i&#39;m still sick i&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:38.319" style="s2">or i&#39;ve got this like weird</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">mole on my nose something um</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.319" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">uh if i go see my doctor is there a</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">copay do i have to call my insurance</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">company like how do we set this up i</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">people would get very annoyed with this</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:51.359" style="s2">for good reasons</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:53.200" style="s2">and this takes all of that out of it um</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.359" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s i think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.200" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">great step forward so</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">but how do you but can everybody afford</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">75 bucks a month</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">well no not necessarily so so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">simple question</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">is that just subsidize it and give them</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">an hsa account a health savings account</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">is something everybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">americans should have and you can for</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">the people who can&#39;t afford it can you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">subsidize that</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:16.720" style="s2">that cost and so again government has a</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">role here</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.720" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s a light touch and and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">allowing market forces to compete</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">because doc yeah well a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">health care system one it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">difficult problem to solve</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">in part because of a political feedback</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">loop in which</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">um very well-resourced industries have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">lot of influence over policy which</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">amounts to a veto</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">over whatever policy might best</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:48.079" style="s2">serve the public and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:49.599" style="s2">one of the problems if you try to apply</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.079" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">insurance</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.599" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">in a market context without proper</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">regulation what you get</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.640" style="s2">is the inevitable discovery that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">profitable way</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.640" end="00:43:02.800" style="s2">to make money in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">insurance is to ensure the people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.800" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">need it least</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">and abandon the people who need it most</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">and externalize the cost of their having</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.319" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">abandoned which we see again and again</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.319" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">so this is why</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t have universal health care is</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">serve the interests of those who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">making a profit</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">in health care at the insurance level</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.839" style="s2">even though it would certainly</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:26.880" style="s2">serve the nation and it&#39;s another place</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.839" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">where you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.880" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">i&#39;m not a socialist but there are places</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:34.720" style="s2">where we need to socialize something</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">and it is you know a risk pool</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">that distributes bad luck um so that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">costs of it are evenly born</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">is desirable now not everything medical</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">is bad luck if you&#39;re smoking that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">bad luck that may be the result of bad</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">decision making</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">but in general if you&#39;re struck by a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:54.400" style="s2">skin cancer because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">happen to get hit by a a bit of uv</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">radiation and it caused a mutation then</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">you know we all should pay some cost</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.720" style="s2">in order to deal with the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">of that mutation rather than those</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.720" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:08.560" style="s2">have the bad luck uh can be medically</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:10.319" style="s2">wiped out by it</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.560" end="00:44:12.880" style="s2">and those people who have the good luck</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.319" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">uh effectively profit by uh having</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.880" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">rolled the dice and them</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.560" end="00:44:21.200" style="s2">you know uh coming up uh positive</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">but in any case there is a readily</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.200" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:25.839" style="s2">set of solutions they will be far from</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.839" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">but they could be vastly better than</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.440" style="s2">what we have and i can&#39;t speak with any</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:34.319" style="s2">authority to the situation you describe</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.440" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">um in the plan you just mentioned but</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.319" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">nonetheless it&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">case for um a hybrid approach that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:44.000" style="s2">leverages</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.720" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">our ability to socialize costs that have</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">informational value right the same way</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">we do with</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:52.480" style="s2">you know paramedic services or fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">suppression</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.480" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">um we should incentivize people to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">behave in uh healthy ways to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:02.880" style="s2">the overall cost of the system all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">these things are readily comprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.880" end="00:45:09.200" style="s2">and could be built into a comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">system were it not for the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.200" end="00:45:13.280" style="s2">uh our collective interest is probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">for the foreseeable future in</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">competition with a private interest that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.359" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">has more power</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">in government than than citizens do</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">yeah um okay so a lot to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">there that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:30.640" style="s2">industry</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:32.240" style="s2">and their lobbying industry they all</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.640" end="00:45:34.960" style="s2">compete with one another</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.240" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they&#39;re all united against</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.960" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">you know the interest of the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re united against each well</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re in combat</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">against each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">which it isn&#39;t all that unhealthy really</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">um because that you know the competing</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">interests kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:53.680" style="s2">keep one from becoming too powerful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely complicated the the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">key problem that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">which is which which drives a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">people towards medicare for all is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:04.720" style="s2">you know the the pre-existing conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">issue the catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">injury issue you know the the brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">tumor</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">that costs ungodly amounts of money to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">to deal with and you know one solution</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">okay so we could do socialized medicine</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">pay for it out of federal tax dollars uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">the obamacare solution was basically</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:25.520" style="s2">just require insurance companies to</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">to you know cover pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.520" end="00:46:30.400" style="s2">conditions</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:32.160" style="s2">um the other solution is i i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">dividing healthcare up into about three</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.160" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">categories one is the direct primary</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">care that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:37.920" style="s2">that i talked about earlier the second</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">is sort of your intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.920" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">um insurance you know a broken leg um</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">a temporary illness things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">then there&#39;s the catastrophic stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">know the pre-existing conditions the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">lifelong issues that you&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">um you know the catastrophic uh injury</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">um that&#39;s where the risk pool idea comes</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">in that&#39;s where we&#39;re going before</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">obamacare the state-run risk pools i</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:02.640" style="s2">still think that&#39;s the better solution</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:03.839" style="s2">or reinsurance programs a lot of states</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.640" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">that really</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.839" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">have driven down premiums while still</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">protecting people with pre-existing</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">conditions using reinsurance which</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">means once it gets to a certain once the</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">cost gets to a certain point that goes</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">to it you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">the bill goes to the government i that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">just a much more reasonable way and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:20.400" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">what that does is it maintains the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.400" end="00:47:24.079" style="s2">market forces because i want</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:25.200" style="s2">all of these health care entities to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.079" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">continue to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.200" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">to compete against each other right you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">don&#39;t like big pharma</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:31.359" style="s2">okay well then you should really like</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">insurance companies because they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.359" end="00:47:33.760" style="s2">ones who</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">negotiate with big pharma they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.760" end="00:47:37.920" style="s2">ones who keep those prices down</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">um you could have it be the government</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:41.440" style="s2">but you&#39;d still have the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:43.119" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t change anything people think</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.440" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">it changes something it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.119" end="00:47:47.119" style="s2">what what socialized medicine would do</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">is basically the way it even the way it</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.119" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">even comes into the budget that bernie</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">sanders proposes or that elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">warren proposed which are basically all</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">around the same budgets and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">kind of agrees upon</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">the way you even get to that is by</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">maintaining current medicare and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">reimbursement rates</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">which is by definition about 70 70 cents</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">on the dollar</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:08.319" style="s2">so what you&#39;re really doing to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">that budget without you know is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.319" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">you&#39;re still going to double people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">taxes but if you really want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.599" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">what the hospitals need to stay up to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">their current level</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">you need to pay your body to triple</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:19.920" style="s2">people&#39;s taxes</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">and so you&#39;re talking about price</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.920" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">controls fundamentally so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">that&#39;s a big consequence when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.079" style="s2">implement price controls what happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">when you do that well you just produce</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.079" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">less</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just as a simple rule of life if</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">you have price controls on something</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:33.839" style="s2">that the person who produces that good</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">will produce less of it doctors have</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.839" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">less incentive to to get that next</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.359" style="s2">specialty to become the best doctor</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">possible to do that next</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.359" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">you know breakthrough research because</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting paid for it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">um i&#39;ve talked i can talk to a million</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">places around here in houston</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">like more like independent service</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:52.160" style="s2">industry you know people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.760" style="s2">places that do dialysis you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.160" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">that&#39;s their core</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.760" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">thing and then okay so if medicare if</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:49:00.079" style="s2">you guys only get paid with medicare</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">reimbursement rates what happens oh we</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.079" end="00:49:03.359" style="s2">just closed down we&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s like not even it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.359" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">even a complex</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:08.000" style="s2">question for them it&#39;s just yeah we just</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:10.640" style="s2">closed down so there&#39;s there&#39;s just less</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.000" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">there&#39;s just less of things and we start</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.640" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">to look a lot more like canada than uk</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">i think we have this sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">romantic view of what canada the uk look</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:19.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:21.040" style="s2">um but we should we should talk to more</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.839" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">canadians and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.040" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">britain&#39;s about that it&#39;s it&#39;s very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:26.640" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s cost</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.640" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">to what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">there&#39;s trade-offs and we can&#39;t pretend</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:32.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">with this conversation i know this</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.160" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t meant to be like a super in-depth</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">talking about it but i know that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.760" end="00:49:46.000" style="s2">the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">no look i i like it for one thing um</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">um which is you know i&#39;ve heard you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">say this is about trade-offs i don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">my scientific background but trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">are where it&#39;s at with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">complex systems if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">understand them and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">uh fix them if you&#39;re in the position to</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">manage them</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">then trade-offs are are the only game in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.319" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">town</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">but i&#39;ve heard you say that there are</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">socialized there are aspects of this you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">use uh markets to address</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">you know i hear a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:23.040" style="s2">person recognizing that you have various</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">different levers and that they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.040" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">you know different costs and benefits</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:28.880" style="s2">associated with them so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.400" style="s2">that&#39;s all music to my ears it does not</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">sound like the normal political</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.400" end="00:50:35.920" style="s2">conversation i typically hear</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">where people have um effectively</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.920" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">religious devotion to some set of policy</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">proposals that they&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">constitute the solution and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">anybody who stands in the way of them is</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:48.960" style="s2">the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">you know i hear a practical person</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.960" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">saying look this is complex</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s never going to be perfect even the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">systems that we think we would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">you should talk to people who actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">live under them which is very</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">interesting when you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">i never hear british people rave about</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">their system</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">but if you ask them what they prefer our</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">system i hear them say no</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:09.359" style="s2">typically in fact i&#39;m never i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:10.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve ever heard one say that they would</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.359" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">prefer to live</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.079" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">under our system so unless they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">unless they have a very bad cancer then</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">they&#39;re coming right here to houston</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the only that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">the only difference um</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.720" style="s2">we&#39;re the best at treating the most</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">cutting-edge diseases we have the best</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.720" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">of everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s we pay a hell of a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s a too complex but we</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">that it&#39;s definitively true and this</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">gets lost in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">like we have access to i think like</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">australia i could i could pull up so</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">many stats on this but they have like</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">access to like only 60</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">of the drugs that we do and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">cutting edge stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.559" style="s2">obviously they have all the generics</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">they have all the old stuff but the new</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.559" end="00:51:49.760" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s here now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s expensive and people get really</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.760" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">upset about that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not super obvious what you do about</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">that because you want it to be produced</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:57.520" style="s2">in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.359" style="s2">so i can put price controls on that</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:02.079" style="s2">which is hr3 right that&#39;s been voted out</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.359" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">of the house twice now this past year</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.079" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">that&#39;s just it&#39;s just price controls</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple solution um</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">but it also means you&#39;ll never create</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.280" end="00:52:11.520" style="s2">anymore you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">just which is like it&#39;s a bad thing too</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.520" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">no that&#39;s a problem you could solve with</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">subsidies and of course that becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">problem of its own if you become</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">addicted to the subsidy mechanism rather</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:21.280" style="s2">than using it judiciously for things</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.280" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">it actually needs to be applied in order</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">to get uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">research funded but um so if we could</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">step back a second</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">uh yeah away from healthcare well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">healthcare can</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:37.920" style="s2">can uh recede into the distance here but</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">i have the sense if you and i were to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.920" end="00:52:42.160" style="s2">meet at a barbecue</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">right didn&#39;t know each other just uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">happen to be standing in the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:47.520" style="s2">corner of the lawn i have the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">we could go a long time</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.520" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">in discussion that we would disagree</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">about some things we&#39;d agree about some</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">but i&#39;m not sure i would necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">know where to place you politically</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">after that discussion i might just have</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">that&#39;s because republicans are really</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">bad at communicating um</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">and so one of the reasons i ran was</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">because i i want to communicate our</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">ideas better</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve said is is very</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">republican um</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">and and not all of it you know so</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">there&#39;s some super conservatives who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">like wait a second did you say you</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">you want to subsidize the dpc the direct</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2">primary care into a health savings</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">account but like</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.040" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">well yeah but yeah i did you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">they&#39;re like ah i can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:30.880" style="s2">but but what we&#39;re really doing is is</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">actually combining it with medicaid so</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.880" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s actually not this everything</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:36.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve said is not controversial on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:38.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.079" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">at all um there&#39;s going to be some</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.559" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">slight disagreements but</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">you know the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">republicans with respect to health care</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:44.240" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:44.960" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really i know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.240" end="00:53:46.559" style="s2">supposed to talk about health care</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.960" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s just we haven&#39;t like come</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.559" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">together but in the broader sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:52.079" style="s2">republicans are very bad at explaining</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:54.960" style="s2">conservative ideology</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.079" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">we get way too wrapped up in you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.960" end="00:54:00.079" style="s2">responding to the left</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.960" style="s2">and this and it always makes us look bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.079" end="00:54:03.200" style="s2">like i</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.960" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">for some reason and i do feel unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.200" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">treated just as a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">i think i think you know somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">a centrist will</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">for some reason gives the left a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:13.280" style="s2">more leeway and criticizing the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.160" style="s2">but as soon as we criticize the left it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.280" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">feels like</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.160" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">it feels like all my centrists are like</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">why are you so divisive</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.440" end="00:54:22.079" style="s2">i&#39;m like i&#39;m like i&#39;m not i&#39;m just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">just responding like come on</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.079" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">you know so that&#39;s the conservatives</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">feel that frustration it makes them very</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">angry</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:30.319" style="s2">and then they don&#39;t communicate well and</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.319" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">you know proper communication and again</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">but proper key to make communication</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">based on a common set</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">of the logical rules of thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">um would go a really long way i</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">i think so that&#39;s that&#39;s my criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:48.480" style="s2">the rights why it&#39;s why i got involved</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">in politics</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.480" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">well i mean i think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:55.040" style="s2">else going on here</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.839" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">and i i frequently hear people on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.040" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">decrying the failures of the left as if</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:05.119" style="s2">the left has never made any sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:07.040" style="s2">and this i think is another tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.119" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">because the left has been</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.040" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">correct about a lot of stuff that&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:14.400" style="s2">become part of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:15.440" style="s2">mainstream american values and so now i</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.400" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">hear people</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">on the right commonly espousing uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">positions that were once um</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:25.839" style="s2">solidly on the left and have now just</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">been adopted as part of our</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.839" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">our core belief system and so i i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">i think you&#39;re you&#39;re both right</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.799" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">go ahead what what well i was gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.920" style="s2">what do you mean by that what</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:43.599" style="s2">what are what are some values</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.920" end="00:55:46.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say um tolerance</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.599" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">uh tolerance is something that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.480" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">fought for by the left</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">and i now find people on the right not</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">the far right</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">but the majority of the right is now</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:56:01.680" style="s2">um entirely on board with</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">this idea it has become comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">it and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">you know that&#39;s um that&#39;s an achievement</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">right and so you know i&#39;m not looking to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">claim credit for my side where it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">succeeded and indeed it&#39;s failed in many</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">places but</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">um but there is some sort of recognition</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:22.480" style="s2">that we have the left and the right have</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">been navigating</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.480" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">together and they have achieved a great</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">deal</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">and then maybe progress has stalled um</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:32.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s a question about where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">stalled how how good are things</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.960" end="00:56:36.480" style="s2">what still remains to be solved and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">would be what would we be foolish to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.480" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">attempt to solve because we&#39;ll cause</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:41.359" style="s2">greater problems than we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.920" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s a conversation i</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.359" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">want to see i don&#39;t have the answers</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.920" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">myself but i do you know i probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">have talked to you before about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">hidden tribes report have you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">uh no i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">that the hidden tribes report</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:01.040" style="s2">is very interesting basically it</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:03.359" style="s2">describes</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.040" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">a set of different ideological tribes</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">that are cryptically</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:10.960" style="s2">within the american population and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">the part of it that is so startling the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">first time you read it</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">and then in my case certainly matches my</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">experience talking to people</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:21.119" style="s2">is that almost 70 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:24.720" style="s2">american population</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.119" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">is in basic agreement about what america</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.720" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">should look like</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">and it&#39;s just not extreme in almost any</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.480" style="s2">regard</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">right it has you know it&#39;s queasy</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.480" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">about abortion it doesn&#39;t want to see it</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">outlawed it doesn&#39;t want to see it</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:40.880" style="s2">in the third trimester except in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">extreme circumstance but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.880" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">um well what the hidden tribes report</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">calls it is the exhausted middle</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">it&#39;s this large group of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:52.720" style="s2">feeling unrepresented because what</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:55.599" style="s2">happens is that our fringes</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.720" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">start bossing around the discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.599" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">put a giant divide between</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">factions and it keeps people who are on</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">the mainstream left and the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">right from recognizing that actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:09.280" style="s2">they you know in my experience i would</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.280" end="00:58:12.960" style="s2">the mainstream left and the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">right agree about what society</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.960" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">should look like they disagree about how</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:18.880" style="s2">close we</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">are to that state and they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.880" end="00:58:22.640" style="s2">about the ordering of priorities they</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">have the same values but they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.640" end="00:58:26.240" style="s2">about which ones are the top values and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">this is a place that actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.240" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">the right has been more correct one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">the things that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">come to understand is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">trade-off between values</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">but there&#39;s one value that doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:41.359" style="s2">that rubric and it&#39;s liberty</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">and the reason liberty is special is</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.359" end="00:58:45.119" style="s2">because liberty</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:47.119" style="s2">realized liberty not abstract liberty</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.119" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">but real liberty that you can exercise</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.119" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">requires other problems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">solved right</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">so if you&#39;re medically compromised then</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">you&#39;re not really free so to liberate</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">you we have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:01.520" style="s2">your you know your medical jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:03.520" style="s2">problem for example</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.520" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">if you want to be really free we have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.520" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">figure out a way to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:08.240" style="s2">get you a proper education because</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">education provides the tools that will</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.240" end="00:59:12.559" style="s2">allow you to use that liberty</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">for something worthwhile so liberty is</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.559" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">the integrative</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">value at the point you&#39;ve achieved all</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">of the stuff necessary to get liberty</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">you don&#39;t have much left to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">and so um now that said i think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:27.680" style="s2">right has been a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">um deaf to the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.680" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">abstract liberty you know in theory</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;re free</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">but in a practical sense you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t earn a wage for example um</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:43.760" style="s2">but that were we to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:45.359" style="s2">that we could use liberty as a proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">the overall success</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.359" end="00:59:50.079" style="s2">of our system and that our obligation</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:52.079" style="s2">was to try to get liberty to as many</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">americans as we can which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.079" end="00:59:56.720" style="s2">to free them from the things that block</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">um the exercise of liberty then</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:00.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good way of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">the trade-offs because as you go too far</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.319" end="01:00:03.920" style="s2">in the direction of one value and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">begins to erode another it shows up</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.920" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">as a deficit of liberty and so in any</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">case it&#39;s a way it&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:11.680" style="s2">recognize that although we sound like we</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.680" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">very frequently we&#39;re not disagreeing</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">something substantial that we you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">i i almost never meet an american that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.400" style="s2">likes the idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:25.200" style="s2">that your skin color should be an</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.400" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.200" end="01:00:28.640" style="s2">uh indicator of your likelihood of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.640" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">right whether you&#39;re on the right or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">left you want to see a nation in which</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">skin color just</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an implication for success</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:38.640" style="s2">right that&#39;s what all the decent people</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.640" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">um and so anyway that&#39;s great that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">achieved that it wasn&#39;t always that way</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">so i i hope that those on the left and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:50.160" style="s2">those on the right who are not part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.160" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">fringes that have a uh a toxic view of</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">how we should behave towards each other</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:58.480" style="s2">can actually recognize how much we would</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:00:59.839" style="s2">have to gain if we could have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.480" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.839" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">where where we disagree for example</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">about how to prioritize our liberties</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">or our values but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">the distinction on how we view liberty</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">is an important one i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">actually broke i agree with it and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">wrote about it in the op-ed i did on</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:22.400" style="s2">on the reason the reason that we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">divided politically</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.400" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">on whether lockdowns are good or bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">and the notion that different that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a different description of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">liberty on the right and the left and</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s and that is that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">reasons we differ politically</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.640" end="01:01:38.079" style="s2">so i agree with it and i certainly fall</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">into the category of of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.079" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">believing that more liberty is good and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:42.480" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to take away some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">liberty</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">for the sake of a service we better have</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">a very very good reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:49.440" style="s2">uh for doing so and and we can it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">to say we can&#39;t have both but we need to</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.440" end="01:01:53.440" style="s2">be very careful about what that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:54.559" style="s2">looks like of course you know and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.440" end="01:01:56.960" style="s2">providing</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.559" end="01:01:58.799" style="s2">government-provided institutions like</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">you know education</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.799" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">um makes a lot of sense if you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">people to pursue their happiness which</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">is the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">goal of government to protect the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:11.760" style="s2">to pursue your happiness</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">and your life and your liberty these are</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.760" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">inaudible rights that it&#39;s government&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">job to protect</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">and and that and that involves setting</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">up a set of structures so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">able to pursue</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">those things and if those structures are</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:23.760" style="s2">failing then that&#39;s something we should</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">um so yeah i think we we could we could</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">agree on that we probably still fall a</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">little bit different</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">on the spectrum about how far to go um</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">but you know uh the other thing you were</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.319" style="s2">saying about um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">the the uh the exhausted middle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.319" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">an interesting part</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">and you know this gets into some</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">political science insights i think and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">you know how the heck do you establish a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">sort of moderate platform like what does</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">that look like</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:54.079" style="s2">and you know i i don&#39;t know i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:55.200" style="s2">there yet i can&#39;t figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.079" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">necessarily because</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.200" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">what i&#39;ve noticed is that the it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:00.240" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">for politicians on the right or the left</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.240" end="01:03:04.319" style="s2">to even like</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:05.440" style="s2">figure out what the middle is because</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">people have different opinions in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.440" end="01:03:07.839" style="s2">middle and it can mean a few things</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">sometimes you just have different</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.839" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">opinions sometimes you create the lesson</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">times you agree with the right you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re really politically attuned</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">but but you just have different and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">you consider yourself an independent uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">but sometimes it just means</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.440" style="s2">i just take my kids to school i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">to just work and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.440" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">i&#39;m just independent because everybody</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:26.319" style="s2">seems crazy right and so they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not just they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">involved in politics so you really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:31.599" style="s2">even you&#39;re not really sure how to reach</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">that voter they might have just seen you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.599" end="01:03:34.240" style="s2">on tv once and they kind of like you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">they like the way you talk and okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.240" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s um it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">capture that movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">is is my point and it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:45.280" style="s2">to establish</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">a a platform around it and and i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.280" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the challenge that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">continue to see but it is frustrating</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">because like you used abortion as an</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:55.760" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">um yeah i mean public opinion would show</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.760" end="01:04:00.400" style="s2">exactly what you just said but 12 weeks</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">if we went by pure 12 like a public</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.400" end="01:04:03.520" style="s2">opinion on abortion the limit would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:06.559" style="s2">12 weeks</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.520" end="01:04:08.160" style="s2">um i&#39;ll tell you what if that was</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.559" end="01:04:09.599" style="s2">that was proposed right now all</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.160" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">conservatives would vote for it we think</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing victory</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.200" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">and it would calm the conversation down</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.599" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">quite a bit um we are extreme in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">on abortion compared to france and all</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.880" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">european countries basically</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:27.760" style="s2">they all have 12 weeks as the limit</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s an interesting example</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.760" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">that goes to show like</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:35.520" style="s2">how strange this</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">system is um it&#39;s because people play in</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.520" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">teams</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:40.240" style="s2">you know people have a need to play in</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:42.079" style="s2">teams and it&#39;s also i&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.240" end="01:04:44.000" style="s2">voters it&#39;s about trust</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.079" end="01:04:45.440" style="s2">and so they you know maybe a lot of you</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">know independent liberals and</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.440" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">independent conservatives</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:53.200" style="s2">i might disagree with me or tulsi on</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:55.520" style="s2">on something um but they just there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.200" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a predisposition you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">conservatism is a disposition</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:01.839" style="s2">liberalism is kind of a disposition and</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">you know you&#39;re just predisposed to</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.839" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">trust whoever</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.119" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">espouses you know the most amount of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">your ideas and it&#39;s really difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:08.640" style="s2">find that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:10.640" style="s2">that middle because it&#39;s a knife edge</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.640" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">and it falls away rather quickly</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.640" end="01:05:17.520" style="s2">um that&#39;s the challenge i don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">solution necessarily it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.520" end="01:05:21.280" style="s2">interesting to talk about well i got two</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">last points for you i know you have to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.280" end="01:05:24.319" style="s2">go and i want to be respectful of your</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.319" end="01:05:28.640" style="s2">but one thing that we discovered i was</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">surprised at it</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.640" end="01:05:34.559" style="s2">was that the unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">um platform that&#39;s not even the right</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.559" end="01:05:37.200" style="s2">word for it but the structure that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.799" style="s2">brought people</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.200" end="01:05:43.039" style="s2">to us did something unexpected</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.799" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">which is not only did it bring people</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.039" end="01:05:48.000" style="s2">equally from the right and the left</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">but it brought in something like 25</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.000" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:53.680" style="s2">of our volunteers are people who were</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">not going to vote</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.680" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">so this uh disengaged group who i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:00.319" style="s2">you know the disengage group involves</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">two subgroups one of them</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.319" end="01:06:04.480" style="s2">is apathetic and the other one is so</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">frustrated that they&#39;ve walked away</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.480" end="01:06:09.200" style="s2">and the difficulty that you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.760" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">of finding something that actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.200" end="01:06:14.079" style="s2">appeals to that exhausted middle</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">is something i think we&#39;ve tapped into</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.079" end="01:06:19.359" style="s2">and so maybe that&#39;s a model of something</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">but the other thing i wanted to say is i</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.359" end="01:06:24.480" style="s2">i have now run into this as somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:27.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t think of myself as a centrist</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.480" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">i began when i introduced the plan</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.920" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">i described it as taking somebody from</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:32.960" style="s2">the center left and the center right and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:35.039" style="s2">i realized</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.960" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">quickly thereafter what a mistake it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.039" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">to use the term center</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.880" end="01:06:40.559" style="s2">because center means two different</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:41.839" style="s2">things and one of them is not very</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.559" end="01:06:45.039" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.839" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">the center has a kind of a tepid</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.039" end="01:06:49.359" style="s2">feel to it right that it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">ambitious or interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.359" end="01:06:52.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s almost a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:54.319" style="s2">resignation</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:55.599" style="s2">the other thing that the center is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.319" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">reason i invoked it</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.599" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">is that i know that even those of us who</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">aren&#39;t anywhere near the center</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:01.760" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">have to meet there in order to discuss</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.760" end="01:07:05.520" style="s2">what&#39;s actually in the interest</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:06.960" style="s2">of the nation at the center is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.520" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">natural meeting place</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.960" end="01:07:11.440" style="s2">even for those who don&#39;t see themselves</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">as as centrists and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.440" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">what i really want is a view of center</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">in which we don&#39;t assume</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:20.640" style="s2">a mild version of policy but we take</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">kind of an a la carte version where</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.640" end="01:07:24.799" style="s2">there are things that the right has</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">correct and where the right is correct</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.799" end="01:07:27.119" style="s2">we ought to go with it</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">and there are other places where the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.119" end="01:07:30.559" style="s2">left has it correct and we ought to</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">go with those things but we ought to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.559" end="01:07:34.480" style="s2">it in discussion with each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">so that we don&#39;t keep suffering from the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.480" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">pendulum swinging or the excesses of one</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">versus the other but what we really find</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:43.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">what is possible and how we can get</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.680" end="01:07:47.440" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:49.359" style="s2">at the lowest possible price</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.440" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">and you know isn&#39;t that inherently the</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.359" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">patriotic conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:56.480" style="s2">yeah i mean you know an easy way to</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:59.680" style="s2">solve that</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.480" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">you know is maybe a an agreement in</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.680" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">congress to</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">have more discreet voting what i mean by</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:08.079" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:11.359" style="s2">the coronavirus packages are a perfect</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.079" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">example of this where</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.359" end="01:08:14.880" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t have to wait multiple</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.880" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">to spend trillions of dollars that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:20.880" style="s2">kind of an absurd</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:22.960" style="s2">thing it&#39;s like oh no because we got to</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.880" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">negotiate they want this so we want this</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s like by the way the thing we</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:29.440" style="s2">want you also want it&#39;s bipartisan</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">legislation like let me give you an</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.440" end="01:08:32.719" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.839" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">the restart act it&#39;s basically more</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.719" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">targeted ppp funding</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:38.719" style="s2">we would spend money on that tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.719" end="01:08:42.239" style="s2">all and democrats would vote for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">republicans would vote for it</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">um i need nancy pelosi to bring that to</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:47.359" style="s2">the floor</p>

<p begin="01:08:51.600" end="01:08:56.480" style="s2">just i&#39;m sure she does not like me</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">but uh but uh i was like why don&#39;t we</p>

<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:09.279" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t give you leverage for the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.040" end="01:09:12.000" style="s2">for the other stuff you want and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.279" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">why that&#39;s gross that&#39;s not patriotic</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.000" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like we agree on it and just you</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:16.960" style="s2">can argue with this about all bills and</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:18.400" style="s2">i&#39;m sure republicans have done the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.960" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">thing i just wasn&#39;t in congress</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.400" end="01:09:22.960" style="s2">you know so um</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">and they did but honestly i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.960" end="01:09:28.480" style="s2">it was to the same extent like</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.199" end="01:09:30.239" style="s2">if you get there all of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.480" end="01:09:31.759" style="s2">major bills that get pushed through</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.239" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">they&#39;re very easy for me to argue</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.759" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">against</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:35.600" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to make them that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">easy for me to argue against you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.600" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">this is what i do i create these here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">the truth videos i say like why i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.159" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">voting for this why it&#39;s bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">why it&#39;s bad policy don&#39;t vote for this</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">even though it has a nice sounding name</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:49.359" style="s2">they always have a nice sounding name</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:51.040" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.359" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">they the democrats could make it very</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.040" end="01:09:54.000" style="s2">hard for me to vote against that they</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.120" end="01:09:56.480" style="s2">could they could strip</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.000" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">out some like like 10 of what&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.480" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">they could strip out the poison pills</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">and we could just vote on stuff we agree</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.000" end="01:10:03.600" style="s2">on the senate would vote on it it would</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:04.239" style="s2">go to the president&#39;s desk he would sign</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.600" end="01:10:06.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.239" end="01:10:07.520" style="s2">you could do that it&#39;s not it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.159" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">very easy</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.520" end="01:10:12.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just a decision that has to happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.080" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.080" end="01:10:15.920" style="s2">you know that simple thing you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:17.440" style="s2">need to change the superstructure of</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.920" end="01:10:18.640" style="s2">who&#39;s going to run for president right</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.440" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.640" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">just vote for discrete solutions for</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:24.719" style="s2">discrete problems</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:26.400" style="s2">you know and and some people call for</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.719" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">this often right like the the one</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.400" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">issue voting i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:33.360" style="s2">right answer either because</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">like that would take just a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.360" end="01:10:37.040" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s okay to just have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:38.320" style="s2">bipartisan negotiation and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.040" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.320" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">sometimes um it&#39;s happened a few times</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:44.800" style="s2">throughout this session</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:46.880" style="s2">like on big stuff it happens every day</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.800" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">on little stuff that nobody knows about</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.880" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:52.560" style="s2">but uh on the big stuff like informing</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:54.080" style="s2">retirement savings for instance like</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.560" end="01:10:54.880" style="s2">that was a big one the first step act</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.080" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.880" end="01:10:58.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a decent one i mean you could</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">argue the cares act is you know it</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.960" end="01:11:02.640" style="s2">happened that way</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:04.960" style="s2">but the police reform bill that easily</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.640" end="01:11:06.640" style="s2">that was not very far apart</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.960" end="01:11:08.640" style="s2">it easily could have just because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:10.320" style="s2">always like hey fine you want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.640" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">do all that fine but please just do a</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.320" end="01:11:16.159" style="s2">little bit less but you know i</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.040" end="01:11:16.560" style="s2">we&#39;re agreeing that on the action but</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.159" end="01:11:18.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.560" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">just just don&#39;t spend three times as</p>

<p begin="01:11:21.040" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">you know it and if we agree on</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:27.679" style="s2">everything at that</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:29.679" style="s2">80 percent level i it&#39;s hard to argue</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.679" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">against why why would one just pass that</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.679" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">and especially with something like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2">restart act again</p>

<p begin="01:11:34.000" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">extremely important so</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t even need two</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:41.920" style="s2">candidates in the presidency to</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">you know differing sides for this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.920" end="01:11:46.960" style="s2">just a that&#39;s a simple solution</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:48.239" style="s2">well i hate to say it and i hate to say</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.960" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">it to you of all people</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.239" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">but this really is the point is that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:54.400" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">the mystery you point to about why we</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.400" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">just don&#39;t simply do the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:58.960" style="s2">obviously at the public&#39;s interest and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:02.480" style="s2">that would be popular</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.960" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">is because the system is built to serve</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.480" end="01:12:07.040" style="s2">a different interest that its real</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:08.719" style="s2">constituents aren&#39;t the public and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.040" end="01:12:11.120" style="s2">the public is i mean this has now been</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.719" end="01:12:14.719" style="s2">established through research that</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.120" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">um the public&#39;s desire for policy has</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.719" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">almost no influence</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">over what legislation we pass that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">know the public</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.000" end="01:12:24.000" style="s2">is uh playing a role in that game</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s votes</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:29.679" style="s2">a portion power between the parties but</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:31.520" style="s2">the public&#39;s well-being is not the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.679" end="01:12:32.080" style="s2">purpose of policy at this point and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.520" end="01:12:34.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.080" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">that&#39;s deeply unpatriotic it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.400" end="01:12:37.199" style="s2">solvable</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:39.520" style="s2">problem but it can&#39;t be solved if we</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.199" end="01:12:40.800" style="s2">subscribe to the rules we&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.520" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">we have to stick to</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.800" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">which is exactly why unity 2020 exists</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">and why something</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.440" end="01:12:49.520" style="s2">like it must exist yeah and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">reasons that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.520" end="01:12:53.199" style="s2">that&#39;s true also is now having been in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:54.800" style="s2">politics for</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.199" end="01:12:56.239" style="s2">a pretty short amount of time and kind</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.800" end="01:12:58.320" style="s2">of seeing</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.239" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">what incentives do we respond to as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.320" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">politician</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.280" end="01:13:04.320" style="s2">um it&#39;s really simple it&#39;s it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">votes like you you need</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.320" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">you need your constituents to devote you</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">back in so you have to do something you</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:12.640" style="s2">have to do things that they like</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">at least 51 of the time um</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.640" end="01:13:17.120" style="s2">that&#39;s always fundamentally true i know</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:18.880" style="s2">a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.120" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">put a lot more weight on like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.880" end="01:13:23.520" style="s2">lobbyist interests and all that</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:25.600" style="s2">in my very limited experience that has</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.520" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">that has a lot less weight</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.600" end="01:13:29.040" style="s2">um you know the the lobbyists in</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:31.760" style="s2">washington provide a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.040" end="01:13:33.760" style="s2">they&#39;re like a they&#39;re they provide</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.760" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">details that you would never know about</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.760" end="01:13:37.679" style="s2">for a given industry and you know it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:40.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.679" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">conniving ill intention there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.880" end="01:13:44.000" style="s2">you know we it&#39;s good that we know these</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:45.679" style="s2">things because</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.000" end="01:13:47.120" style="s2">these industries tend to employ hundreds</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.679" end="01:13:50.320" style="s2">of thousands of people so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.120" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">it&#39;s okay for us to know that um i</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.320" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">i&#39;ve never i don&#39;t see them holding a</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.000" style="s2">lot of sway uh because they also compete</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:58.640" style="s2">with one another too so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.000" end="01:14:00.560" style="s2">you know and your job as a politician</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.640" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">with good judgments to be like are you</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.560" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">bsing me or you because you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:07.360" style="s2">that&#39;s your job figure it out and um and</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:09.280" style="s2">figure out like what&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.360" end="01:14:10.800" style="s2">going to do for for my constituents and</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.280" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.800" end="01:14:15.920" style="s2">i i guess you might fear that some group</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:17.360" style="s2">hates you so much</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.920" end="01:14:19.840" style="s2">that they might spend a lot of money in</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.360" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">your district but that&#39;s also very rare</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.840" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">um that more happens when that does</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:26.239" style="s2">happen from say a super pac it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s funded by one person it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.239" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s billionaires on one side</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.920" end="01:14:30.480" style="s2">versus billionaires on another side and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.760" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.480" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t really have a problem with that</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s competing um i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:37.120" style="s2">to stop that without truly infringing on</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.760" end="01:14:38.560" style="s2">people&#39;s rights to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.120" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">to free speech maybe there should be</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.560" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">more transparency behind it i think we</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.239" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">would all agree on that um</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.360" style="s2">but but there is in fact people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:47.280" style="s2">realize how much</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.360" end="01:14:49.040" style="s2">there actually is with super pacs the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.280" end="01:14:52.239" style="s2">donors are known</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.040" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">so you know i guess what i&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.239" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">is so okay so why won&#39;t pelosi</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">put that stuff on the floor and</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">because i guess maybe because</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">everybody&#39;s first election is a primary</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:11.520" style="s2">you know maybe that&#39;s it um</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">maybe because the loudest voices tend to</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.520" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">tend to have the most influence and</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:18.480" style="s2">the um the there&#39;s a graph um</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:20.000" style="s2">one of my political science teachers</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.480" end="01:15:23.679" style="s2">drew for us</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.000" end="01:15:26.960" style="s2">and uh it was very insightful and it was</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.679" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">the um uh it was the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.960" end="01:15:31.120" style="s2">the word so think of it this way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to visualize but</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.120" end="01:15:35.920" style="s2">try it&#39;s think of like a smiley face</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.760" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">graph so that kind of bell curve</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.920" end="01:15:39.520" style="s2">all right and what is what does that uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:42.640" style="s2">represent and</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.520" end="01:15:45.679" style="s2">and so on the x-axis you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.640" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">you know the left and the right okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.679" end="01:15:52.719" style="s2">and i almost need to draw it to</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.520" end="01:15:54.000" style="s2">to like describe it correctly but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.719" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.000" end="01:15:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:15:59.840" style="s2">describe</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.120" end="01:16:01.280" style="s2">a simple fact which is that the people</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.840" end="01:16:03.440" style="s2">in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.280" end="01:16:04.560" style="s2">by nature of being in the middle are not</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.440" end="01:16:07.440" style="s2">very passionate</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.560" end="01:16:08.960" style="s2">about a given policy you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.440" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">more likely to say i mean that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.960" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">makes sense and i mean that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:14.960" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:18.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um people on the fringes</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.960" end="01:16:20.880" style="s2">are far more likely to to be extremely</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.239" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">loud about a policy be highly passionate</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.880" end="01:16:24.560" style="s2">and this is the voices that get heard in</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.800" end="01:16:26.560" style="s2">politics and this is what politicians</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.560" end="01:16:28.400" style="s2">have to respond to because these people</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.679" style="s2">these people influence that whether we</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.400" end="01:16:31.360" style="s2">like it or not</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:32.800" style="s2">those people in the fringes influence</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.360" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">the people in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.800" end="01:16:36.080" style="s2">because the people in the middle have</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">again they have a disposition even if</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:39.199" style="s2">you&#39;re an independent</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:40.880" style="s2">everybody has a disposition on a</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.199" end="01:16:43.440" style="s2">spectrum of left to right</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.880" end="01:16:45.520" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s psychologically true</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.440" end="01:16:47.920" style="s2">we&#39;re wired a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.520" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">and so you trust even though you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.920" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not like i don&#39;t like the way</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:52.719" style="s2">those radical conservatives are talking</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">but i still trust them more</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.719" end="01:16:56.400" style="s2">um to kind of kind of know the direction</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">that i kind of want to go</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.400" end="01:16:59.840" style="s2">and so i&#39;m with that and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:00.960" style="s2">mad and they&#39;re really passionate and so</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.840" end="01:17:01.440" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to know what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.960" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.440" end="01:17:04.480" style="s2">so this gets to another cultural problem</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:06.080" style="s2">we have where i think we&#39;ve associated</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.480" end="01:17:08.080" style="s2">passion with sophistication</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.080" end="01:17:09.520" style="s2">a little bit too much like oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.080" end="01:17:10.640" style="s2">they&#39;re so angry they must have a good</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.520" end="01:17:13.040" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.640" end="01:17:15.040" style="s2">do they though you know like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.040" end="01:17:17.199" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s i&#39;m not so sure</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.040" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">um you know somebody&#39;s people just rile</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.199" end="01:17:20.480" style="s2">themselves up or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.719" end="01:17:22.400" style="s2">faking it um but i think it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.480" end="01:17:24.159" style="s2">telling yourself a narrative of anger</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.400" end="01:17:26.159" style="s2">over and over again and then you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.159" end="01:17:27.360" style="s2">you actually tend to believe it but</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.159" end="01:17:29.120" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.360" end="01:17:30.880" style="s2">and so that&#39;s what politicians end up</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.120" end="01:17:33.199" style="s2">responding to and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.880" end="01:17:35.199" style="s2">again we only fear our voters that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.199" end="01:17:37.760" style="s2">that&#39;s all we actually fear</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.199" end="01:17:39.520" style="s2">um and i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.760" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">know of anybody who&#39;s any different</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.520" end="01:17:45.760" style="s2">you know i i haven&#39;t i haven&#39;t seen this</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:47.280" style="s2">sort of corrupt behavior that i think</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.760" end="01:17:48.000" style="s2">people envision a lot i&#39;m not saying it</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:50.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.000" end="01:17:51.440" style="s2">i haven&#39;t been up there a long long long</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.080" end="01:17:53.840" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.440" end="01:17:54.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s um it&#39;s not quite what people</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.840" end="01:17:56.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.480" end="01:17:58.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t think more complicated it</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.480" end="01:18:00.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look the way we expect</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">it to look you know this it&#39;s a banality</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.159" end="01:18:04.000" style="s2">of evil phenomenon where</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:06.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look very dramatic at all</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.000" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">right the consequences of it are ghastly</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.480" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">in my opinion but</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">the actual way that it functions looks</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:15.360" style="s2">like business</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:19.360" style="s2">and you know why won&#39;t pelosi bring</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.360" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">obviously good legislation um</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.360" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">the answer is because obviously good</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:25.840" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:26.080" style="s2">is not in her interest and it&#39;s not in</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.840" end="01:18:29.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.080" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">interests of the dnc and it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.360" end="01:18:32.960" style="s2">interests</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:36.000" style="s2">of the real constituents of the party</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.960" end="01:18:39.840" style="s2">and we can only read that</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.000" end="01:18:40.480" style="s2">indirectly by the failure decade after</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.840" end="01:18:43.840" style="s2">decade</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.480" end="01:18:45.760" style="s2">to do the obvious right</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.840" end="01:18:46.960" style="s2">yeah so so on that particular question i</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.760" end="01:18:48.480" style="s2">actually because i have an answer so</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.960" end="01:18:50.400" style="s2">this is how i see this play out</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.480" end="01:18:51.600" style="s2">i&#39;m just on this on this specific bill</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.400" end="01:18:53.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.600" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s pretty obvious that pelosi won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.360" end="01:18:55.920" style="s2">bring that to the floor because then</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:57.840" style="s2">trump will sign it and he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.920" end="01:18:59.679" style="s2">he&#39;ll run a victory lap and that&#39;ll make</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.840" end="01:19:00.960" style="s2">her very mad and it&#39;ll look good he</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.679" end="01:19:02.719" style="s2">might get reelected</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.960" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly why it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:07.120" style="s2">get put to the floor</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:08.640" style="s2">now now but the question is is like why</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.120" end="01:19:09.920" style="s2">if it&#39;s good for everybody why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.640" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2">they hold her accountable</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.920" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the question and so and so and</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.400" end="01:19:16.000" style="s2">here&#39;s the answer and i see it play out</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:18.719" style="s2">like on twitter okay i see it play out</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.000" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">on the commentary which is pelosi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.719" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">defending us and i&#39;ll see people say</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:25.600" style="s2">she&#39;s defending us by by waiting for a</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:27.120" style="s2">better deal she&#39;s looking out for us</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.600" end="01:19:29.440" style="s2">like people believe this</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.120" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">so she&#39;s responding to her constituents</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:33.280" style="s2">in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:34.840" style="s2">because they trust her now i disagree</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.280" end="01:19:37.280" style="s2">with that logic</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.840" end="01:19:39.280" style="s2">clearly but i but i at least can observe</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.280" end="01:19:42.960" style="s2">what&#39;s what i see to be happening here</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.280" end="01:19:43.520" style="s2">well uh i&#39;m more cynical than you are</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.960" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.520" end="01:19:46.719" style="s2">this question maybe because i&#39;m older</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:51.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.719" end="01:19:55.280" style="s2">um i watched the democratic party</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.840" end="01:19:58.480" style="s2">sabotage bernie sanders in 2016</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.280" end="01:19:59.120" style="s2">because it preferred trump and the whole</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.480" end="01:20:02.080" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.120" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">it also decried the possibility of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.080" end="01:20:04.000" style="s2">election of trump and then the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:06.560" style="s2">the election</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.000" end="01:20:08.400" style="s2">of trump as you know the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.560" end="01:20:11.760" style="s2">the end of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.400" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">and none of it made any sense this is</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.760" end="01:20:16.320" style="s2">really about</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:19.199" style="s2">the fact that um bernie sanders</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.320" end="01:20:20.800" style="s2">for better or worse was a challenge to</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.199" end="01:20:22.880" style="s2">standard operating procedure in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.800" end="01:20:24.400" style="s2">democratic party he was not supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.880" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.400" end="01:20:32.800" style="s2">a viable candidate in the primary and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">the thing that that does not get said</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.800" end="01:20:36.320" style="s2">is that donald trump was as they viewed</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.320" end="01:20:39.840" style="s2">less of a threat to the things that were</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">important to the functioning of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.840" end="01:20:44.080" style="s2">party than bernie sanders was</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:44.560" style="s2">because although i find bernie sanders</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.080" end="01:20:47.679" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.560" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">of what policies we should enact to be</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.679" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">backward looking he did in fact want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:57.120" style="s2">things in a way that a</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:58.560" style="s2">status quo based dnc just couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.120" end="01:21:01.040" style="s2">tolerate</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.560" end="01:21:02.719" style="s2">yeah but i always give bernie that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.040" end="01:21:05.760" style="s2">genuine oh yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.719" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">absolutely he&#39;s a real patriot yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.760" end="01:21:10.080" style="s2">yeah but i disagree with him on</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:12.560" style="s2">literally everything oh that&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.080" end="01:21:14.320" style="s2">but but he&#39;s but he&#39;s genuine he he</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.560" end="01:21:15.520" style="s2">believes what he believes that is that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.320" end="01:21:17.440" style="s2">has always been true about bernie</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.520" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">sanders um he has flip-flopped on some</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.440" end="01:21:20.800" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:22.080" style="s2">which um he used to be a true socialist</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.800" end="01:21:24.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.080" end="01:21:25.360" style="s2">which means you have to be a nationalist</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:28.400" style="s2">this is important because</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.360" end="01:21:30.560" style="s2">like you kind of have to be if you the</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.400" end="01:21:31.120" style="s2">open border policy of the new democratic</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.560" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.120" end="01:21:36.400" style="s2">is is not what bernie sanders was in</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">favor of in 2015. he said so he was very</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.400" end="01:21:41.679" style="s2">clear about this um again because if</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:43.840" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have a welfare state</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.679" end="01:21:46.400" style="s2">then you also have to have borders in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.840" end="01:21:49.520" style="s2">very strict immigration system</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.400" end="01:21:51.840" style="s2">so you can&#39;t have both um</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.520" end="01:21:53.199" style="s2">it&#39;s impossible because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.840" end="01:21:56.560" style="s2">arguing with that</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.199" end="01:21:58.880" style="s2">sweden can do it um they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.560" end="01:22:00.159" style="s2">having trouble because they&#39;ve gotten a</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:02.719" style="s2">lot of immigration</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.159" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">but they have a super tight-knit social</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.719" end="01:22:05.199" style="s2">fabric it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">just a very different can&#39;t even compare</p>

<p begin="01:23:27.360" end="01:23:30.639" style="s2">rambling on</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:32.560" style="s2">well i was i was alleging the deep</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.639" end="01:23:34.719" style="s2">corruption of the dnc and i must say</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.560" end="01:23:36.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not like i think the rnc</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:39.120" style="s2">is less corrupt in fact i could make an</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.960" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">argument that the dnc</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.120" end="01:23:42.719" style="s2">learned its game from the rnc but the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:44.960" style="s2">rnc is</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.719" end="01:23:46.639" style="s2">less worthy of that discussion at the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.960" end="01:23:50.159" style="s2">moment because</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.639" end="01:23:52.880" style="s2">trump actually beat it right</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.159" end="01:23:54.560" style="s2">sanders stood a chance of beating the</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.880" end="01:23:56.400" style="s2">dnc but he failed to</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.560" end="01:23:58.080" style="s2">but donald trump actually did so in some</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.400" end="01:23:59.120" style="s2">sense you know at least something new</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.080" end="01:24:00.239" style="s2">and different has happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.120" end="01:24:03.440" style="s2">republican party</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.239" end="01:24:06.560" style="s2">um that has changed the dynamic um</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.440" end="01:24:10.080" style="s2">i i you know i&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.560" end="01:24:12.400" style="s2">uh donald trump&#39;s leadership</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.080" end="01:24:14.159" style="s2">style and the hazard that it creates for</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.400" end="01:24:15.920" style="s2">the nation and the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.159" end="01:24:18.159" style="s2">but he did demonstrate that it was</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.920" end="01:24:20.639" style="s2">possible um to</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.159" end="01:24:21.520" style="s2">to gain the presidency in spite of</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.639" end="01:24:24.320" style="s2">opposition</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.520" end="01:24:25.120" style="s2">from the highest echelons of the party</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.320" end="01:24:27.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.120" end="01:24:29.040" style="s2">um that was an important lesson and you</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.520" end="01:24:31.520" style="s2">know it&#39;s one that</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.040" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">uh i think we should learn from anyway i</p>
