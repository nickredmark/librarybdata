<p begin="00:15:46.350" end="00:15:50.640" style="s2">and it was sterling in the dollar but</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.089" end="00:15:53.370" style="s2">they were both anchored to gold and in</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:46.290" style="s2">where people just totally lose faith on</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.950" end="00:16:48.450" style="s2">paper currencies go to hard assets and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.290" end="00:16:49.649" style="s2">we have a sequential collapse of paper</p>

<p begin="00:16:49.649" end="00:16:53.010" style="s2">point governments will have to react</p>

<p begin="00:23:42.010" end="00:23:46.990" style="s2">so to that merchants checking account it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.650" end="00:23:49.080" style="s2">all looks the same and those dollars</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.990" end="00:23:51.610" style="s2">that you created stay in circulation</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.080" end="00:23:54.430" style="s2">until somebody saves them up and pays</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.610" end="00:23:57.370" style="s2">down credit card debt so unpaid credit</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.430" end="00:24:01.780" style="s2">card balances I include as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.370" end="00:24:03.730" style="s2">cash in circulation and in 1971 Nixon</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.780" end="00:24:05.770" style="s2">took us off the gold standard and gold</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.730" end="00:24:08.440" style="s2">became a freely traded separate</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.260" end="00:24:14.440" style="s2">was quite a while here where we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:16.180" style="s2">have gone back on the gold standard the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.440" end="00:24:19.150" style="s2">value of the gold of the Treasury</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.180" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">exceeded all the dollars printed from</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.260" end="00:24:31.420" style="s2">exceeded out base money plus outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:35.740" style="s2">revolving credit so here&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.420" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">chart again that was to 1985 and now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.740" end="00:24:42.580" style="s2">going to take it out to today and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:45.250" style="s2">there&#39;s that 1980 peak where it&#39;s shot</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.580" end="00:24:47.530" style="s2">past base money and base money plus</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.250" end="00:24:49.500" style="s2">outstanding revolving credit and then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.530" end="00:24:52.140" style="s2">get to the crisis of o8</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.500" end="00:24:53.640" style="s2">and ben bernanke oh by the way instead</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.140" end="00:24:57.150" style="s2">of billions we&#39;re now measuring in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.640" end="00:24:58.560" style="s2">trillions so we started in millions and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.150" end="00:25:01.470" style="s2">then it went to billions and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.560" end="00:25:03.750" style="s2">trillions so we did the bailouts and all</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.470" end="00:25:05.820" style="s2">the quantitative easing and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:08.760" style="s2">the currency supply looks like today and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.820" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">then they announced quantitative easing</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.760" end="00:25:14.670" style="s2">3 which is that 85 billion a month that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:17.210" style="s2">they&#39;re creating and they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.670" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">going to have to do it until about 2015</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.210" end="00:25:23.940" style="s2">so here&#39;s the projection for gold</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:26.130" style="s2">covering the currency supply today would</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.940" end="00:25:30.390" style="s2">be thirteen thousand four hundred</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:40.380" style="s2">eighty and believe me</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.770" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">it shocked people in nineteen in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.380" end="00:25:46.260" style="s2">1970s when gold was $35 an ounce and</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.470" end="00:25:52.830" style="s2">down because now there was going to be</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.550" end="00:26:11.700" style="s2">took about six thousand dollars an ounce</p>
