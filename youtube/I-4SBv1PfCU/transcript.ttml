<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">immediately hooked</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">um i find bonita&#39;s teachings to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:14.959" style="s2">incredibly insightful she&#39;s super well</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">informed about</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.959" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">various sense making modalities and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">complexity theory and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">systems theory informed sense that many</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">of us are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">but she also adds um an element</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:34.840" style="s2">of what i would call a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">or non-dual embodied</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.840" end="00:02:40.319" style="s2">participatory knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">um when i when i got to know her work i</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.319" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">was just so impressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">um epistemologically it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">incredible compared to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">more um conceptual framework since</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:56.560" style="s2">making frameworks that are out there so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">i&#39;m so excited to be here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">i will let bonita talk about what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:03.519" style="s2">holo</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">is and um introduce the session</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.519" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">um i assume we will be having a q a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.400" end="00:03:08.800" style="s2">portion</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">and for that portion just put your</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.800" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">questions in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:16.560" style="s2">um prefix them with cue or question</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">um so that i can see them plus one if</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.560" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">you think a question is good</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">and i will field those questions</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">metaphor and image where you think of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">like the pre-revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">uh soldier people going into the hollow</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">to discuss the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">and here in connecticut we have what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">called the charter oak</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">where our original charter uh for</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.480" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">uh connecticut um was was</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">hidden inside the hollow of a tree um</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:00.239" style="s2">hollows are these ravines where you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">at night or</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.239" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">pre-dawn uh so to be to be secret group</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">of revolutionaries um and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s great to have this run into</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:17.040" style="s2">halloween uh so um</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">i want to frame this a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.040" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">different ways uh this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">this uh series is an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">because one of the things we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">to or i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">or we&#39;re all trying to do is talk less</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">about something</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">and immerse into it so i could blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">blah</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">on the difference between cross</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">paradigmatic multi-paradigmatic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:46.080" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic i teach primarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:48.479" style="s2">for all my workshops are designed for</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.800" style="s2">postal formal learners</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.479" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">and post-formal learners are somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.800" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:05:00.000" style="s2">this arena so cross-paradigmatic means</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">i can sit inside of science</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.000" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">and look at philosophy or i could sit</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">inside of structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">and look at science right so i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:14.560" style="s2">crossing from the i have one paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:17.039" style="s2">where i&#39;m looking at the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.560" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">and you see this happening primarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.039" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.320" style="s2">in the sense making space this level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.320" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll have multi-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">often called trans</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">paradigmatic but it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">multi-paradigmatic means</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">yeah i could enter in quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">this framework with you</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">let&#39;s enter into complexity theory let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">enter into metapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:44.479" style="s2">so i have the ability to occupy</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.600" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">many different paradigms and live there</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">and you see</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:48.960" style="s2">also see this as part of the skill you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">all have</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.960" end="00:05:53.880" style="s2">in taking and taking these video you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">know these videos here you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.880" end="00:05:59.039" style="s2">multi-paradigmatic or else you&#39;d just be</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">complaining you know that you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.039" end="00:06:04.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:06.080" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to try to do here is uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.840" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.080" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">that means you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">actually entering into these paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">as if they were separate worlds</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">but you&#39;re actually kind of having some</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">experience of them melting into each</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">and part of this experience in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">post-formal learning</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:36.160" style="s2">is very synesthetic visual</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">if you can use a lot of multimedia to to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.160" end="00:06:40.479" style="s2">encourage and invite the mind not to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">clamp down and jump</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.479" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">into a paradigm but experience as</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">if you&#39;re the sun and there&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">constellations of worlds</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">um that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s the last definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">hollow you have to kind of keep your</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">mind hollow so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">interplay of paradigms you know so then</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.720" style="s2">you say well where are you coming from</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">and what we&#39;re hoping is that where</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.720" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">is emerges through takes on a new shape</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">so this is uh the conceptual framing</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">of what we&#39;re going to do to to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">um and obviously it&#39;s very experimental</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">but i think you all are up for it so let</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">me share my screen</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">oh let me say this so the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:33.520" style="s2">going to do this is i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">present in this kind of trans</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.520" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">paradigmatic way</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">uh the the first screen is not like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s another frame but then we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">to get into this transparent</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">presentation um and then for the q a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">we can come back down to conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">rationality for questions so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">mentalize or or get our get our uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">really be able to chew into some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">concepts so it&#39;s not like the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">just to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">to not hone in on some uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:06.800" style="s2">uh teaching points so the question in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.800" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">could be more rigorous in a conventional</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">way all right</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">so what we are going to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">is this slide is to remind us</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:32.399" style="s2">of what&#39;s in the sense making series</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:35.680" style="s2">this is kind of an interesting slide</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.399" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">of a civilization that&#39;s come and gone</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.680" end="00:08:39.440" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">here&#39;s a remnant of a civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.440" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">there is this sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">that we are working in the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">se</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">seen with uh being on the verge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">bifurcation events catastrophic collapse</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">time in between worlds so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">enter into</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">this mean space that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">holding a lot of what we do here at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">store</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:10.640" style="s2">right so this is a slide of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">some kind of remembrance</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.640" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">what we&#39;re going to talk about today is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">ta or over this series are the way we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">have our metaphysics how modern minds</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">construe time change and causality</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">and that in my opinion these have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">change to different types</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">of mental models in order for us</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">to move beyond modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.240" style="s2">post-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:52.000" style="s2">so a lot of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.240" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">about civilization collapse</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.000" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">metapsychology etc is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">but for me as long as it&#39;s inside the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">same paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">that depends upon modernity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">notion of time modernity&#39;s motion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">and modernity&#39;s notion of causality i</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s radical enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">i just this is gonna the hypothesis in</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:25.120" style="s2">slideshow in the whole series so</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at these specifically and see</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.120" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">see if these are actually changing in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">um how does this fit into the some of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">the other sense making series</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">um some of the sense making series uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:44.240" style="s2">have a geohistorical frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:46.079" style="s2">so we talk about globalism and the rise</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.240" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">of neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.079" end="00:10:50.920" style="s2">uh media the internet exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">and climate i would call that a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.920" end="00:10:55.040" style="s2">geo-historical frame</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at time change and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.040" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">causality</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:01.839" style="s2">inside this geo-historical frame others</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">have a developmental frame the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.839" end="00:11:06.000" style="s2">development of the human</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">so we have cultural complexity cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.000" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">complexity</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">and psychologically complexity and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">also have</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">a a modern notion of time</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">change and causality we&#39;re going to look</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">um change we&#39;re going to look at sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">making from an evolutionary frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.880" style="s2">and with evolution it&#39;s a directionless</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.880" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">right so in the geohistorical frame in</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">the developmental frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:35.440" style="s2">you&#39;re always kind of your your notion</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">of causality is always from here</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.440" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">to better development better progress</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:42.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s kind of a linear</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">trajectory or direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.480" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming for but an evolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a direction</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna try to think of sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">as a directionless change that happens</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.959" style="s2">that something we can&#39;t know beforehand</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">or explain afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.959" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">but something we can learn how to do so</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:08.880" style="s2">the great apocalypse changes in history</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">like people learning how</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.880" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">having language symbolic language nobody</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.519" style="s2">knew how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:16.639" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t sense make your way into</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.120" style="s2">learning language</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.639" end="00:12:19.839" style="s2">it&#39;s evolutionary change that happens to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.120" end="00:12:22.839" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.839" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">so this is kind of a different way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.839" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">hold um</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">the framing that we&#39;re using now the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">is um with an evolutionary frame</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2">your by you have bifurcation events</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:43.360" style="s2">that change the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">thought beforehand and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.360" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">afterwards so it&#39;s very hard to use</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">the exis the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:57.519" style="s2">sense that we make in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.399" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">to predict the sense we will make</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.519" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">after modernity because sense making</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">evolves so for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">in the magical mind in the epic that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:12.560" style="s2">geps are called magical</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.560" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">they didn&#39;t like try to go out</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">have common shared explanatory systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">the magical structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">the the way we would call sense making</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">is just what works</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">what works is ritualized in collective</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">mimetic behavior</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:32.480" style="s2">because what doesn&#39;t work dies out</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">people don&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.480" end="00:13:38.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s their sense making frame</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">they never said why does it work with</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.560" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">the mythical</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">structure of consciousness you start to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">have this question why does it work</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.120" style="s2">and you get a narrative story or a myth</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">about why it works</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.120" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">but there&#39;s no empirical correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">why does the sun shine because zeus gets</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:57.519" style="s2">in his chariot you know this does not</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">a really a one-to-one correspondence but</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.519" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">you see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">question of why comes up in the mythical</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">in the mental structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.600" style="s2">is the modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">way we think of sense making so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.600" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">asking to step back and think even</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">sense making even asking like why can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">make sense of the world or we should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">making</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">has a specific evolutionary apocalyp</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">time frame of modernity so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">really big</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">you really have to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:37.279" style="s2">understand this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">you want this very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.279" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">metacognitive perspective on this or a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">transparent dramatic</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:44.959" style="s2">so in mental structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">and modernity</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.959" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">sense making for us is shared</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:51.680" style="s2">explanations of how</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">how it works in order to predict aside</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.680" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">and control outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">right so the question i just want you to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:04.000" style="s2">feel into in in just for a short moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">is when did the world stop making sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.000" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:10.839" style="s2">and when you feel in that you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">understand what making sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.839" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.160" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">that you lost something or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">the loss of shared shared explanations</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">or the loss</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:34.639" style="s2">of predictability and control</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">or the loss of something right so when</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.639" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">did the world stop making sense for you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:43.759" style="s2">and what does making sense to you mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.000" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">you still have the bible story</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">right that would be a mythic explanation</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">what was removed from that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:08.959" style="s2">now another thing i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.720" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">modernity is modernity has not made</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">for a lot of people ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.360" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">okay it doesn&#39;t didn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense for the orangutan and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.279" style="s2">the palm forest of course that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">person it doesn&#39;t make sense for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.279" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">camera</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">people that sort you know live through</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">world war one in world war</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">ii doesn&#39;t make sense for the people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">the holocaust it doesn&#39;t make sense for</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.320" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">homeless people it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">for a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">for a lot of people modernity has never</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">made sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">this is just true this is just true</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.560" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">and for some people like a 14 year old</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">girl in africa who just graduated from</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:52.880" style="s2">school and started</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:54.560" style="s2">an ngo it&#39;s just now beginning to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.880" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.560" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">in this notion of sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">so we have to get a really very clear</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:06.799" style="s2">on what we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">talking about the war on sense making</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.799" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">for many people modernity has never made</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">so this too is an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.400" end="00:17:22.240" style="s2">metamorphing kind of game</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">so this is the framework in which this</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">operates in it&#39;s much different</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:39.600" style="s2">than my work is really much different</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">than a lot of other people in this space</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:46.039" style="s2">but i want to really</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">enable you to enter into this</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.039" end="00:17:49.039" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">view of what we&#39;re going to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.360" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i&#39;m not able to read the chat</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.480" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">uh and do this at the same time so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">you see something come up that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">needs clarification in the chat just uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">shout it out</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s um that&#39;s all framing</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:27.440" style="s2">enter this uh oh i think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">more thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">so in the end so where are we going</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">i want to give you the goal when we</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">start because</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">the in-between is kind of confusing</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">i&#39;m going to predict that sense making</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.320" style="s2">modern sense is shifting from sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.320" end="00:18:50.000" style="s2">to sense fullness</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">i could ramble on for hours about why i</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:56.640" style="s2">think that&#39;s the case but i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">to do a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.640" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">kind of evidential</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:06.400" style="s2">thing here but that&#39;s where i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.400" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">and that we are moving from an</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.240" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.280" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">which is how we try to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">things now</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">and that&#39;s in the past that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:20.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">trying to make sense in a magical sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.160" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">that that i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:28.480" style="s2">is not recoverable and that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">because i think we&#39;re moving to an</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.480" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">understanding and relational</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">intimacy what i call senseful</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">co-presence this is why yankaporta</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">is is interesting again and all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.760" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">you see all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">moves toward what looks like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:46.720" style="s2">pre-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a hybridization to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.720" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">so i just give you the end at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">beginning so you can see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of uh narrative arc</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">in this presentation so we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">uh we can talk about this in the q a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what the q a</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">is for but we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">um unpack that right now i think you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">get kind of get a hit of what that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">and i think if you think about it you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">see this is leaking in</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">already you can see these moves</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">and me frankly i don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">to spend my time in the information</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">commons and shared explanation space i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">a i&#39;m a future junkie</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:41.360" style="s2">all my energy is in like okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">irrevocably past</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.360" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">can we can we support can we birth</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">what wants to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:04.159" style="s2">so for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.960" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">the meta in meta modern this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.159" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">the our sense making space</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">must point to the ability to take a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">on both modernity and post-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">now i leap i lump those two together</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">because they both come from the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">metaphysics of time change and causality</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:28.720" style="s2">one&#39;s a critique on the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">but they assume the same modern</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:34.000" style="s2">categories of time change and causality</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">so to me they&#39;re the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.000" end="00:21:38.000" style="s2">and to go meta on that in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">this trans-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.000" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">is to be able to examine it as if from</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.840" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.720" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:52.000" style="s2">question is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:56.320" style="s2">where is the without how can we get</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.000" end="00:21:59.360" style="s2">out of modernity and post modernity</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.320" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">able to examine it and talk about it and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.360" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">this is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">a little slide that kind of illustrates</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">for me that modernity and post-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">are in a metaphysical loop</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">because they rely on the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">primary categories metaphysical primes</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:21.679" style="s2">change and causality and if you change</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">them you&#39;ve changed everything</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.679" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">we can we can look in the past and see</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">our evolutionary anthropology that</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">these conceptions have changed</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re changing again</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">so for me to be sufficiently meta and</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">metamodern</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">is not just to be a next move on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">modernity post-modernity line</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s to categorically change</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">these metaphysical primes and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">let them go</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">so we can look back in time</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">and see that cultural artifacts art oral</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">history philosophy religion and science</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">can be read as dispatches from the times</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">so instead of looking at them and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">them as</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">past over</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">done with that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">a modern way of looking at time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">passed it&#39;s over it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">we can look at them as that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">written in stone</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.039" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">to speak to us as modern people</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">you see the difference so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:38.960" style="s2">looking at them as</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">another time they&#39;re dead they&#39;re over</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.679" end="00:23:49.840" style="s2">written in stone to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">us as modern people there</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.840" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">the text is only relevant now</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.880" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">and this is what gemster saw this is how</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">the buddhists think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">you know um maybe the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:04.799" style="s2">they thought of the torah and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">buddhists think of these secret texts</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.799" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">they are dispatches from their times</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">we see there were times of deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">apocalypse change when one form of human</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.320" style="s2">consciousness was replaced by another so</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">what they&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.320" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">us is look you were different before</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">we were different before</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">we see periods of in betweenness when</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">the old structure no longer work</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">but the new structure is not yet to come</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">and i would argue this</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">is we&#39;re in a period of in between now</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">so what we could do is dispatch what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">feels like to be here</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">to our future selves</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.640" style="s2">that what we write and what we say and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">what we do at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.640" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">is a record dispatch to our future</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">selves and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">only they will be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">it but not in the way we make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">things but in the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">they are making sense of things so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">is a way to really get into like</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">post-formal learning like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.559" style="s2">these creative imaginaries you get out</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">of the time frame</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.559" end="00:25:10.159" style="s2">a past present and future and you start</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.159" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">create imaginary worlds that could be</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">so just like we look in the past and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">don&#39;t instead of saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s done and over with let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">archaeologists about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:30.799" style="s2">we can look into the past as if</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">it&#39;s speaking to us this is who you were</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.799" end="00:25:36.159" style="s2">this is what we wanted you to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">and then we can imagine ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.159" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">time in between where we&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:41.840" style="s2">sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.520" style="s2">and what we write and what we think and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">all the confusion we are in</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.520" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">are actually dispatches to our future</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">selves</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">so they can figure out where we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not ours to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">and this shows the continuity of mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">and life</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">in time it&#39;s very transpersonal</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">okay so here we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">we are in a time zone that has the</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">this is trans deregmatic thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">okay so this is an art installation that</p>

<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">um inspired by timothy morton&#39;s notion</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.640" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">this dispatch is that the metaphysics</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.279" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">i would argue someone said the other day</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:11.600" style="s2">on cap that capitalism you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">underlies just about everything and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.600" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">agree with that but underneath</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.120" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:20.159" style="s2">is the metaphysics of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">time change and causality how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.159" end="00:29:24.840" style="s2">construe them</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">made the design of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">possible this is why indigenous people</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">create capitalism because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:32.559" style="s2">understand time change and causality</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.559" end="00:29:38.399" style="s2">so i&#39;m saying that not only have they</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">primed the current medical crisis</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.399" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">but they create this reaction in us</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">that in which we continue to exert</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">upward pressure</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">towards civilization collapse so as long</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">as we</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:53.919" style="s2">address the metacrisis from within</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">the metaphysics of modernity and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">post-modernity we will continue</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">to exert upward pressure towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">civilization collapse</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:08.080" style="s2">now the the good news is that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.480" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">pressure towards civilization</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.080" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">collapse is making our heads wobble like</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">mine</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">these half-born ideas that we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">because our minds</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of things that upward</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">pressure is also exerting an</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">evolutionary pressure</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">to think outside these categories</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.720" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">so this happened for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">axial age</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">and plato was very cognizant that he was</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">using his mind in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">he had a word for it called diuresis</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">which is the word we get dialectical out</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">of this is how</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:50.320" style="s2">has happened before these transmutations</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.320" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">metamorphic changes in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">the architecture of mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.000" style="s2">so for me this upward pressure is also a</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">sign</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.000" end="00:31:12.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re using the uh metaphysics of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">modernity and and as i keep saying it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.080" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">modernity means both modernity in its</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">critique which we call post-modernity</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.799" end="00:31:25.039" style="s2">so here&#39;s something that i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.039" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">looks like not upward pressure and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:34.240" style="s2">a quote from david chandler</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">are coming into this right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.320" style="s2">the fact that there&#39;s so much conceptual</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.200" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">like what would it be to does this slide</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.000" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">no but it&#39;s sense full and can we do</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:40.720" style="s2">in a playful and compositional way i</p>

<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">are at the center of the universe and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">the human thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">um so what he&#39;s saying is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">to challenge these systemic</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">what it&#39;s like an arms race of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">complexification around</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:30.000" style="s2">progress civilization and development</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">and challenge</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.000" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">our fixed and empty framework of time in</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">space with ourselves at the center</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:42.400" style="s2">this is part of this metamorphosis</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">and so when you&#39;re doing sense making at</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.400" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">this scale</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">this is what you&#39;re trying to this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:50.320" style="s2">like part of your detector</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:52.720" style="s2">like is that there&#39;s always progress</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.320" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">in development and civilization must go</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.720" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">on and get better</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:57.280" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a techno fix and this</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:00.880" style="s2">and that this is all</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.280" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">part of modernity&#39;s impulse in</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.880" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">compulsion</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">as we face environmental destruction at</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">a planetary scale an</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">existential risk at a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:15.760" style="s2">we must examine our stories that stick</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">firmly to the modern imaginaries</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.760" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">since they emphasize our separation of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:22.079" style="s2">nature and destroy our shared</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">genealogy with the life force of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.079" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">so a lot of people talk about in these</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">in some of these conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">a new shared imaginary but</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">when they say that they&#39;re still inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">notions of progress civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">developmental bias and the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">people at the center of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not radical enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not a new imaginary it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">stuck in the old story as charles</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">eisenstein would say</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">and i would say that the news story as</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.119" style="s2">chandler says</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">has to be based on a different</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.119" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">metaphysics of time change and causality</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.560" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to look at those three</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">in the next sessions</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">very very closely so they&#39;re coming the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:12.880" style="s2">the details coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">so for me i do not intend to drive</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">up toward increasing complexification</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.320" style="s2">i intend to drive thinking down to its</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.359" style="s2">metaphysical roots</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.320" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make it easy to do it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.359" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">complex but it requires a metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:40.880" style="s2">insight down to the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">formative metaphysics that constrain our</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:43.200" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">now there is this concept</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">of theory constitutive</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">metaphor which means all our theories</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:38:02.839" style="s2">are based upon a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">mental model or a metaphor of how it</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.839" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">so for example we our conception of time</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">always spatial like a timeline</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">and everything that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">in the going forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">is progress and everything that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">past is primitive</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">this is a fundamental metaphor that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:32.480" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:36.280" style="s2">when we talk about civilization</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.480" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">and then we equate progress with</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.280" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">complexification so if it doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">more complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">we don&#39;t think it&#39;s progressive and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">don&#39;t aim that for that in the future so</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">these these metaphors get us all tangled</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">up into</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">trivial tautologies really</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:39:00.240" style="s2">right so the same way that we think</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">modernity you hear this over and over</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.240" end="00:39:03.119" style="s2">again and</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">i say too and i&#39;m not going to say it</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">anymore we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">modernity has benefited</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">many people and then here are the</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:14.400" style="s2">problems yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s because we equate modernity with</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.400" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">more complex with it must be better</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">despite a lot of evidence that modernity</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:24.240" style="s2">not really been very good for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.240" end="00:39:28.160" style="s2">and a lot of living creatures we have no</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.280" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.160" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">to say that because all our evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.280" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">based upon the assumption that more</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">complex and a certain type of progress</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">is better we&#39;re in this closed</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">metaphysical loop</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">and this is what we have to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">this is what</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">we need to come to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.320" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">that maybe modernity is not better</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">than pre-modernity or maybe there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.920" style="s2">way to judge</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:04.560" style="s2">all you can do is live in the time that</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">you live in</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.560" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">for many people modernity has not</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">been better and maybe for the majority</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not better</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">it&#39;s more complex more technologically</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">but you but you you can&#39;t equate that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">with better</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">and then say well then i just prove</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">maternity is better and that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">we live longer but we have mental health</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:42.400" style="s2">oh but that&#39;s better because we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:46.400" style="s2">quantify that we live longer</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.400" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">you can&#39;t hold core on what better means</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.400" end="00:40:50.839" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t mean and then prove with</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.800" style="s2">that definition that things have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.839" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.800" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">but you&#39;re stuck in a metaphysical loop</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:59.839" style="s2">because modernity</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">only counts some things as better and</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.839" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">those things are modern</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">can you see what i&#39;m saying here this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">really important for us to understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">the limitations of a closed metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.720" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">loop in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.359" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">yes changes has happened it is what it</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to prove it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.160" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">after a bifurcation event</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">when we&#39;re no longer modern what</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:38.960" style="s2">is better will be redefined</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">in its own terms and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.960" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">argue it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">so we really have to be careful we</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">really have to have a lot of epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">humility</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">when we&#39;re taking on these projects of</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:42:01.119" style="s2">from modernity for modernity</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">we have to look at modernity from</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.119" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">another place</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s a hard move it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">that theory gets more complicated but</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">metacognitive move is not simple</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a level of clarity and awareness</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">that is required</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">and i think this yeah so these stories</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">this is the last slide for today</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">these stories of separation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">alienation</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">are consequences of reasoning from a</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">particular set of metaphysical primes</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">associated with the mental structure of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:48.800" style="s2">from which the modern world in its</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">sequel the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.800" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">are scripted perhaps the term</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">modern in metamodern reflects the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">continuance of the same old metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:02.000" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">in new conceptual bottles but for me it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">signals a response</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.480" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">that we must look at modernity from</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">and this somewhere else is our period of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">latency</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">of a time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s the framing uh when we come</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going to look at time in the next</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:25.680" style="s2">session we&#39;ll look at change</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:26.960" style="s2">and then we look at causality in</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.680" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.960" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">as they live in the modern</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">mind and we&#39;ll look at alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">that are in the contemporary imagination</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.400" end="00:43:57.359" style="s2">thank you bonita</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">are you interested in opening up for</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.920" style="s2">questions at this point</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">or yeah let&#39;s see if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.920" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">and i think we have um</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">an hour and 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">so if we spend 15 minutes on questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:23.599" style="s2">we can preview time because i think i am</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">going to run</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.599" end="00:44:28.800" style="s2">out of time in four sessions so we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">maybe have 15 minutes of questions and</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.800" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">then we&#39;ll run the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">series on the slides on time and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">that can stew</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">in between the sessions if we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">enough questions and answers</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.480" end="00:44:48.160" style="s2">sounds good so</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">peter sforza has a question would you</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.160" end="00:44:51.680" style="s2">like to unmute and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:53.680" style="s2">peter</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.680" end="00:44:56.240" style="s2">yeah thanks benita that was great thanks</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.680" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">rayne i had two questions one was</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.240" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">thinking about the anthropocene but i</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">think the more relevant one is coming up</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">now about</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">uh the anecdote or stories of the tower</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:06.960" style="s2">of babel</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.440" end="00:45:09.520" style="s2">and this sort of uh how</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.960" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">how presumptuous of us to continue this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">upward</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.800" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">um idea that we can create this</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.800" style="s2">um unification how do how do you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">you thought about the tower of apple</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.800" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">anecdotes</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">with regards to complexity and some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">this framing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">giving yeah you&#39;re right you&#39;re right in</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">my heart space here</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:32.160" style="s2">um from a very early age i never</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:35.200" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.160" end="00:45:37.520" style="s2">that that story like</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.200" end="00:45:38.400" style="s2">like why do you want everyone talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.400" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">thing and i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s before or</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">after i understood evolution</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">but i remember very early on</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:49.599" style="s2">i shuddered um and we know from</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">evolution you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.599" end="00:45:53.359" style="s2">lots of different ways of making a</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">living well look at this when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.359" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">we get to one of the slides on donna</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">haraway and how</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:06.880" style="s2">what we want is more ways of making a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:12.400" style="s2">living more languages</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.880" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">more small commons more hybridization</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.400" end="00:46:17.599" style="s2">when we look at um civilization collapse</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:20.560" style="s2">if we have ecological collapse the</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.599" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">reindeer people will probably live</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">so then we have to rethink what</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">resilience is and resilience</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">is um not to have one language and one</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">and one hyper system um so</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">um but of course the um</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">yeah so so that&#39;s a that&#39;s i call it</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">also symbolic magnification</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.359" style="s2">we used to every little clan used to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">have all their</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.359" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">their totems and all their kings and</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:51.440" style="s2">queens</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:53.839" style="s2">mythology now we have like you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.440" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">uh symbolic magnification there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.839" end="00:46:56.960" style="s2">so many archetypes they apply to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.960" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">this is a reduction of the human</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:07.680" style="s2">this is a reduction of psychic</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:11.040" style="s2">imaginary it&#39;s a all these things are</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.680" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">highly reductive and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.040" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">because they&#39;ve capitalized under a few</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">winners</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a three or four big</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">archetypes uh they&#39;re very fragile</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not resilient and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">you can see in a lot of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:29.680" style="s2">in civilization collapse</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">even if they&#39;re talking about resilience</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.680" end="00:47:34.240" style="s2">they&#39;re still looking for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">like we need a shared common imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.240" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">we need a cl</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s still in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.440" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s the developmental bias of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">progress is an accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">of a unification kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">um for me you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">you can&#39;t it&#39;s like you can&#39;t have your</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:48:00.720" style="s2">cake and eat it too</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">and um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.720" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">that that i get that hit right there</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:09.839" style="s2">with the tower of babel story</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">um yeah thanks that was great</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.839" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">i like the resilience comment too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:17.280" style="s2">my saying for the summer has been that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">consilience ate resilience for breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.280" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">and meaning that we still need to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">resilient but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:25.440" style="s2">there&#39;s more to it than that yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:28.079" style="s2">and when we look at um</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.440" end="00:48:30.160" style="s2">uh change we&#39;re gonna look closely at</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.079" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">the panarchy cycle and how people have</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.160" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">co-opted the notion of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:36.480" style="s2">and turned it into the same logics that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.480" end="00:48:39.920" style="s2">brought us to fragility like we just</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.920" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">out of that mindset</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">okay a question from kim</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.359" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">go ahead yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">hi bonnie thanks for this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">this is just um you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">it feels like you&#39;re really pulling</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">together a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">felt senses that um and tangiblizing the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">beautiful pictures by the way um and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">uh the the question i mean this is just</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">you you answered a little bit of it just</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">now with</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">multiple languages but my question is</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:30.400" style="s2">okay we are in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">you know in between worlds things and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.400" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">the ability for us to go forward as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">uh as i get</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.079" end="00:49:39.040" style="s2">and with what you&#39;re saying is for us to</p>

<p begin="00:49:39.040" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:48.319" style="s2">and how do we know i hate how questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">but what is the language that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.319" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">use as we uh interplay with others and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">perhaps those who are really based in</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">the modern post-modern world</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">to engage at this</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">or begin to engage at this level i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">this is the always the question well how</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">do we do this how do we do this so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">gonna throw it back at you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">but kind of with that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">languages um and being</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">senseful within this context that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:20.480" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:22.960" style="s2">this in this olympic space between</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.480" end="00:50:26.319" style="s2">worlds if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.960" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">yeah so i don&#39;t know how we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.319" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:30.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how we language that i</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">think we</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.319" end="00:50:37.839" style="s2">experiment which we all are doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:41.599" style="s2">um hopefully one of the skills this</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">session will build is try not to do that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.599" end="00:50:45.520" style="s2">and then if you try not to do that then</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.520" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">nothing to put in its place and then you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:52.839" style="s2">just have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">be there like if i don&#39;t think of if</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.839" end="00:50:58.720" style="s2">then how do i think of change</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">and then and then this is a great</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.720" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">meditation this is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">you know i shared this story in one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">my store sessions when i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">doing this dialogue this workshop in san</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">francisco</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">and then sorry for all said what if</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no if and no then</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">ah now something cracks in my head that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">whole way of trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.400" style="s2">causality without if then</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">he made it me aware that the if then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:28.480" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">is a certain assumption can we examine</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.480" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">why the brain does that why does your</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">mind do that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">what if i don&#39;t let my mind do that uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:40.079" style="s2">well you know maybe then i go and drink</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">a beer or if i&#39;m peter lindbergh i smoke</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.079" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">a cigar</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know but you start to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">really understand the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">now i&#39;m with them because</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">you guys can ask questions that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">are previewing what we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">doing but then this will give us</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:03.760" style="s2">capacity when it comes on</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">and so like like um</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">another another reason why i call this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">the hollow</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">is because your mind is like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">is like the hollow of a tree be careful</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">what you put in there</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">right and now i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">go to the buddhist thing and say</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:23.920" style="s2">your mind should be empty</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">i think your mind should be creative and</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.920" end="00:52:29.200" style="s2">you should be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:31.599" style="s2">constructs the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.200" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">metaphors that you use to examine</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:38.720" style="s2">and how do we change those how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">change those now here&#39;s where your mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.720" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">goes okay here&#39;s with them</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">how do i change those so the world gets</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">you see that&#39;s what comes in it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:49.119" style="s2">come in</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:49.920" style="s2">how do i examine that so it gets better</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.119" end="00:52:52.400" style="s2">and then you say</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">no i have to i have to let that</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.400" end="00:52:58.160" style="s2">orientation go too</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:52:59.920" style="s2">we know change happens uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.160" end="00:53:02.720" style="s2">why am i preoccupied with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.920" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">qualitative measurement of better when i</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.720" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">said there&#39;s no way to know what better</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">because when catastrophic change happens</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:14.319" style="s2">what we say is better also changes</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:17.760" style="s2">because our mindset will change</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.319" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">so um um</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.760" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">if you&#39;re lucky these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:24.720" style="s2">that you do when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">meditating on these things uh create fun</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.720" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">enjoyment and you laugh because because</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.319" end="00:53:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like like kids when they can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">out of a maze and they laugh</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.559" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re really trying and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">not lucky it drives you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">and you you commit suicide or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:42.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s something of the process that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.559" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.520" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">goes into here and you know i&#39;m sharing</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.160" style="s2">quotes from people who&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:51.599" style="s2">cool books that i call them post</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.160" end="00:53:53.760" style="s2">anthropic</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.599" end="00:53:55.599" style="s2">and we like to get them on the store</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:57.359" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that but</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.599" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">these things are happening in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.359" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">minds to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:04.079" style="s2">you know to think in this way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:07.359" style="s2">experiment in this way</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.079" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">uh and we&#39;ll meet some of them as we go</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.359" end="00:54:11.440" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">and so uh one of the reasons why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.440" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">doing all this framework framing is</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:17.200" style="s2">because you can read them</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:18.240" style="s2">and you can capitalize it with a modern</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.200" end="00:54:19.680" style="s2">mindset and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.240" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">if you read these people carefully</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.680" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">they&#39;re saying something else i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">they&#39;re saying something more like</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">we&#39;re saying here</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">one of the biggest breakthroughs that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">had when i was running a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">collective insight</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">processes here is there was a group that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">was meeting quite often</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">and we were examining the contraction</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.799" style="s2">when you&#39;re not understood by other</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:53.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">but it got</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.839" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">it got foregrounded once we realized</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">that something</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.079" style="s2">some of the tension that seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:05.520" style="s2">going on was really</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.079" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">that there was a fear someone said oh no</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.520" end="00:55:08.799" style="s2">it&#39;s a fear and at first it was like i</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t feel like i belong but</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.799" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">that was like stupid</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">and what we did was this thought of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:15.520" style="s2">experiment we said</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">how much of my experience like if two</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">people see</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">an accident and the cop</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">asks each one of them what happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll get two different stories</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">sometimes very competing stories</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">even when we look at the freaking</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">cameras on the cops</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:36.319" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t adjudicate the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">perspectival nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.319" end="00:55:43.280" style="s2">of the experience so then we said</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">here sitting here in this collective</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.280" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">how much experience you think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">actually sharing</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">like we realized that we had this</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">assumption that we were sharing the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">experience but that our language</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">was different right so we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:02.160" style="s2">semantically map</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">and make sure that we&#39;re all on the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.160" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">page and we got</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">so we realized that maybe we didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">weren&#39;t having the same experience</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">then we did this thought experiment what</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">if we actually share</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:21.119" style="s2">no experience zero no meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.839" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2">no sense making everything we say</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.119" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">has we live in our own little bubble</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:28.839" style="s2">and we all got like you know when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">in these sense-making spaces it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.839" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">and then we realized that the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">would still hang together</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">so then we realized that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.839" style="s2">construction of that question</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">is just based upon some kind of faulty</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.839" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:48.079" style="s2">of do things connect or they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">connect and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.079" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">like the whole the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">based upon assumptions that things</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">connect in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">that things are shared in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">that things make sense in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">and we realize yeah actually they do</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">connect</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">they do make sense and there is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:08.720" style="s2">but we have no freaking idea how</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">and there&#39;s no sense to try to make that</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.720" end="00:57:11.599" style="s2">happen because it either doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">or doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.599" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">which case we it&#39;s not a question at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:18.160" style="s2">because we&#39;ve got something like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">and this is kind of a little bit of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.160" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">attitude</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.119" end="00:57:22.720" style="s2">a little bit of the attitude about</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">evolutionary change it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.720" end="00:57:29.119" style="s2">something we can work on it works on</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">us so</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.119" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">you know it looks like i&#39;m working on it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">because i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:39.359" style="s2">in it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">you have to you have to there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.359" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not a naive realist but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:50.240" style="s2">naively take reality</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">to be real and that it works</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.240" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">and that you can trust it and it does</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:57.119" style="s2">what it does and you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:58:00.319" style="s2">any better there&#39;s a there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">smell in these sense making spheres</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.319" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">i call it the god problem you probably</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">heard me talk about it before because</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:12.480" style="s2">i this liberated me i worked so hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.960" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">to help people make humanity healthy</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.480" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">and then i realized that it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">have a god problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">that you think you could do better than</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:22.480" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">or cosmogenesis or god like you really</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.480" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">think you can figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">right and this it&#39;s not possible it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:31.359" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">possible to operate on the world from</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.359" end="00:58:34.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:35.119" style="s2">from that leverage point that vantage</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.400" end="00:58:37.440" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.119" end="00:58:39.200" style="s2">so then the question is how can you</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.440" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">operate in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.200" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">ah you have a vantage point to operate</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:46.000" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:48.000" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.000" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">yeah but what you can do is operate on</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.000" end="00:58:52.640" style="s2">your mind from that vantage point</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just really really hard to do to</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.640" end="00:58:55.359" style="s2">understand that these are the traps that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.359" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">these loops that you&#39;re stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:07.760" style="s2">thank you i i just want to also say</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m discovering is operating with</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.760" end="00:59:11.440" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s that creativity</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">that what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.440" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">is you&#39;re watching your mind you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">growing you&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">you&#39;re watching and it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:26.079" style="s2">this fun but</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:32.799" style="s2">kind of wild ride almost yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.079" end="00:59:37.440" style="s2">it&#39;s wow yeah thanks</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.799" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">so benito we&#39;re at the 15 minutes of q a</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.440" end="00:59:42.079" style="s2">um so you said you wanted to move on to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.640" end="00:59:43.760" style="s2">some slides on time</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.079" end="00:59:45.920" style="s2">i just want there&#39;s some great questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">in the chat and i just want to highlight</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.920" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">a couple</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:50.400" style="s2">and let you decide benito whether you</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">want to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.400" end="00:59:53.520" style="s2">now or later because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:55.280" style="s2">definitional questions and</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.520" end="00:59:57.040" style="s2">as this is the first session that might</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.280" end="00:59:59.520" style="s2">be valuable so</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">there were there was one question on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.520" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">definition of better</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">yeah and then there&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">on your definition of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:09.520" style="s2">okay yeah no i said if we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">enough questions we could do that but</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.520" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">this is i think we should spend time on</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">the questions</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">okay so the question of better</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">um a lot of these questions i have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">pivot to stories because it gets way too</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">complicated to</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:30.319" style="s2">metatheorize around it but what one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:33.280" style="s2">the things we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.319" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">look at uh well we&#39;ll look at this</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.280" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">notion of better</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:42.160" style="s2">progress um</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">later but i use the term</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.160" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">i borrowed it from yonkaporta and he</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:48.240" style="s2">talked about he said my people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">have this notion of progress we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.240" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">this notion of increase</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">and i wrote that in a paper and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">editor said</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">i i can&#39;t see any difference like</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s very tricky because we can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:06.960" style="s2">eventually we see it as better</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:09.640" style="s2">or progress right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.960" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">we can see increase it seems</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.640" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">quantitative</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">how can i understand that qualitative so</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard it took me a while to</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">how to relate to this term increase</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">without subtly</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">having this notion of better or progress</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">so this this is very very hard to do the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:33.599" style="s2">fact that it&#39;s hard to do makes me very</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:34.559" style="s2">stubborn because like i don&#39;t want my</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.599" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">brain to like</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.559" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">clamp down like that right um</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:43.839" style="s2">so in the paper we&#39;re working on a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">paper i wrote this part of this is this</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.839" end="01:01:48.640" style="s2">research i did</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">i was trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.640" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">explain to this editor that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:57.680" style="s2">increase doesn&#39;t mean progress and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">the metaphor i used is</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.680" end="01:02:00.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">and let me see and tell me if this works</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.839" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">decouple the notion of increase</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">with progress and so i wrote</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:24.720" style="s2">the way increase the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.760" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">frost concentrates sugar in the fruit</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.720" end="01:02:28.000" style="s2">or the way trouble</p>

<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">increases this notion of concentration</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">not accumulation</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:44.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s one way of relating</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:50.319" style="s2">that i relate to this notion</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.720" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">of increase but i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.319" end="01:02:57.280" style="s2">how young caporto&#39;s native</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">or natural way of relating to that that</p>

<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:04.480" style="s2">is so</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.359" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not increasing complexification</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.480" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">the way trouble concentrates</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">conversation you wouldn&#39;t say that was</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s necessarily complex</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.480" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to complexify you might</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:22.319" style="s2">not be able to talk but it increases</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like becomes more senseful</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.319" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">senseful and if you know about</p>

<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">because the fruit gets concentrated</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:38.640" style="s2">so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the metaphor that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">thought of</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.640" end="01:03:45.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s not easy to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">come into relationship with the term</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.039" end="01:03:50.079" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">uh without conflating it with better or</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.079" end="01:03:53.280" style="s2">progress is it better to have trouble</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.280" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">trying to talk to someone</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.280" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">no i wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">was that helpful for that question i</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.039" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like a handicap and working at this</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.760" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:17.200" style="s2">uh insight that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">did you want to say anything about your</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.200" end="01:04:21.680" style="s2">definition of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">oh yes so um i should have said that at</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.680" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">first so</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:27.520" style="s2">i have um uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">i use charles hart shorn&#39;s definition of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.520" end="01:04:32.079" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:36.000" style="s2">and metaphysics is uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.079" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">like the deepest categories</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:42.400" style="s2">or metaphors or mental models</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">that underline and construct make make</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.400" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">thought possible but also constrain</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:53.119" style="s2">to those metaphors that architecture</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:56.160" style="s2">those movements those categories okay so</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.119" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">i call them metaphysical primes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.160" end="01:05:01.839" style="s2">very very very</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:05.599" style="s2">deep in structuration of thought</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.839" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">um and not even conceptual thought um</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.599" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">even reaction like you see something and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">you move this way</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">or that way or right</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">in left brain uh schemas is really a</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.119" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">very very deep metaphysics right because</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:25.839" style="s2">we&#39;re constrained</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:29.280" style="s2">to that bicamerality</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.839" end="01:05:31.839" style="s2">uh yeah so are they accessible yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.280" end="01:05:33.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.839" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">and i suppose the ones that are not</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.440" end="01:05:38.559" style="s2">accessible</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:42.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna be working with them</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.559" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">um um but a lot of um</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.240" end="01:05:45.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s what insight practice is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.440" end="01:05:49.920" style="s2">i think collective insight practice the</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">way i teach is trying to get it</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.920" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">at these these really deep habits</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">of or architecture or schemas of thought</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:06.000" style="s2">so we can disembed from the constraints</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">and when whitehead for example wrote</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.000" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">process in reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:12.640" style="s2">he was doing speculative metaphysics he</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:16.839" style="s2">knew he was he thought that there was</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:19.760" style="s2">a usefulness for it to come up with</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.839" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">reasonable theories of the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.760" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">the world might work based on different</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:27.839" style="s2">for him change and relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:30.400" style="s2">we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.839" end="01:06:32.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at some of whitehead&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.400" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">metaphysics as alternatives</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.720" end="01:06:36.880" style="s2">to the metaphysics of modernity</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">thank you are you good for more</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:48.240" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">yeah yeah we&#39;ll just just uh they go</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.240" end="01:06:52.799" style="s2">they&#39;re great questions and i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">uh you know the more understanding we</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">can get now once we get into</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">the conceptual territory the more um</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:07.599" style="s2">the better it&#39;ll be great</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">better um lots of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.599" end="01:07:15.599" style="s2">it&#39;ll increase our experience very good</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">hugely bigly</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.599" end="01:07:23.440" style="s2">concentrate that that wisdom um</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:25.200" style="s2">peter lindbergh lots of plus ones</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.440" end="01:07:27.280" style="s2">all right uh so there&#39;s a question here</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.200" end="01:07:27.680" style="s2">bonita but if anything is salient for</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.280" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.680" end="01:07:31.200" style="s2">feel free to respond to it so i&#39;ll read</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:33.119" style="s2">it out</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.200" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">recently in stewarding the stoa others</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.119" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">have been encouraging me to scale this</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.640" end="01:07:37.520" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:39.200" style="s2">have collective goals for it etc this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.520" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">somewhat scrambling the way i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.200" end="01:07:41.200" style="s2">operating here since the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:43.039" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.200" end="01:07:44.480" style="s2">what i&#39;ve referred to as listening to</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">the daemon</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.480" end="01:07:48.559" style="s2">feeling into this pressure on a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:50.720" style="s2">sensefulness level i sense like urgency</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.559" end="01:07:52.480" style="s2">and behind that i sense fear on a</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.720" end="01:07:55.760" style="s2">propositional level i hear</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.480" end="01:07:57.280" style="s2">see modernist frameworks goals scaling</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.760" end="01:07:58.880" style="s2">truth etc</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.280" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">what is the interplay if any between</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.880" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">having a bad relationship with fear and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">modernity&#39;s proclivity for control</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.280" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">yeah so um</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.280" end="01:08:18.640" style="s2">i think what i&#39;m just going to tell you</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:21.759" style="s2">how i teach fear</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.640" end="01:08:24.000" style="s2">in my my course because we just we do a</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.759" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">module on the affects</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.000" end="01:08:28.719" style="s2">so fear is the contracted form of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:32.000" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.719" end="01:08:35.920" style="s2">their neuro anatomically neurochemically</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.000" end="01:08:38.960" style="s2">and neurodynamically in the same path</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.920" end="01:08:42.319" style="s2">so if you have fear you ask your ques</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.960" end="01:08:44.560" style="s2">so you can feel the toggle right so when</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.319" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">you&#39;re in the woods and you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.560" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">for something then there&#39;s fear right</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:50.839" style="s2">there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">so fear is the energy of seeking</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.839" end="01:08:54.480" style="s2">contracted</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">so what you want to do is use its energy</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.480" end="01:08:59.440" style="s2">for free</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:09:00.480" style="s2">and you want to try to orient it toward</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.440" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">to the seeking</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.480" end="01:09:04.719" style="s2">what are you seeking well you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:06.880" style="s2">really know because the damon is seeking</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.719" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2">so you can orient toward the seeking</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.880" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:11.839" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to toggle between high</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:15.480" style="s2">times and fear</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.839" end="01:09:16.799" style="s2">because it&#39;s the same neural anatomical</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.480" end="01:09:21.120" style="s2">neurodynamical</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.799" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">path this is true for animals also</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.120" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">now the expanded form of fear and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:28.239" style="s2">seeking is awe</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">that&#39;s the highest expanded form and</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.239" end="01:09:32.839" style="s2">that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:37.040" style="s2">in the same path so the vajrayana awe</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.839" end="01:09:39.679" style="s2">is the baby sister of awe is fear</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.040" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">in the middle in the middle son is</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.679" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">seeking</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:46.080" style="s2">and the grand old damn at the end is</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">just standing in awe</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.080" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">and this woman diane uh</p>

<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">she noticed she&#39;s the one that put this</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:59.679" style="s2">together this framework together</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">and she called them the tremulous energy</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.679" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">because when you&#39;re fearful</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:04.800" style="s2">you&#39;re trembling and when you&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:06.320" style="s2">and you&#39;re really you&#39;re trembling and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.800" end="01:10:08.560" style="s2">when you&#39;re standing in awe</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.320" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">you&#39;re trembling and she started to see</p>

<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:14.800" style="s2">uh vagal patterns and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.640" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">so when you&#39;re working with fear you</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.800" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">just know it&#39;s energy for free</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">it&#39;s seeking energy it still has energy</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just a little contracted</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:25.199" style="s2">because you can&#39;t like boom you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.320" end="01:10:27.199" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.199" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">be in expanded form all the time there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.199" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">always breathing in and breathing out</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">so so uh that can be your friend</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">that can be your friend</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.520" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">is that helpful or do you want a</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">clarifying question</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">uh that&#39;s very helpful and something i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">noodle on i also wonder if you had</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">anything about the other part of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">question how it relates to modernity</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">is there something like inherently</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">pathologically embedded in modernity</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a good relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.920" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">fear</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">i would say that the beginning of your</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">question was right you&#39;re detecting</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">some kind of pathology of modernity to</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">make more sense of what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:18.320" style="s2">to wrap it up to to</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">i mean i feel that too i mean okay i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.320" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">not very proud of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">but like sometimes i want to be more</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">like them because i get bigger likes on</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">your store channel i</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:28.080" style="s2">get more watching you know i mean this</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">happens in our mind it&#39;s like bonnie if</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.080" end="01:11:32.239" style="s2">you just got like real</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">then maybe you know if you just</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.239" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">downloaded your conceptual territory</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">uh but that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeking you</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:41.600" style="s2">see that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not what&#39;s operating in us so i</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.600" end="01:11:46.000" style="s2">get it</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:46.960" style="s2">and um and there&#39;s no right or wrong in</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.000" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">this it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.960" end="01:11:50.719" style="s2">it&#39;s just where&#39;s the energy moving and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:54.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.719" end="01:11:55.280" style="s2">um when i you know there&#39;s lots and lots</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.640" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.280" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">good video channels and i think that</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:04.239" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t think they have a very long</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:07.440" style="s2">shelf life except maybe joe rogan</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.239" end="01:12:10.560" style="s2">and you know um</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.440" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">i think what what what the trade-offs</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.560" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">are making i think they&#39;re really as</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:18.239" style="s2">long as they keep</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:20.800" style="s2">keep increasing like you know then uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.239" end="01:12:22.719" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good formula you</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.800" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">know um but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.719" end="01:12:27.360" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:29.440" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get like</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.360" end="01:12:31.280" style="s2">the ratings or the spoils of modernity</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.440" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re not playing that game</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.280" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">um yeah</p>

<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:12.000" style="s2">if we look at it metacognitively how do</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.840" end="01:13:14.480" style="s2">we incorporate play</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.000" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">rather than using a modernist framework</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.480" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">of a lecture based format</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:20.719" style="s2">because what we&#39;re doing here is no</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:24.159" style="s2">different than</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.719" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">you know a platonic uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.159" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">framework of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">dialogue or talking at and</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:39.520" style="s2">um i&#39;m trying to cohere that with</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">uh the content of what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.520" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.760" end="01:13:48.159" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a good question um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.960" end="01:13:49.840" style="s2">funny because i heard</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.159" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">you say play and then when you say play</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.840" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">playtonic i</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:14:00.560" style="s2">heard p-l-a-y tonic</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:14:02.880" style="s2">tonic um okay so</p>

<p begin="01:14:13.040" end="01:14:19.760" style="s2">uh so i always i i quite often</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.960" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">seem illogical or have performed a</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.760" end="01:14:24.320" style="s2">contradiction i happen to think</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:24.880" style="s2">this is a form of high play like for me</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.320" end="01:14:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.880" end="01:14:30.719" style="s2">it it&#39;s quite playful um</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.560" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">i understand the cognitive load and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.719" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">conceptual burden</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">and for some people this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:38.719" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem playful i spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.719" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">um choosing the the music at the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">um because i think it&#39;s it&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:50.880" style="s2">face and it&#39;s playful</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:53.440" style="s2">um so so</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.880" end="01:14:54.080" style="s2">um and then i think energetically i try</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.440" end="01:14:57.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.080" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">be have playful energy um</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.360" end="01:15:00.560" style="s2">but is it as good as like rolling in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:02.880" style="s2">hay</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.560" end="01:15:03.840" style="s2">and then sitting back and talking about</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.880" end="01:15:10.719" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.840" end="01:15:14.880" style="s2">modernity no i mean um now</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.719" end="01:15:14.880" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna say this that um</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.840" end="01:15:23.040" style="s2">yeah so i would say this is playtonic</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">hopefully um and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.040" end="01:15:31.440" style="s2">um maybe i&#39;ll i&#39;ll look over my slides</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.440" end="01:15:36.480" style="s2">and see if i can&#39;t put in some that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.440" end="01:15:36.480" style="s2">more play-like because of that comment</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.840" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">um i don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.239" end="01:15:46.000" style="s2">um how would you make it more playful</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">i i think the technology itself is not</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.000" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">very fun</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.840" end="01:15:54.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:55.760" style="s2">well you know it&#39;s something for all of</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.080" end="01:15:58.960" style="s2">us always to think about</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.760" end="01:16:02.000" style="s2">um but i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering if just</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.960" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">thinking about the um structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.000" end="01:16:07.040" style="s2">hollow or the stoa</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.000" end="01:16:09.679" style="s2">or peter&#39;s concerns in a</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.040" end="01:16:11.040" style="s2">uh modernistic framework of fear and</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.679" end="01:16:15.840" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.040" end="01:16:18.719" style="s2">um if we throw all those out and go back</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.840" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">uh to primitive how would that look how</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.719" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">would our</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">interactivity be though limited by zoom</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.719" end="01:16:31.440" style="s2">be playful because we we uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.480" end="01:16:36.480" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of operating on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:39.440" style="s2">perception that</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.480" end="01:16:40.560" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a a goal to be had by doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.440" end="01:16:43.199" style="s2">the hollow</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.560" end="01:16:45.840" style="s2">there&#39;s an end point of skill sets or</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.199" end="01:16:49.600" style="s2">thought processes we want to</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.840" end="01:16:52.560" style="s2">evolve to after four sessions</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.600" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">as i and i guess what i&#39;m confused about</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.560" end="01:16:56.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:59.360" style="s2">um do i or the stoa</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.080" end="01:17:00.880" style="s2">and this is to peter&#39;s journal from two</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.360" end="01:17:05.679" style="s2">or three nights ago</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.880" end="01:17:09.600" style="s2">um should there be a goal orientation</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.679" end="01:17:12.800" style="s2">which is very modern post-modernistic</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.600" end="01:17:12.800" style="s2">to the stowe or not</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">okay that&#39;s a bit that&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:23.040" style="s2">great re reframe all right i think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.960" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">uh one of the goals of let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.040" end="01:17:27.440" style="s2">holo</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:30.239" style="s2">is to build a skill there are some skill</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.440" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">building things in here</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.239" end="01:17:36.480" style="s2">that i&#39;m trying to sneak in but one is</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:38.239" style="s2">to be able to be aware of your</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.480" end="01:17:41.440" style="s2">architecture of your mind</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.239" end="01:17:45.280" style="s2">now though just the way i i</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.440" end="01:17:47.679" style="s2">talked to peter about fear in seeking</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.280" end="01:17:49.199" style="s2">play is in the mastery stream so we</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.679" end="01:17:53.199" style="s2">think of play</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.199" end="01:17:55.760" style="s2">uh a play is not just light you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.199" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">sports and training and martial arts all</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.760" end="01:18:00.719" style="s2">that is play</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:01.040" style="s2">and play build skills and so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.719" end="01:18:04.080" style="s2">sk</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.040" end="01:18:06.960" style="s2">we could build skills here um</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.080" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">and um and primarily the one we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.960" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:12.480" style="s2">is metacognitive capacity and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">kind of play</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.480" end="01:18:18.000" style="s2">in the mastery sense um so</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:20.080" style="s2">peter and i have talked a lot about what</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.000" end="01:18:21.199" style="s2">if every conversation could build a</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.080" end="01:18:24.159" style="s2">skill</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.199" end="01:18:25.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean it has a goal right i</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.159" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">can teach you how to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.280" end="01:18:29.199" style="s2">shoot a gun and your goals could be</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:31.760" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.199" end="01:18:33.280" style="s2">and so we actually talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.760" end="01:18:35.040" style="s2">like that could be</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.280" end="01:18:37.440" style="s2">a guiding principle where every</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.040" end="01:18:40.159" style="s2">conversation builds a skill</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t download content doesn&#39;t aim for</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.159" end="01:18:44.560" style="s2">a goal</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">and so that&#39;s i think very close to what</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.560" end="01:18:48.880" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">asking and i would say that the skill</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.880" end="01:18:54.560" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">is um in the sense of mastery</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.560" end="01:19:01.679" style="s2">is um an uh metacognitive awareness</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:03.280" style="s2">being able to really get out and see</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.679" end="01:19:06.080" style="s2">modernity from a place</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.280" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">outside of the categories of modernity</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:09.679" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:11.040" style="s2">just a little bit um so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.679" end="01:19:13.360" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.040" end="01:19:16.320" style="s2">goal-oriented as some of these</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.360" end="01:19:16.719" style="s2">these other things the second thing that</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.320" end="01:19:18.320" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.719" end="01:19:20.560" style="s2">interested in and i had this</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.320" end="01:19:24.400" style="s2">conversation before</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.560" end="01:19:27.679" style="s2">with people that are also sense making</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.400" end="01:19:31.920" style="s2">um some of my friends and colleagues</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.679" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">because i was wondering like like</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.920" end="01:19:35.199" style="s2">that like what is the difference in my</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:37.840" style="s2">approach than other</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.199" end="01:19:39.440" style="s2">people&#39;s approaches and we i came in</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.840" end="01:19:41.120" style="s2">dialogue with someone i came to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.440" end="01:19:44.719" style="s2">conclusion that</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.120" end="01:19:48.719" style="s2">in many respects other people</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.719" end="01:19:51.199" style="s2">have an implicit goal they kind of know</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.719" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">what better is they kind of know that</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.199" end="01:19:56.239" style="s2">they want to tweak the system</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:58.400" style="s2">in this way and not others and what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.239" end="01:19:59.040" style="s2">all about is injecting novelty into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.400" end="01:20:01.199" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.040" end="01:20:02.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what way it wants to go but</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.199" end="01:20:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.199" end="01:20:07.040" style="s2">habituated that i just want to inject</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.960" end="01:20:10.320" style="s2">novelty into the system</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.040" end="01:20:10.800" style="s2">and then i trust that as it gets shaken</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.320" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.800" end="01:20:14.800" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go where it wants to go</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.040" end="01:20:16.960" style="s2">because that&#39;s the inevitable anyways</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.800" end="01:20:19.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be what it is so</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.960" end="01:20:21.600" style="s2">my orientation to my work is to inject</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.600" end="01:20:25.440" style="s2">novelty in the system</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.600" end="01:20:27.440" style="s2">and i and in many other cases and this</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.440" end="01:20:27.920" style="s2">might be the pressure that peter is well</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.440" end="01:20:31.360" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.920" end="01:20:34.000" style="s2">where are you going with this and</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.360" end="01:20:34.480" style="s2">um so that&#39;s another distinction that</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.000" end="01:20:37.280" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.480" end="01:20:37.280" style="s2">that i would make</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.520" end="01:20:44.840" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:47.840" style="s2">was that helpful close to the best i can</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.840" end="01:20:47.840" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.080" end="01:20:57.760" style="s2">okay question from</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.199" end="01:21:00.880" style="s2">tanya hewitt if you&#39;re here you can ask</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.760" end="01:21:03.440" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.880" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">so benita i just wanted to thank you so</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.440" end="01:21:08.400" style="s2">much for this</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">this is you know um when i was uh</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.400" end="01:21:15.040" style="s2">doing my uh doctorate that i had one</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:20.239" style="s2">single lecture on</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.040" end="01:21:22.239" style="s2">um indigenous understanding of reality</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.239" end="01:21:24.080" style="s2">and just as you were talking i was just</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:26.840" style="s2">wondering if you uh have</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.080" end="01:21:28.000" style="s2">if you believe that in dead indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.840" end="01:21:30.719" style="s2">peoples</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.000" end="01:21:33.199" style="s2">the ones who are kind of faithful to the</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.719" end="01:21:42.080" style="s2">way that they have traditionally lived</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.199" end="01:21:46.560" style="s2">are senseful in the way that they live</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">um okay so um this is an opinion</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.560" end="01:21:49.679" style="s2">and there&#39;s always like a certain kind</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:50.400" style="s2">of territory i enter in when it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.679" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">an opinion</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.400" end="01:21:56.960" style="s2">like i relate to it as an opinion um</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:59.760" style="s2">i think there&#39;s very very few indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.960" end="01:22:03.520" style="s2">people left in the planet</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.760" end="01:22:07.040" style="s2">most of them are modern people</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.520" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">from a certain culture okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.040" end="01:22:11.840" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.560" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">you see it&#39;s hard right were they more</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.800" end="01:22:23.120" style="s2">senseful</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.600" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">in the past um yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.120" end="01:22:26.960" style="s2">um i would say in my definition of</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.840" end="01:22:31.840" style="s2">senseful</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.960" end="01:22:35.199" style="s2">it&#39;s comes after going through modern</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.840" end="01:22:37.120" style="s2">modernity um</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.199" end="01:22:38.560" style="s2">so i would say indigenous people are</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.120" end="01:22:41.440" style="s2">more like sensing</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.560" end="01:22:42.560" style="s2">their their perceptual organs are in</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.440" end="01:22:45.600" style="s2">many cases</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.560" end="01:22:46.560" style="s2">if they&#39;re truly indigenous as that word</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.600" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.560" end="01:22:50.840" style="s2">are usually more alive you know they can</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:53.840" style="s2">smell things they can see</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.840" end="01:22:53.840" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.159" end="01:22:58.639" style="s2">they have more what we would call direct</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.760" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">perception sensory awareness</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.639" end="01:23:04.320" style="s2">but i think since fullness for me uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:05.360" style="s2">i would you i&#39;m using the term as if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.320" end="01:23:06.880" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.360" end="01:23:08.960" style="s2">you have to have gone through not</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.880" end="01:23:10.159" style="s2">individually but humans have to go</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.960" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.159" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">uh modernity</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:18.159" style="s2">even as an indigenous person you go</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.440" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">through modernity suffering it let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.159" end="01:23:21.679" style="s2">you didn&#39;t you didn&#39;t capitulate to it</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:24.159" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.679" end="01:23:25.679" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone through it suffering it does</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.159" end="01:23:27.280" style="s2">that help</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.679" end="01:23:30.159" style="s2">so the way i&#39;m using that word that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.280" end="01:23:30.159" style="s2">where i want it to</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.840" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.520" end="01:23:39.520" style="s2">indigenous people never suffered</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:40.560" style="s2">modernity are not the same as indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.520" end="01:23:43.199" style="s2">people who suffer</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.560" end="01:23:44.480" style="s2">modernity it&#39;s a it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.199" end="01:23:48.880" style="s2">different thing and i&#39;m not sure there</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.480" end="01:23:52.080" style="s2">are any</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.880" end="01:23:52.080" style="s2">of the other yet anymore</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.760" end="01:23:59.360" style="s2">okay that was a great uh question one</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.800" end="01:24:02.159" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.360" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">if it&#39;s highlighted uh but i don&#39;t want</p>

<p begin="01:29:12.080" end="01:29:16.159" style="s2">sharpen our thinking and to</p>
