<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:47.550" style="s2">think McDowell has population at 50</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:49.080" style="s2">something like that I&#39;m gonna say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.550" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">that&#39;s probably a good guess on a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.080" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">day yeah that&#39;s what we always guessed</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:54.270" style="s2">it&#39;s so small doesn&#39;t even appear in the</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.270" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">live a mile five miles down the river</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.099" end="00:02:01.349" style="s2">there maybe 20 houses between us and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">Beth so amazingly low the population</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.349" end="00:02:06.539" style="s2">density there is in the county so Beth</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">what&#39;s that amazingly low population</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.539" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">density mean to you and the work that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:14.599" style="s2">you do well that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:17.220" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s the blessing of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.599" end="00:02:19.590" style="s2">neighborliness because there are so few</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.220" end="00:02:21.670" style="s2">of us it&#39;s not just that we know all</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.590" end="00:02:23.709" style="s2">each other it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.670" end="00:02:25.989" style="s2">we have to count on each other because</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.709" end="00:02:27.400" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anybody else so I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.989" end="00:02:29.950" style="s2">chaplain for the fire department for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.400" end="00:02:32.170" style="s2">example and we often talk there about</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.950" end="00:02:34.300" style="s2">they respond to whatever call it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.170" end="00:02:36.190" style="s2">matter if your best friends are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.300" end="00:02:39.010" style="s2">because they go because you need them</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.190" end="00:02:41.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s really the the credo I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.010" end="00:02:43.690" style="s2">in a sparsely populated place it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.920" end="00:02:45.310" style="s2">matter what we think of each other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:46.870" style="s2">always there to help because we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.310" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">yeah we certainly don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.870" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">standoffish suburban thing right if</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.220" style="s2">someone needs help they&#39;ll come and ask</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.690" style="s2">you right and then the expectation is</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.220" end="00:02:57.340" style="s2">you will help right</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.690" end="00:02:59.769" style="s2">well absolutely and that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.340" end="00:03:01.600" style="s2">community used to be and should be at</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.769" end="00:03:03.370" style="s2">least in my opinion I&#39;m with you there</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.600" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">my brother the other thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.370" end="00:03:08.200" style="s2">noticed after we moved there is that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:11.080" style="s2">think there&#39;s something about the very</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.200" end="00:03:13.569" style="s2">low density population in Highland that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.080" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">allows people to be unique the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.569" end="00:03:17.980" style="s2">are each one quite different from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.440" style="s2">other and we found that to be very</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.980" end="00:03:22.120" style="s2">interesting and also probably because</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.440" end="00:03:24.610" style="s2">they don&#39;t interact with people as much</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.120" end="00:03:26.829" style="s2">as people do in more populated areas</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.610" end="00:03:29.350" style="s2">some of them at least are amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.829" end="00:03:31.000" style="s2">talkers in fact we still have our rule</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.350" end="00:03:34.390" style="s2">of thumb don&#39;t talk to acts unless you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.000" end="00:03:36.160" style="s2">got 45 minutes you know and why 90</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.390" end="00:03:39.190" style="s2">minutes and one of our dear friends now</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.160" end="00:03:41.650" style="s2">passed on who very much kept to himself</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.190" end="00:03:43.959" style="s2">it did enjoy company but if you stopped</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.650" end="00:03:46.090" style="s2">in you better have four and a half hours</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.959" end="00:03:47.590" style="s2">and I&#39;m not kidding I could probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.090" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">guess who you were talking about but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.590" end="00:03:50.950" style="s2">know exactly what you mean I just love</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">that about Highland each person is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.950" end="00:03:54.730" style="s2">different and they could tell you some</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:55.450" style="s2">stories now those stories are well worth</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.730" end="00:03:58.329" style="s2">listening to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.450" end="00:04:01.239" style="s2">so what obvious question to ask Beth is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.329" end="00:04:03.250" style="s2">what kind of personal transformation led</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.239" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">you from being I&#39;m presuming knowing you</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.250" end="00:04:09.310" style="s2">pretty well a hard-ass trial lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:11.859" style="s2">becoming a pastor that&#39;s a big cage it</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.310" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">is it&#39;s a radical change the short</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.859" end="00:04:17.260" style="s2">version or the long version of the short</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:20.410" style="s2">version is I was connected with someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.260" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">in my life who was profoundly alcoholic</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.410" end="00:04:25.660" style="s2">if you can be profound an alcoholic at</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">the same time and over time and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.660" end="00:04:30.039" style="s2">course of my own journey I ended up</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:32.740" style="s2">going to a 12-step program and from</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.039" end="00:04:35.580" style="s2">there basically I came to a faith in God</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.740" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">and from that to church</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.580" end="00:04:40.889" style="s2">and then from church to just becoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:42.419" style="s2">more active and feeling like I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.889" end="00:04:44.069" style="s2">supposed to go do this thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.419" end="00:04:45.629" style="s2">thought it was ridiculous so I leased a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.069" end="00:04:47.939" style="s2">sports car because I thought it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.629" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">midlife crisis it was great fun I got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.939" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">tell you everybody should have a sports</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:53.849" style="s2">car at some point in their life</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:58.020" style="s2">especially a convertible but the feeling</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.849" end="00:04:59.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t go away and so I then talked to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.020" end="00:05:02.370" style="s2">friends and trusted loved ones and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.610" end="00:05:04.169" style="s2">nobody laughed and I thought okay maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.370" end="00:05:05.969" style="s2">this is a real thing maybe God really</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.169" end="00:05:08.310" style="s2">wants me to go be a preacher and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.969" end="00:05:09.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what I did very interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.310" end="00:05:11.610" style="s2">mean that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.590" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">transformation it wasn&#39;t what I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.610" end="00:05:15.000" style="s2">looking for that&#39;s when the some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:16.710" style="s2">most interesting journeys in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.000" end="00:05:18.449" style="s2">happen when we take the step that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.710" end="00:05:20.009" style="s2">weren&#39;t expecting boy and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.449" end="00:05:22.139" style="s2">truth and that&#39;s some of the best things</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.009" end="00:05:24.360" style="s2">to particular another thing about our</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.139" end="00:05:25.919" style="s2">County is the place that&#39;s getting older</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.360" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">every year you know I look in the mirror</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:30.270" style="s2">and say it&#39;s happening to me - how</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:33.389" style="s2">could this be what challenges does that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.270" end="00:05:35.159" style="s2">make for a church pastor well I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.389" end="00:05:36.629" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a lot of challenges</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.159" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">with it because you have more deaths and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.629" end="00:05:40.050" style="s2">more health issues and people are slower</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:42.330" style="s2">and less active because they&#39;re in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.050" end="00:05:44.969" style="s2">stage of life but there&#39;s also some real</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.330" end="00:05:47.159" style="s2">blessings I think because I&#39;m I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.969" end="00:05:49.379" style="s2">church not of parents or grandparents</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.159" end="00:05:52.169" style="s2">really bit of great-grandparents and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.379" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">most of them are at the life stage where</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:59.279" style="s2">too much because they&#39;ve seen too much</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.000" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">you know it really is I think a life</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.279" end="00:06:05.490" style="s2">stage kind of a thing and so if I were</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.080" style="s2">with a younger congregation given some</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.490" end="00:06:09.210" style="s2">of my traits they might be judging me</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.080" end="00:06:11.849" style="s2">pretty harshly but these folks they take</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.210" end="00:06:14.190" style="s2">it all in stride and that&#39;s a real gift</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.849" end="00:06:15.509" style="s2">that I appreciate very much and I do</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.190" end="00:06:18.259" style="s2">think that is something that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.509" end="00:06:20.060" style="s2">an older population the W word wisdom</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.310" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2">things not to be worth getting too</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.020" end="00:06:30.990" style="s2">worked up about but probably just as</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:33.300" style="s2">importantly what things are worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.990" end="00:06:35.580" style="s2">getting worked up about boy that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.300" end="00:06:37.949" style="s2">good question isn&#39;t it I&#39;d say in in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.580" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">these folks lives for most part really</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.949" end="00:06:42.000" style="s2">not much of anything you know they pray</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:43.500" style="s2">about folks and they care about folks</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.000" end="00:06:46.259" style="s2">and they do what they can for their</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.500" end="00:06:48.270" style="s2">community but they just don&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.259" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">fussed about too much I haven&#39;t reached</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.270" end="00:06:51.650" style="s2">that level of wisdom you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:53.900" style="s2">but maybe as I keep turning the pages on</p>

<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:06.349" style="s2">find any proof of that but we could</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.190" end="00:07:09.830" style="s2">describe it as the plague of prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.349" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">and spiritual moais did you say some</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.830" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">more about that sure I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:19.580" style="s2">in in our world in the United States as</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:22.569" style="s2">we understand everything from this very</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.539" end="00:07:35.419" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.289" end="00:07:39.289" style="s2">but certainly the Great Gatsby would be</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.120" end="00:08:05.870" style="s2">your belief there&#39;s gonna be natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.039" end="00:08:07.880" style="s2">resources like you couldn&#39;t imagine and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.870" end="00:08:10.490" style="s2">you will not have done a thing to earn</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.880" end="00:08:12.050" style="s2">it I will simply give it to you and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.490" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">it&#39;ll be blessing upon blessing but God</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.050" end="00:08:16.009" style="s2">doesn&#39;t stop there then he says but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:17.870" style="s2">here&#39;s the deal when you get there after</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.009" end="00:08:20.900" style="s2">a while you&#39;re gonna forget me and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.870" end="00:08:23.030" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna say I did this the work of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.900" end="00:08:24.830" style="s2">my hands got me all that I have and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.030" end="00:08:26.270" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna forget me and then the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.830" end="00:08:29.150" style="s2">says one of the scariest things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.270" end="00:08:33.860" style="s2">ever heard for a believer woe to you on</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.150" end="00:08:36.979" style="s2">that day yeah it strikes me that one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.860" end="00:08:41.390" style="s2">the things that happens when you have so</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.979" end="00:08:43.339" style="s2">much that it&#39;s never enough it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.390" end="00:08:46.610" style="s2">trying to fill the hole in the soul with</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.339" end="00:08:48.529" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;s never enough and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.610" end="00:08:51.410" style="s2">like trying to find meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.529" end="00:08:53.329" style="s2">in our stuff and our acquisition and our</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.410" end="00:08:56.959" style="s2">measures of success and it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.329" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">enough and so the needs of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.959" end="00:09:01.970" style="s2">haven&#39;t changed probably from about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:03.290" style="s2">beginning of time but right now we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.970" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">somehow afford to act</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.290" end="00:09:08.120" style="s2">like they aren&#39;t omnipresent because</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:12.230" style="s2">they aren&#39;t on the present for us and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.120" end="00:09:15.079" style="s2">we get bored and we get I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.230" end="00:09:17.600" style="s2">like a low-level depression and we stop</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.079" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">looking for meaning and we stop thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.600" end="00:09:23.089" style="s2">about service and all the other things</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:26.360" style="s2">that we do are just empty calories and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.089" end="00:09:29.449" style="s2">so if I were to diagnose America and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.360" end="00:09:31.310" style="s2">I&#39;m certainly no doctor of any kind but</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.449" end="00:09:32.839" style="s2">if I were I think spiritual malaise</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.310" end="00:09:35.420" style="s2">would be right up there at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.839" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">the list yeah and the way we get there</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.420" end="00:09:39.259" style="s2">something that some friends of mine and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:42.500" style="s2">I we often use the term hedonistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.259" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">treadmill oh you like that one I do I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.500" end="00:09:46.310" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard that I like that a lot yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:48.380" style="s2">the hedonistic treadmill and actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.310" end="00:09:50.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a fair amount of good cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.380" end="00:09:53.810" style="s2">neuroscience to back it up which is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.870" end="00:09:56.509" style="s2">each hit of wonderfulness in our lives</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.810" end="00:09:58.910" style="s2">oh now I spent $1,200 for a dinner in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.509" end="00:10:00.380" style="s2">New York City well guess what the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.910" end="00:10:01.639" style="s2">time it wasn&#39;t that wonderful in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.380" end="00:10:03.470" style="s2">third time you&#39;ve been just as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.639" end="00:10:05.899" style="s2">going off to Hardee&#39;s so now you got to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.470" end="00:10:08.510" style="s2">go to $1,800 to get that same hit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.899" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">wonderfulness and it&#39;s actually built</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.510" end="00:10:14.449" style="s2">into our dopamine and serotonin systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">and so we are all if we let ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.449" end="00:10:19.850" style="s2">stay on it on the hedonistic treadmill</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:23.209" style="s2">and it strikes me that one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.850" end="00:10:25.639" style="s2">features of what our society has to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.209" end="00:10:28.940" style="s2">if we&#39;re not gonna drive our society off</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.639" end="00:10:30.980" style="s2">a ecological ledge here in the next 50</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.940" end="00:10:33.370" style="s2">years has learned how to step away from</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.980" end="00:10:36.800" style="s2">the hedonistic treadmill and to find</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.370" end="00:10:38.779" style="s2">meaning in other things I think that</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.800" end="00:10:40.730" style="s2">sounds pretty wise and I love that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.779" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">phrase it&#39;s so descriptive but as I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.730" end="00:10:44.600" style="s2">listening to you describe the actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">science it also sounds very much like</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.600" end="00:10:49.310" style="s2">addiction processes doesn&#39;t it you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:53.269" style="s2">you need more and more and more it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.310" end="00:10:55.459" style="s2">absolutely is yeah Wow Wow I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.269" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">literally true the other one it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.459" end="00:10:59.660" style="s2">on the annoyance side a little saying I</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:02.089" style="s2">like is if you&#39;re not careful</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:06.319" style="s2">once you become affluent you end up as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.089" end="00:11:09.560" style="s2">janitor to your possessions Wow</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.319" end="00:11:11.720" style="s2">I love that yeah there&#39;s a prayer in</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.560" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">Proverbs on I couldn&#39;t lay my hands on</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.720" end="00:11:14.870" style="s2">it but it&#39;s in the book of Proverbs in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:17.089" style="s2">the Bible and basically what it says is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.870" end="00:11:20.269" style="s2">Lord do not let me have</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.089" end="00:11:24.529" style="s2">two little right that I may resent what</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.269" end="00:11:26.269" style="s2">I don&#39;t have nor too much and we often</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.529" end="00:11:29.269" style="s2">hear that prayer in one form or another</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.269" end="00:11:31.399" style="s2">about not having too little but you very</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.269" end="00:11:34.399" style="s2">seldom hear somebody praying not to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.399" end="00:11:35.809" style="s2">too much yeah man they may win may</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.399" end="00:11:37.669" style="s2">actually be good I will say I&#39;m not the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.809" end="00:11:39.889" style="s2">best in that department I will say my</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.669" end="00:11:41.449" style="s2">wife is a lot better than I am and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.889" end="00:11:43.339" style="s2">a great one for throw it out if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.449" end="00:11:45.799" style="s2">haven&#39;t used it in the last year and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.339" end="00:11:48.529" style="s2">think that&#39;s really important to not let</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.799" end="00:11:50.269" style="s2">oneself be inundated with all this</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.529" end="00:11:51.979" style="s2">of the world in other words you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.269" end="00:11:53.689" style="s2">mentioned in passing which again is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.979" end="00:11:56.659" style="s2">getting a lot of discussion in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.689" end="00:12:00.199" style="s2">circles that I hang out in is meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.659" end="00:12:03.829" style="s2">the M word what do you say meaning what</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.199" end="00:12:06.349" style="s2">does that mean are you being rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.829" end="00:12:09.079" style="s2">or do you want to know I really would</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.349" end="00:12:11.389" style="s2">like to know I suspect that for us in</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.079" end="00:12:12.859" style="s2">our postmodern life that it means</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.389" end="00:12:15.469" style="s2">whatever we wanted to mean if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.859" end="00:12:19.219" style="s2">being quite literal right for me as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.469" end="00:12:21.049" style="s2">person of faith meaning is simply about</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.219" end="00:12:23.569" style="s2">putting God at the center of my life</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.049" end="00:12:24.859" style="s2">because God is the capital M meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.569" end="00:12:28.399" style="s2">course everybody has their own journey</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.859" end="00:12:30.889" style="s2">right and and their own process in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.399" end="00:12:32.659" style="s2">looking for meaning but I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.889" end="00:12:36.319" style="s2">the things that gets thrown away when</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.659" end="00:12:39.139" style="s2">you have so much is you even cast aside</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.319" end="00:12:43.369" style="s2">the journey seeking meaning and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.139" end="00:12:46.759" style="s2">mistake all kinds of other nonsense for</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.369" end="00:12:49.459" style="s2">purpose and I think that whether we</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.759" end="00:12:51.379" style="s2">think of it in an evolutionary way or in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.459" end="00:12:53.329" style="s2">a spiritual way or in some other way I</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.379" end="00:12:56.149" style="s2">can&#39;t even conceive of because my</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.329" end="00:13:00.199" style="s2">imagination is pretty limited that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.149" end="00:13:03.859" style="s2">are we are beings created to explore and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.199" end="00:13:05.149" style="s2">delve into purpose and finitude just one</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.859" end="00:13:07.339" style="s2">piece of that and I think it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.149" end="00:13:07.999" style="s2">the least consequential piece but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.339" end="00:13:10.819" style="s2">just me</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.999" end="00:13:13.039" style="s2">but yeah so meaning is is the journey</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.819" end="00:13:14.539" style="s2">right if you get into the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.039" end="00:13:16.849" style="s2">popular memes of the day not the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.539" end="00:13:19.309" style="s2">destination and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.849" end="00:13:21.139" style="s2">interchangeable with purpose like I said</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.309" end="00:13:23.089" style="s2">for me that question got answered a long</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.139" end="00:13:24.649" style="s2">time ago and it&#39;s God&#39;s right at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.089" end="00:13:27.649" style="s2">middle and then everything else revolves</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.649" end="00:13:29.569" style="s2">around that and you got there by faith I</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.649" end="00:13:30.770" style="s2">presume God didn&#39;t come down and tap you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.569" end="00:13:35.959" style="s2">on the shoulder Dee</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.770" end="00:13:37.700" style="s2">um with in my case kind of so no I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.959" end="00:13:39.649" style="s2">wasn&#39;t looking for God I think God was</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.700" end="00:13:41.750" style="s2">looking for me and I&#39;m not sure why but</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.649" end="00:13:43.670" style="s2">it&#39;s been kind of a fun journey but ya</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.750" end="00:13:45.620" style="s2">know faith is certainly a big piece of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.670" end="00:13:47.209" style="s2">that and thinking about what what faith</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.620" end="00:13:48.980" style="s2">actually means because it means so many</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.209" end="00:13:51.589" style="s2">different things in different contexts</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.980" end="00:13:53.630" style="s2">right yeah because you know I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.589" end="00:13:57.310" style="s2">believer in religion in any conventional</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.630" end="00:14:00.320" style="s2">sense so I really don&#39;t have a solid</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.310" end="00:14:02.750" style="s2">sense of this faith thing but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.320" end="00:14:04.970" style="s2">interested in it so I&#39;d love to have you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.750" end="00:14:09.410" style="s2">articulated as much depth as you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.970" end="00:14:11.360" style="s2">what faith is in your mind and why is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.410" end="00:14:15.170" style="s2">important or what or what is it good for</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.360" end="00:14:16.670" style="s2">either and what is faith good for well</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.170" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">you fortunately you give me a heads up</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.670" end="00:14:22.220" style="s2">on that one and I had a little time to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:23.990" style="s2">reflect the the none of it for me is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.220" end="00:14:25.370" style="s2">actually really short and sweet I can</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.990" end="00:14:28.550" style="s2">certainly and would be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.370" end="00:14:30.770" style="s2">elaborate but I think faith is in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.550" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">religious terms and the way I understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.770" end="00:14:35.630" style="s2">it is simply the acknowledgement of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:40.130" style="s2">reality a reality that is both seen and</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.630" end="00:14:42.829" style="s2">unseen and so Paul writes in in the New</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.130" end="00:14:44.779" style="s2">Testament that faith is the evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.829" end="00:14:46.190" style="s2">things hoped for so faith is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.779" end="00:14:48.529" style="s2">acknowledging that there are things</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.190" end="00:14:50.300" style="s2">beyond the five senses but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.529" end="00:14:51.890" style="s2">particularly helpful because that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.300" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">in every discipline right there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.890" end="00:14:56.990" style="s2">kinds of things we can&#39;t see that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">know are true but even science takes</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.990" end="00:15:00.829" style="s2">certain things as an article of faith</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:03.050" style="s2">unless and until empirical proof has</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.829" end="00:15:05.839" style="s2">been established right with the language</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.050" end="00:15:07.670" style="s2">of what hypothesis so maybe maybe if I</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.839" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">were gonna speak in that language I</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.670" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">would say that faith essentially is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">hypothesis of the experience of God</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.649" style="s2">what&#39;s it good for</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:18.260" style="s2">well it&#39;s the center of everything but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.649" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">the thing is for Christianity which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.260" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">the you know the perspective from which</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.529" style="s2">I come the important thing to remember</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:27.350" style="s2">is that faith isn&#39;t about Creed&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.529" end="00:15:29.260" style="s2">tenants and and propositional statements</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.350" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">nor is it actually about human beings</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.260" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">the point isn&#39;t what I believe in when</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:37.880" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking of faith the first and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:43.100" style="s2">foremost thing is actually the faith of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.880" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">the divine that God is faithful so in in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.100" end="00:15:46.580" style="s2">those scriptures</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.540" end="00:15:49.220" style="s2">historically people aren&#39;t talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.580" end="00:15:51.380" style="s2">God or no God which tends to be the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.220" end="00:15:53.750" style="s2">discussion of our day at that time</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.380" end="00:15:56.180" style="s2">they&#39;re all pretty much thinking yes God</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.750" end="00:15:58.940" style="s2">what is that God are those gods like</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.180" end="00:16:03.230" style="s2">what is their nature or his nature or</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.940" end="00:16:06.050" style="s2">her nature and so the the central kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.230" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">of unifying piece for the Hebrew and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.050" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">Christian scriptures is that God is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:16.490" style="s2">being who is faithful and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:19.520" style="s2">then everything else flows so so what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.490" end="00:16:22.310" style="s2">faith good for for me it is establishing</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.520" end="00:16:24.590" style="s2">the linkage by which I know the nature</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.310" end="00:16:27.770" style="s2">and identity and character of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.590" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">whom I worship and thus know what I am</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.770" end="00:16:33.800" style="s2">made for and how I am to be yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:35.830" style="s2">sure what it&#39;s good for it just is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:38.180" style="s2">whether it&#39;s good for anything or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.830" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">you framed it which I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.180" end="00:16:43.610" style="s2">probably about right as the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.430" end="00:16:44.990" style="s2">of the existence of God in the science</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.610" end="00:16:48.020" style="s2">world typically we&#39;ll start with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.990" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">hypothesis and hypothesis are often not</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.020" end="00:16:52.280" style="s2">confirmed sure so we look for evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.080" style="s2">to build the case for the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.280" end="00:16:56.450" style="s2">what&#39;s the evidence that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.080" end="00:17:01.190" style="s2">accumulated in your journey with respect</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.450" end="00:17:04.460" style="s2">to the existence of God experience so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.190" end="00:17:08.240" style="s2">the scriptures of the Old and New</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.460" end="00:17:11.330" style="s2">Testaments of Judaism and Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.240" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">for me tell the story of God in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.330" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">that is helpful and interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:18.950" style="s2">fascinating but I that&#39;s not how I came</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:21.200" style="s2">to God so so I know the identity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.950" end="00:17:24.170" style="s2">existence of God through encounter and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.200" end="00:17:27.080" style="s2">experience and I encounter God and have</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.170" end="00:17:30.170" style="s2">encountered God in my understanding both</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.080" end="00:17:33.020" style="s2">directly and mediated through other</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.170" end="00:17:35.930" style="s2">people and events in my life most often</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.020" end="00:17:39.470" style="s2">through other people and so you you or I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.930" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">may know people who are have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.470" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">quality we might want to think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:45.230" style="s2">the quality of goodness but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:47.230" style="s2">it the people who just look like they</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.230" end="00:17:49.430" style="s2">are happy and whole unto themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.230" end="00:17:51.920" style="s2">some people may describe them as having</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.430" end="00:17:54.110" style="s2">a light shining from them people with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.920" end="00:17:56.360" style="s2">that inner serenity and contentment and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.110" end="00:17:58.440" style="s2">those folks that I have encountered in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.360" end="00:18:00.629" style="s2">my life have been people of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.440" end="00:18:03.710" style="s2">great and constant and unwavering faith</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.629" end="00:18:06.059" style="s2">and they had something that I wanted and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.710" end="00:18:07.769" style="s2">they shared with me the best they could</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.059" end="00:18:09.240" style="s2">their own journey and experience and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.769" end="00:18:12.360" style="s2">then as I said I&#39;ve had my own</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.240" end="00:18:14.820" style="s2">encounters and so my my credo of faith</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.360" end="00:18:16.769" style="s2">if you will is pretty simple because I</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.820" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">came to faith as an adult I can say I</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.769" end="00:18:21.659" style="s2">have lived my life with God and without</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:24.419" style="s2">God with is better that&#39;s it with is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.659" end="00:18:26.820" style="s2">better and when I say with is better I</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.419" end="00:18:28.860" style="s2">don&#39;t mean my life got better the truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.820" end="00:18:30.830" style="s2">is after I came to faith in God my life</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.860" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">got so much worse you can&#39;t even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.830" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">but I got better and that&#39;s the paradox</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.610" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t about the quality of my</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:41.759" style="s2">circumstances it was about the quality</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.610" end="00:18:45.809" style="s2">of how I experienced my circumstances so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.759" end="00:18:47.399" style="s2">I have that as a very pedestrian feet on</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.809" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">the ground kind of an experience and</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.399" end="00:18:51.419" style="s2">then I&#39;ve had a few experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.710" end="00:18:55.740" style="s2">would be what would the word be I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.419" end="00:18:57.659" style="s2">transcendental you know where you feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.740" end="00:19:00.330" style="s2">like in the Scottish traditions they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.659" end="00:19:02.879" style="s2">talk about thin places meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.330" end="00:19:05.100" style="s2">geographies where the distance between</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.879" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">you and the cosmos where the divine</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.100" end="00:19:08.370" style="s2">resides is so thin you could literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">reach your hand out and touch the face</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.370" end="00:19:15.269" style="s2">of God and so I&#39;ve had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.299" end="00:19:17.419" style="s2">encounters in thin places and those have</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.269" end="00:19:21.090" style="s2">been of course very meaningful to me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.419" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">transformational but the irony is none</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.090" end="00:19:26.779" style="s2">of them came to me to help form my faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:29.399" style="s2">they came after I was a person of faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.779" end="00:19:31.320" style="s2">so they were just part of the encounter</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.399" end="00:19:33.299" style="s2">story and and one or two of them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.320" end="00:19:36.659" style="s2">yelling and cussing at God pretty good I</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.299" end="00:19:40.110" style="s2">got to say but Big Shoulders Devine took</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.659" end="00:19:41.940" style="s2">it so I don&#39;t want to push you on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.110" end="00:19:44.009" style="s2">but would you be willing to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.940" end="00:19:45.899" style="s2">little bit about one or more let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.009" end="00:19:48.470" style="s2">one one of these may be called mystical</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.899" end="00:19:54.149" style="s2">experiences or near encounters with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.470" end="00:19:55.830" style="s2">numinous sure so one was the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.149" end="00:19:57.899" style="s2">one that I was thinking about when I</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.830" end="00:20:00.179" style="s2">said it was yelling at God I was working</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.899" end="00:20:02.820" style="s2">with a group of Christians in another</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.179" end="00:20:06.330" style="s2">worshiping community not my own who were</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.820" end="00:20:08.669" style="s2">in conflict and trying to resolve the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.330" end="00:20:09.629" style="s2">conflict very unsuccessfully and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.669" end="00:20:12.130" style="s2">were quite angry</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.629" end="00:20:14.230" style="s2">and they were ultimately very angry</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.130" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">with me I was representing you know the</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.230" end="00:20:20.620" style="s2">whole and and so it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:22.540" style="s2">challenging time and you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.620" end="00:20:24.160" style="s2">peacenik right and so I&#39;m doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.540" end="00:20:25.570" style="s2">peace and reconciliation work and none</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.160" end="00:20:27.850" style="s2">of it&#39;s working and ultimately none of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.570" end="00:20:30.370" style="s2">it did work at least in from my point of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.850" end="00:20:32.440" style="s2">view about getting reconciliation and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.370" end="00:20:33.220" style="s2">for about three days at one point I</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.440" end="00:20:36.910" style="s2">found myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.220" end="00:20:38.500" style="s2">weeping continuously not like sobbing</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.910" end="00:20:40.900" style="s2">crying but just tears were running down</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.500" end="00:20:43.060" style="s2">my face I&#39;d wake up in the morning tears</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.900" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">I&#39;d go to bed at night tears it they</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.060" end="00:20:47.800" style="s2">just didn&#39;t stop and I actually started</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.180" style="s2">looking stuff up because medieval women</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.800" end="00:20:51.820" style="s2">did this and I always thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.180" end="00:20:54.040" style="s2">kind of creepy frankly and a little like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.820" end="00:20:56.920" style="s2">the hysterical woman in quotes right but</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.040" end="00:20:59.680" style="s2">I just couldn&#39;t stop it and I was quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.920" end="00:21:02.500" style="s2">annoyed as you might imagine as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.680" end="00:21:05.230" style="s2">driving you can imagine it down to 50</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.500" end="00:21:08.710" style="s2">right into McDowell passing the Griffon</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.230" end="00:21:11.260" style="s2">house and God is sitting in the car seat</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.710" end="00:21:12.910" style="s2">beside me not like a guy that you could</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.260" end="00:21:14.260" style="s2">see and physically described but I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.910" end="00:21:19.410" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how to explain it but I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.260" end="00:21:22.030" style="s2">know he&#39;s there and I said and I quote</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.410" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">what the am I supposed to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:27.490" style="s2">this and there was a pause and then I</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">heard a voice very distinctly say love</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.490" end="00:21:33.000" style="s2">them that&#39;s it love them and I said you</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:35.890" style="s2">have got to be kidding me</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.000" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">not another response I look to the car</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.890" end="00:21:40.600" style="s2">seat because I&#39;m talking to someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:42.190" style="s2">who&#39;s sitting there you know and and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.600" end="00:21:43.930" style="s2">said really you&#39;re the God of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.190" end="00:21:47.530" style="s2">universe and that&#39;s what you&#39;ve got for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.930" end="00:21:48.820" style="s2">me love them are you kidding me not</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.530" end="00:21:52.870" style="s2">another word and I said really now</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.820" end="00:21:55.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go radio silent and so and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.870" end="00:21:59.560" style="s2">God stayed radio silent and but what</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.000" end="00:22:02.440" style="s2">happened in that 60 seconds was the two</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.560" end="00:22:04.060" style="s2">tears had stopped I didn&#39;t will them</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.440" end="00:22:07.510" style="s2">come and I didn&#39;t will them to leave and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.060" end="00:22:10.120" style="s2">they had just stopped and so I sighed</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.510" end="00:22:11.980" style="s2">and I said out loud to God and myself</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.120" end="00:22:13.360" style="s2">well that&#39;s what you told me to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.980" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">before and I thought that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.360" end="00:22:18.220" style="s2">already doing but fine that&#39;s what I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:20.200" style="s2">keep doing and I usually don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.220" end="00:22:21.490" style="s2">tell it because because the language</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:23.290" style="s2">actually was part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.490" end="00:22:25.960" style="s2">and most people don&#39;t like to hear that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.290" end="00:22:28.120" style="s2">I cussed at God I wasn&#39;t cussing it</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.960" end="00:22:32.470" style="s2">I was expressing my own frustration if</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.120" end="00:22:35.260" style="s2">anybody needs that caveat but but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.470" end="00:22:37.090" style="s2">the feeling that I was left with was</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.260" end="00:22:39.430" style="s2">that I actually was doing exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.090" end="00:22:41.410" style="s2">was supposed to be doing and that it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.430" end="00:22:43.210" style="s2">painful and it was breaking God&#39;s heart</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.410" end="00:22:45.580" style="s2">but it was how it was going to be and</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.210" end="00:22:47.320" style="s2">I&#39;m not the agent of change if there was</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.580" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">going to be change God would see to it</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.320" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">and I was doing my part simple as that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:54.460" style="s2">but the Train the transcendent piece of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:58.180" style="s2">it was that all of a sudden God was</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.460" end="00:23:00.580" style="s2">riding in the car with me and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.180" end="00:23:01.960" style="s2">it was very comforting I wasn&#39;t looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.580" end="00:23:04.230" style="s2">for comfort I hadn&#39;t even asked for</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.960" end="00:23:06.940" style="s2">comfort I was mad and I was mad at God</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.230" end="00:23:09.160" style="s2">you know that because it was just a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.940" end="00:23:11.950" style="s2">impossible situation but so that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.160" end="00:23:14.710" style="s2">of words to say that that&#39;s one small</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.950" end="00:23:17.320" style="s2">moment in a lifetime but where I just</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.710" end="00:23:21.240" style="s2">you know weird things were happening who</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.320" end="00:23:23.740" style="s2">cries for three days you know me not me</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.240" end="00:23:25.780" style="s2">you could be my witness on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.740" end="00:23:27.190" style="s2">Beth is tough as nails let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.780" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.190" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">and I&#39;m not pretending not at all thank</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.620" style="s2">you for that story that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:37.450" style="s2">powerful and moving story and I really</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.620" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">appreciate you sharing that with us and</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.450" end="00:23:42.820" style="s2">our audience let&#39;s go back to this</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:44.470" style="s2">earlier description of the experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.820" end="00:23:46.420" style="s2">from others you described people have</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.470" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">you know great serenity or you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.420" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">goodness from inside they kind of glows</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.670" end="00:23:54.070" style="s2">to the outside in another part of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:56.230" style="s2">world of people that I deal with these</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.070" end="00:23:58.660" style="s2">people call themselves spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.230" end="00:24:00.310" style="s2">religious and truthfully I argue with</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.660" end="00:24:02.950" style="s2">them all the time in fact I referred</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.310" end="00:24:06.670" style="s2">famously referred to spirituality on</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.950" end="00:24:09.880" style="s2">this show as the S word and I act in</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.670" end="00:24:12.250" style="s2">mock horror that people would claim this</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.880" end="00:24:15.670" style="s2">stuff and I&#39;d say one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.250" end="00:24:18.460" style="s2">people either you believe in a spirit</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.670" end="00:24:20.500" style="s2">why do you call it spirituality or you</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.460" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">don&#39;t but most of them will say no they</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.500" end="00:24:24.850" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in spirits but they can</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:28.090" style="s2">through things like meditation</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.850" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">introspection various bodily practices</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.090" end="00:24:33.370" style="s2">even breathing sometimes psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:37.240" style="s2">drugs some of them I think really do</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.370" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">seem to reach this sense of serenity and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.240" end="00:24:41.980" style="s2">contentedness and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:45.670" style="s2">I will tell you actually do have this</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.980" end="00:24:47.800" style="s2">goodness glow inside to out what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.670" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">take on that well I&#39;m gonna sound like</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.800" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">an obnoxious Christian but I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:54.880" style="s2">God needs me to know he&#39;s there for him</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:57.790" style="s2">to be there so that&#39;s probably where it</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.880" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">begins and ends for me but I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.790" end="00:25:01.750" style="s2">at some stuff thinking about this you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:04.060" style="s2">know spirituality versus religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.750" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">because I tend to I probably tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.060" end="00:25:10.120" style="s2">more like you but there is one one place</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:11.590" style="s2">I remember where was online that I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.120" end="00:25:12.970" style="s2">looking where they defined it a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.590" end="00:25:15.160" style="s2">differently that helped me understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.970" end="00:25:19.240" style="s2">that take you were talking about which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.160" end="00:25:21.850" style="s2">was they defined the terms religious to</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.240" end="00:25:24.430" style="s2">mean having a deity as its object and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.850" end="00:25:26.590" style="s2">spiritual to mean having self as its</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.430" end="00:25:28.270" style="s2">object it&#39;s not a distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.590" end="00:25:29.620" style="s2">particularly appreciate but if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.270" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">the distinction you&#39;re going to make</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.620" end="00:25:33.580" style="s2">between spiritual and religious then I</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.830" style="s2">think it makes a little more sense most</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.580" end="00:25:37.390" style="s2">people around here that I encounter when</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.830" end="00:25:39.280" style="s2">they talk about spiritual but not</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.390" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">religious they actually mean the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.280" end="00:25:42.100" style="s2">opposite of what your friends are</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.470" style="s2">talking about they mean they believe in</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.100" end="00:25:47.050" style="s2">God they just don&#39;t go to church what</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.470" end="00:25:50.440" style="s2">they literally mean is I do my worship</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.050" end="00:25:52.630" style="s2">by myself that&#39;s the thing I have very</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.440" end="00:25:55.900" style="s2">little patience for because by its</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.630" end="00:25:59.050" style="s2">nature and by humanity&#39;s nature we are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.900" end="00:26:01.660" style="s2">communal we&#39;re communal beings do we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.050" end="00:26:03.520" style="s2">know anything from birth maybe to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.660" end="00:26:05.800" style="s2">afraid of falling right we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.520" end="00:26:08.170" style="s2">suckle maybe from birth and very early</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.800" end="00:26:10.060" style="s2">we learned to be afraid of snakes also</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.170" end="00:26:11.920" style="s2">things headed for our head there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.060" end="00:26:15.250" style="s2">but not many but you know we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.920" end="00:26:16.600" style="s2">taught right and so the notion that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.250" end="00:26:18.250" style="s2">I appreciate that I have to be taught to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.600" end="00:26:19.690" style="s2">read I have to be taught how to go to</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.250" end="00:26:22.390" style="s2">the bathroom I have to be taught how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.690" end="00:26:24.250" style="s2">use a fork but but when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.390" end="00:26:26.050" style="s2">religion and faith nobody else has</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.250" end="00:26:28.360" style="s2">anything to teach me well that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.050" end="00:26:31.390" style="s2">like the height of hubris to me frankly</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.360" end="00:26:34.120" style="s2">we learned together and in my tradition</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.390" end="00:26:36.280" style="s2">we worship together we are different as</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.120" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">a group than we are as a series of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.280" end="00:26:40.840" style="s2">individuals even a collective set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:43.000" style="s2">individuals so really when we get to</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.840" end="00:26:45.640" style="s2">that spirituality versus religion thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.000" end="00:26:47.980" style="s2">I don&#39;t know because they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.640" end="00:26:49.990" style="s2">Studies on people who meditate with God</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.980" end="00:26:51.910" style="s2">is the object I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.990" end="00:26:53.290" style="s2">done Studies on meditation of people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.910" end="00:26:54.700" style="s2">simply meditate</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.290" end="00:26:56.700" style="s2">yes they&#39;ve done a lot of them in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.700" end="00:26:59.350" style="s2">Dalai Lama as well but the Dalai Lama</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.700" end="00:27:02.260" style="s2">whether we think of Buddhism as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.350" end="00:27:05.110" style="s2">philosophy or religion it has a center</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.260" end="00:27:07.630" style="s2">that is other than self right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.110" end="00:27:09.970" style="s2">pretty subtle I mean Buddhism can easily</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.630" end="00:27:12.760" style="s2">exist without any sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.970" end="00:27:14.470" style="s2">supernatural and there are forms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.760" end="00:27:15.700" style="s2">Buddhism that do have the supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.470" end="00:27:18.160" style="s2">and there are forms of Buddhism that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.700" end="00:27:19.780" style="s2">don&#39;t so Buddhist meditators could be of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.160" end="00:27:23.470" style="s2">either sort and both of them seem to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.780" end="00:27:26.350" style="s2">have rather similar brain patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.470" end="00:27:28.450" style="s2">fMRI now it&#39;s interesting I&#39;m not aware</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.350" end="00:27:29.830" style="s2">of any research that looked at say two</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.450" end="00:27:31.480" style="s2">different Buddhist traditions that use</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.830" end="00:27:33.730" style="s2">similar techniques some of which were</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.480" end="00:27:35.380" style="s2">theistic at some of which were not right</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.730" end="00:27:37.180" style="s2">right I may have to go back and check</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.380" end="00:27:39.700" style="s2">and see but if I were to hazard a guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.180" end="00:27:41.920" style="s2">probably not cuz you know I will say</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.700" end="00:27:44.200" style="s2">that my own view on such things is</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.920" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening in meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.200" end="00:27:48.760" style="s2">that we are through various techniques</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:50.740" style="s2">pushing our brain rhythms and networks</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.760" end="00:27:53.800" style="s2">into places they usually aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.740" end="00:27:55.480" style="s2">and then our internal confabulate er the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.800" end="00:27:57.670" style="s2">thing in our brain that tells us stories</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.480" end="00:27:58.810" style="s2">to try to make sense of things even when</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.670" end="00:28:00.850" style="s2">things don&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.810" end="00:28:03.430" style="s2">attempts to knit them together into a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.850" end="00:28:05.800" style="s2">story sure and so I would expect them to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.430" end="00:28:08.290" style="s2">be relatively similar whether they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.800" end="00:28:10.660" style="s2">theological or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.290" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">that makes sense yeah that may well be I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.660" end="00:28:16.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know you know they they do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:18.940" style="s2">of studying of monastics in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.540" end="00:28:21.370" style="s2">but of course they obviously have have</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.940" end="00:28:24.400" style="s2">God as the object so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.370" end="00:28:27.790" style="s2">there&#39;s necessarily an other and other</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.400" end="00:28:29.770" style="s2">or not you know in 12-step programs they</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.790" end="00:28:31.240" style="s2">talk about needing a God and frequently</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.770" end="00:28:33.640" style="s2">it&#39;s they don&#39;t care what your God is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.240" end="00:28:39.580" style="s2">but it can&#39;t be yourself so I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.640" end="00:28:43.480" style="s2">suspicious out of that tradition of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.580" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">the the extreme focus on self as the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.480" end="00:28:49.300" style="s2">center of the the personal universe</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.500" style="s2">simply because what&#39;s the saying my best</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.300" end="00:28:54.010" style="s2">thinking&#39;s what got me there in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.500" end="00:28:55.570" style="s2">first place indeed and it may not be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.010" end="00:28:57.130" style="s2">good place sometimes I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.570" end="00:29:00.550" style="s2">that&#39;s the point of the 12-step process</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.130" end="00:29:03.130" style="s2">for sure as a scientific materialist</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.550" end="00:29:05.800" style="s2">realist I actually put forth a third</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.130" end="00:29:08.650" style="s2">perspective okay which is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.800" end="00:29:10.600" style="s2">universe that&#39;s real God spirits all</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.650" end="00:29:12.340" style="s2">that stuff not real stories we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.600" end="00:29:14.800" style="s2">invented for various purposes and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.340" end="00:29:18.040" style="s2">have actually worked for both people and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.800" end="00:29:23.530" style="s2">groups and societies and then this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.040" end="00:29:26.050" style="s2">self is a very curious new relatively</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.530" end="00:29:28.570" style="s2">new thing that is evolved in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.050" end="00:29:31.150" style="s2">universe in the last at most two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.570" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">million years maybe less and it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.150" end="00:29:37.240" style="s2">less substantial than we like to make it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:40.110" style="s2">out to be and it&#39;s much better to put</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.240" end="00:29:42.880" style="s2">the universe first and think of us as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.110" end="00:29:44.290" style="s2">kind of a program that runs on a little</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.880" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">piece of the universe and runs around</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.290" end="00:29:48.880" style="s2">and interacts with the universe oh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:50.950" style="s2">the Borg well when we come together we</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.880" end="00:29:53.740" style="s2">might be the board but as individuals we</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.950" end="00:29:55.630" style="s2">run around individually so I tend to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:57.550" style="s2">the annoyance of my spiritual friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.630" end="00:30:00.130" style="s2">say hey people frankly all your</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.550" end="00:30:01.840" style="s2">spiritual delving is internally for this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.130" end="00:30:04.600" style="s2">truth of that truth it&#39;s just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.840" end="00:30:06.820" style="s2">hallucinations and I tell my religious</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.600" end="00:30:08.800" style="s2">friends that&#39;s just a bunch of kids</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.820" end="00:30:11.410" style="s2">stories to get us over the fear of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.800" end="00:30:13.210" style="s2">dark meaning death and then reality is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.410" end="00:30:15.400" style="s2">we just have the universe out there and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.210" end="00:30:17.050" style="s2">it&#39;s our job to go out there and explore</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.400" end="00:30:18.730" style="s2">it and do something interesting with it</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.050" end="00:30:22.620" style="s2">so I would say that mine is the third</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.730" end="00:30:24.929" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s neither spiritual nor</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.620" end="00:30:27.570" style="s2">but I don&#39;t see any of those is mutually</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.929" end="00:30:30.179" style="s2">exclusive so I don&#39;t know that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.570" end="00:30:32.669" style="s2">really are either/or propositions you</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.179" end="00:30:35.400" style="s2">know they may be but they could just as</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.669" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">easily be both and propositions that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.400" end="00:30:41.789" style="s2">both the universe could be the material</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:44.970" style="s2">whole of which we are a small part we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.789" end="00:30:48.179" style="s2">could yet be an integral part which</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.970" end="00:30:52.830" style="s2">touches on the notion of self right</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.179" end="00:30:55.649" style="s2">I don&#39;t know and there could be the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.830" end="00:30:57.270" style="s2">existence of God in all of that one</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.649" end="00:31:00.049" style="s2">doesn&#39;t negate the other I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.270" end="00:31:01.710" style="s2">necessarily not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.049" end="00:31:03.350" style="s2">philosophically trying to get at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.710" end="00:31:06.210" style="s2">nature of being is exceedingly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.350" end="00:31:08.820" style="s2">and I love to point out the people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.210" end="00:31:11.010" style="s2">logically possible that the universe was</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.820" end="00:31:13.169" style="s2">created 30 seconds ago with all of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.010" end="00:31:15.480" style="s2">memories in place and all the objects in</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.169" end="00:31:18.029" style="s2">motion and motion you cannot disprove</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.480" end="00:31:20.549" style="s2">that and so just because something is</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.029" end="00:31:23.340" style="s2">logically possible to my mind at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.549" end="00:31:26.159" style="s2">doesn&#39;t buy much credibility in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.340" end="00:31:29.899" style="s2">figuring out what is relatively more</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.159" end="00:31:32.279" style="s2">likely to be true and I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.899" end="00:31:34.559" style="s2">grounding is because we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.279" end="00:31:36.750" style="s2">know and we can&#39;t actually prove</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.559" end="00:31:38.429" style="s2">anything at least so I would argue you</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.750" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">may be able to refute me and I&#39;m open to</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.429" end="00:31:42.600" style="s2">hear that because we can&#39;t really prove</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:45.059" style="s2">anything it seems to me to make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.600" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">take one&#39;s faith commitment make them as</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.059" end="00:31:49.409" style="s2">minimal as possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:51.630" style="s2">why because we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.409" end="00:31:55.500" style="s2">talking about the less we say the less</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.630" end="00:31:59.610" style="s2">errors were likely to have ah okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.500" end="00:32:02.429" style="s2">and then also let&#39;s use our experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.610" end="00:32:04.710" style="s2">and our perception and our measurements</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.429" end="00:32:06.919" style="s2">to try to you know rule out as much as</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.710" end="00:32:09.179" style="s2">we can so you know you know my minimal</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.919" end="00:32:11.460" style="s2">metaphysics and those people listen to</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.179" end="00:32:13.140" style="s2">this show know what rut has metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.460" end="00:32:15.210" style="s2">I thought he always says when I hear the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.140" end="00:32:17.850" style="s2">word metaphysics I reach for my pistol</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.210" end="00:32:19.110" style="s2">which I do say because usually when I</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.850" end="00:32:21.480" style="s2">hear someone talking about their</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.110" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">metaphysics this long convoluted what</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.480" end="00:32:24.929" style="s2">the hell where the hell did you get that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:26.700" style="s2">from and when you push them on it you</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.929" end="00:32:28.679" style="s2">say well they just made it up right or</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.700" end="00:32:31.429" style="s2">they found it in some book somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.679" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">made up and so I push for a minimal</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.429" end="00:32:35.280" style="s2">metaphysical commitment and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">commitment is basically the world that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.280" end="00:32:39.179" style="s2">we think is out there</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:41.850" style="s2">is out there the human sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.179" end="00:32:44.490" style="s2">consciousness is a biological phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.850" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">no dis different from digestion in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.490" end="00:32:48.809" style="s2">sometimes I&#39;ll add and often with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:50.549" style="s2">same final output that when we finally</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.809" end="00:32:52.980" style="s2">understand consciousness we&#39;ll find it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.549" end="00:32:55.559" style="s2">a lot less yeah you got it you got it a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.980" end="00:32:58.049" style="s2">lot less mysterious than we think it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.559" end="00:32:59.700" style="s2">that there are no spirits because</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.049" end="00:33:02.760" style="s2">nobody&#39;s ever been able to put one in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.700" end="00:33:05.370" style="s2">bottle and weigh it and so I say my</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.760" end="00:33:08.100" style="s2">minimal metaphysical commitment is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.370" end="00:33:10.169" style="s2">that but being of a scientific mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.100" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">happy to be proven wrong so the day</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.169" end="00:33:13.890" style="s2">somebody can show me there is more that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:15.900" style="s2">I will add it to my metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.890" end="00:33:17.490" style="s2">commitment but until that day I will</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.900" end="00:33:20.160" style="s2">keep my metaphysical commitments as</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.490" end="00:33:22.580" style="s2">small as possible so when when and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.160" end="00:33:27.690" style="s2">God shows up you&#39;ll be like uh-uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.580" end="00:33:29.850" style="s2">I guess for me it&#39;s a I think we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.690" end="00:33:32.040" style="s2">much more agreement maybe than others</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.850" end="00:33:35.580" style="s2">might think everything&#39;s provisional</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.040" end="00:33:38.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t it and and I could be wrong isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.580" end="00:33:41.130" style="s2">a bad credo by which to live so you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.580" end="00:33:42.840" style="s2">my certainties are a few people mistake</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.130" end="00:33:44.280" style="s2">that about me in my case I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.840" end="00:33:46.260" style="s2">about you and yours but me in my case</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.280" end="00:33:50.429" style="s2">because I&#39;m emphatic about everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.260" end="00:33:52.200" style="s2">even when I&#39;m emphatically wrong but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.429" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">once I learned that I&#39;m wrong then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.200" end="00:33:57.900" style="s2">emphatically emphatic about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:34:00.809" style="s2">that I was wrong so you know I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.900" end="00:34:03.210" style="s2">look at it is I live in the material</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.809" end="00:34:05.850" style="s2">world of course I&#39;m a material being of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.210" end="00:34:08.190" style="s2">course I am the sum of my parts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.850" end="00:34:10.740" style="s2">course but I also seem to be in some odd</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.190" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">way something a little bit more and less</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.740" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">at the same time of the sum of my parts</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:17.970" style="s2">and in the 1500s Martin Luther of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:20.480" style="s2">people said and he knew nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.970" end="00:34:23.460" style="s2">quantum physics and I know little</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.480" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">actually said there is nothing so large</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.460" end="00:34:27.300" style="s2">that God is not larger than there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:30.690" style="s2">nothing so small that God is not smaller</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.300" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">than and to me he&#39;s he&#39;s just perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.690" end="00:34:37.320" style="s2">describing that quantum existence right</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">that seems to have no sense relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.320" end="00:34:42.030" style="s2">in many ways at least in our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">storytelling form with with the physical</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.030" end="00:34:46.980" style="s2">and material world and yet we are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:50.040" style="s2">sure that it&#39;s real as in material or</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.980" end="00:34:53.550" style="s2">tangible even if not measurable but</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.040" end="00:34:56.400" style="s2">day to day we know paradox day to day we</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.550" end="00:34:58.200" style="s2">know and count on the existence of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.400" end="00:35:01.020" style="s2">intangible that we can never see or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.200" end="00:35:03.780" style="s2">measure you know we might measure the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.020" end="00:35:07.140" style="s2">scientific impact of love or the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.780" end="00:35:10.230" style="s2">chemically love shows up on a brain scan</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.140" end="00:35:14.910" style="s2">or you know in our bloodstream but to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:17.070" style="s2">define it or to measure it or to explain</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.910" end="00:35:20.670" style="s2">it that becomes the work of the poet&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.070" end="00:35:22.710" style="s2">most of the time and it&#39;s there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.670" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">an indefinable quality and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.710" end="00:35:29.400" style="s2">biologists will tell us that that human</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:31.410" style="s2">beings like any other critter will only</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.400" end="00:35:33.330" style="s2">act out of its self-interest and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.410" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">and yet there are times when we act not</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.330" end="00:35:37.050" style="s2">only not in our own self-interest but</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:38.430" style="s2">even against the interest of our tribe</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.050" end="00:35:42.090" style="s2">or our kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.430" end="00:35:44.010" style="s2">however we define that so maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.090" end="00:35:45.690" style="s2">exceptions prove the rule or maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.010" end="00:35:47.370" style="s2">exceptions prove that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.690" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">there that I can&#39;t see or touch or</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.370" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">quantify but yet and the yet is also an</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:55.890" style="s2">important piece of it you know I love</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:57.860" style="s2">science fiction I I don&#39;t read it as</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.890" end="00:36:00.120" style="s2">much as I can frankly because I&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.860" end="00:36:02.550" style="s2">illiterate in science to understand a</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.120" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">lot of it these days but so you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.550" end="00:36:07.530" style="s2">a Star Trek girl but that&#39;s about as</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.620" end="00:36:12.930" style="s2">deep as I get but isn&#39;t it amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.530" end="00:36:14.820" style="s2">we can imagine worlds that exist in</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.930" end="00:36:16.680" style="s2">parallel or in tandem or in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.820" end="00:36:20.010" style="s2">with our own that we&#39;re not aware of as</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.680" end="00:36:22.530" style="s2">a scientific phenomena but bulkhead at</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.010" end="00:36:23.700" style="s2">being a spiritual phenomena because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.530" end="00:36:26.910" style="s2">think those two are mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.700" end="00:36:29.730" style="s2">and I think maybe that&#39;s more about my</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.910" end="00:36:31.980" style="s2">lack of understanding or my lack of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.730" end="00:36:34.050" style="s2">knowledge so far so I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.980" end="00:36:37.800" style="s2">you Jim but I&#39;m kind of bummed out that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.050" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">I&#39;m 65 or going on 65 only because</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.800" end="00:36:40.830" style="s2">there&#39;s some amazing things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.420" end="00:36:42.390" style="s2">gonna be happening in the next hundred</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.830" end="00:36:44.490" style="s2">years and I&#39;m just not gonna live long</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.390" end="00:36:47.730" style="s2">enough to get to see some of them I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.490" end="00:36:49.230" style="s2">turned 66 so I&#39;ll be a bit older and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.730" end="00:36:51.330" style="s2">there will be some some things I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.230" end="00:36:54.870" style="s2">to find out which I just won&#39;t but I go</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.330" end="00:36:56.310" style="s2">oh well quite literally and I will say</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.870" end="00:36:58.670" style="s2">you know in the last five or six years</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.310" end="00:37:00.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve been taking a pretty deep dive into</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.670" end="00:37:02.430" style="s2">cognitive science and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.750" end="00:37:04.079" style="s2">neuroscience and</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.430" end="00:37:07.890" style="s2">the more I learn there the more I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.079" end="00:37:11.250" style="s2">come to see that these spiritual type</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.890" end="00:37:13.349" style="s2">things seem to be programmed in and when</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.250" end="00:37:17.190" style="s2">I look at the anthropology and history</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.349" end="00:37:19.410" style="s2">of how faith communities have worked to</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.190" end="00:37:21.270" style="s2">establish group cohesion I see a</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.410" end="00:37:23.940" style="s2">perfectly reasonable story of how those</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.270" end="00:37:26.339" style="s2">could have become evolutionarily fixed</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.940" end="00:37:28.680" style="s2">you know that groups shared a belief</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.339" end="00:37:31.049" style="s2">system live together more strongly</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.680" end="00:37:33.980" style="s2">fought together more strongly and fought</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.049" end="00:37:36.720" style="s2">with each other less and reproduced more</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.980" end="00:37:40.109" style="s2">let me ask you then so does the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.720" end="00:37:43.079" style="s2">biological truth of something or its</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.109" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">sensibility negate its its spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.079" end="00:37:47.849" style="s2">reality one just doesn&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:49.770" style="s2">any impact on the other to me yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.849" end="00:37:51.990" style="s2">would say they don&#39;t Frank and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.770" end="00:37:53.940" style="s2">my general refutation is well if</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.990" end="00:37:55.559" style="s2">religion makes us good it must be true</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.940" end="00:37:57.510" style="s2">then I say well does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.559" end="00:38:06.329" style="s2">because Santa Claus makes four-year-olds</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.510" end="00:38:09.869" style="s2">good Santa Claus is true yes all right</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.329" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">the trial lawyer comes back and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.869" end="00:38:16.289" style="s2">child and the child who love Santa Claus</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:18.150" style="s2">on Christmas yeah yeah yeah but if I use</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.289" end="00:38:19.710" style="s2">that as my standard refutation to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.150" end="00:38:21.150" style="s2">line of argument which is just cuz it</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.710" end="00:38:23.549" style="s2">makes us good or even that it works or</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.150" end="00:38:26.190" style="s2">is biologically good for us doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.549" end="00:38:28.109" style="s2">it&#39;s true in an objective sense but it</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.190" end="00:38:30.029" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.109" end="00:38:31.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not yeah yeah it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.029" end="00:38:33.240" style="s2">not just like I cannot prove the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.260" end="00:38:35.160" style="s2">universe wasn&#39;t created 30 seconds ago</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.240" end="00:38:36.900" style="s2">and I will say that I think you and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.160" end="00:38:39.329" style="s2">are very similar in this regard the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.900" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">I describe my views is strongly stated</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.329" end="00:38:45.779" style="s2">but lightly held I like that I sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:48.420" style="s2">sound pretty ferocious about things but</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.779" end="00:38:50.369" style="s2">I have on several occasions turned coat</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.420" end="00:38:53.010" style="s2">and gone to the other side if I see the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.369" end="00:38:55.109" style="s2">evidence and so I hope to remain that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:38:57.270" style="s2">way to the end you know hope I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.109" end="00:38:58.859" style="s2">become a crotchety old curmudgeon who</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.270" end="00:39:00.750" style="s2">will never change their mind but</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.859" end="00:39:02.190" style="s2">sometimes I do bark a lot more than I</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:03.990" style="s2">bite and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.190" end="00:39:05.609" style="s2">wrong with that really I was also glad</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.990" end="00:39:08.279" style="s2">that you said you were a Star Trek girl</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.609" end="00:39:10.349" style="s2">that means we&#39;re the same tribe one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.279" end="00:39:12.900" style="s2">my big divisions of the world is between</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.349" end="00:39:15.050" style="s2">Star Trek people and Star Wars people oh</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.900" end="00:39:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s no contest yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.050" end="00:39:19.040" style="s2">not at all how could anybody be a Star</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.210" end="00:39:22.700" style="s2">Wars person but they&#39;re out there by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.040" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">bazillion sir absolutely no that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.700" end="00:39:26.260" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe a generational thing but</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:28.460" style="s2">yeah I like to think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.260" end="00:39:30.170" style="s2">thoughtfulness thing but that&#39;s just me</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.460" end="00:39:32.390" style="s2">being obnoxious did you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.170" end="00:39:34.510" style="s2">new Star Trek thing out the new Picard</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.390" end="00:39:37.010" style="s2">series that take yes the next-generation</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.510" end="00:39:39.710" style="s2">storyline up to a new level I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.010" end="00:39:41.240" style="s2">watching yeah yeah it&#39;s fabulous we</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.710" end="00:39:42.650" style="s2">haven&#39;t started it yet we got a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.240" end="00:39:44.210" style="s2">other streaming shows that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.650" end="00:39:45.650" style="s2">watching but it&#39;s on our list I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.210" end="00:39:47.780" style="s2">to hear that it&#39;s good I figured it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.650" end="00:39:50.120" style="s2">probably would let&#39;s take another little</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.780" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">different turn here and maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.120" end="00:39:54.530" style="s2">surprising from the previous line of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:57.050" style="s2">comments of mine at least is into</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.530" end="00:39:59.720" style="s2">theology one of the things you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.050" end="00:40:02.570" style="s2">is that within your religious tradition</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.720" end="00:40:04.970" style="s2">it happens as a group I will confess</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.570" end="00:40:07.190" style="s2">having been raised a Catholic which I</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.970" end="00:40:09.680" style="s2">rejected after having an epiphany when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.190" end="00:40:11.600" style="s2">was 11 that the whole damn show was</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.680" end="00:40:13.850" style="s2">something made up by humans that control</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.600" end="00:40:17.300" style="s2">other humans our view was that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.850" end="00:40:20.000" style="s2">Protestants claimed that religion was a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.300" end="00:40:22.850" style="s2">personal thing and not a corporate thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:24.350" style="s2">could you unpack that minute yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.850" end="00:40:26.330" style="s2">11 years old last time I heard any</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.350" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">Catholicism so I probably misinterpreted</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.330" end="00:40:31.100" style="s2">it but you know would you compare that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">Catholic view on Protestantism versus</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.100" end="00:40:36.590" style="s2">your claim that you see your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:39.740" style="s2">religion as community based or</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.590" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">collective well I think that I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.740" end="00:40:43.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a fair critique from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:45.530" style="s2">Catholic Church towards Protestantism</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.100" end="00:40:47.360" style="s2">and my Methodist friends are gonna call</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.530" end="00:40:50.270" style="s2">and complain but I&#39;m going to blame John</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.360" end="00:40:53.060" style="s2">Wesley the founder of Methodism for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.270" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">notion of individuality and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.060" end="00:40:57.740" style="s2">religious experience so out of out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:40:59.540" style="s2">his own spiritual journey</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.740" end="00:41:03.230" style="s2">John Wesley comes up with a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.540" end="00:41:05.450" style="s2">things that are I say from my point of</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.230" end="00:41:07.160" style="s2">view good in and of themselves but get</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.450" end="00:41:09.110" style="s2">taken to a place never intended to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.160" end="00:41:11.060" style="s2">taken particularly with the American</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.110" end="00:41:12.970" style="s2">experiment that is our Republic so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.060" end="00:41:15.470" style="s2">a confluence of events</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.970" end="00:41:18.680" style="s2">pietism is the first thing personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.470" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">piety an emphasis on good behavior</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.680" end="00:41:23.900" style="s2">so in Methodism which is not my</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.300" style="s2">tradition the path of salvation is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.900" end="00:41:28.580" style="s2">perfectibility of the human being that</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.300" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">we are capable of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.580" end="00:41:34.250" style="s2">and that our journey is one ever toward</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:39.500" style="s2">that and our practices of personal piety</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.250" end="00:41:42.110" style="s2">are what get us there and so that really</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.500" end="00:41:44.840" style="s2">does emphasize individual not</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.110" end="00:41:46.220" style="s2">necessarily experience but individual</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.840" end="00:41:49.100" style="s2">behavior you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.220" end="00:41:51.260" style="s2">and so then couple that then with</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.100" end="00:41:52.640" style="s2">Methodism growing in the Americas and</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.260" end="00:41:54.260" style="s2">particularly in North America and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.640" end="00:41:57.890" style="s2">particularly in the United States and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.260" end="00:41:59.780" style="s2">what you have is with the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.890" end="00:42:01.340" style="s2">and post enlightenment creation of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.780" end="00:42:03.230" style="s2">Republic and recognition of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.340" end="00:42:06.770" style="s2">individual citizen up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.230" end="00:42:08.540" style="s2">right this odd combination so we start</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.770" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">talking about separation of church and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.540" end="00:42:13.400" style="s2">state to mean one thing and then by the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:15.770" style="s2">time we come along it ends up meaning</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.400" end="00:42:19.880" style="s2">what I think about my god is nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.770" end="00:42:22.490" style="s2">business but mine and that&#39;s a direction</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.880" end="00:42:23.900" style="s2">that John Wesley never intended and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.490" end="00:42:26.120" style="s2">believe it&#39;s not what the founding</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.900" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">fathers were thinking about without</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.120" end="00:42:31.880" style="s2">getting into a whole political discourse</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:33.770" style="s2">but so you have these strains where that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.880" end="00:42:34.970" style="s2">critique from Catholicism is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.770" end="00:42:37.640" style="s2">quite fair</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.970" end="00:42:40.310" style="s2">and so you see particularly in the 50s I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.640" end="00:42:41.900" style="s2">think in the 60s the good Protestant is</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.310" end="00:42:43.940" style="s2">the one who&#39;s going to church on Sunday</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.900" end="00:42:47.120" style="s2">and then cutting whatever business deal</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.940" end="00:42:49.610" style="s2">he or she wishes to on Monday and being</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.120" end="00:42:51.590" style="s2">a good person to their family being a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.610" end="00:42:53.930" style="s2">good Christian becoming defined as how</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.590" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">you treat your family as opposed to how</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.930" end="00:42:57.140" style="s2">you treat your world so we lose that</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:43:00.830" style="s2">sense of what you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.140" end="00:43:04.010" style="s2">earlier that universality right and that</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.830" end="00:43:06.260" style="s2">was never part of the deal so within</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.010" end="00:43:08.200" style="s2">historical Protestantism and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.260" end="00:43:12.410" style="s2">as I understand it as a Presbyterian</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.200" end="00:43:14.810" style="s2">there is an emphasis on individual the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.410" end="00:43:17.000" style="s2">state of the individual soul so in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.810" end="00:43:18.740" style="s2">Presbyterianism which gets into</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.000" end="00:43:21.530" style="s2">predestination which is a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.740" end="00:43:24.470" style="s2">debate or argument but the emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.530" end="00:43:26.990" style="s2">there is on you don&#39;t need to worry</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.470" end="00:43:29.540" style="s2">about the state of your soul it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.990" end="00:43:31.610" style="s2">counter critique of Catholicism that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.540" end="00:43:32.860" style="s2">must be continuously worried about</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.610" end="00:43:35.150" style="s2">whether you&#39;re going to hell and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.860" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">continuously doing all these deeds that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.150" end="00:43:38.840" style="s2">are prescribed or else you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:41.660" style="s2">slip into hell even accidentally it</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.840" end="00:43:42.289" style="s2">seems and so John Calvin is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.660" end="00:43:44.630" style="s2">give everybody</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.289" end="00:43:46.189" style="s2">pastor ole word of comfort to say there</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.630" end="00:43:47.959" style="s2">is only one soul you need to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.189" end="00:43:49.989" style="s2">and lucky for you it&#39;s the one you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.959" end="00:43:52.459" style="s2">something about and it is your own and</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.989" end="00:43:54.259" style="s2">but once you know that you are in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.459" end="00:43:56.839" style="s2">relationship with God it&#39;s all good</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.259" end="00:43:58.429" style="s2">because God will never let you go you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.839" end="00:43:59.959" style="s2">don&#39;t need to worry about Timmy&#39;s soul</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.429" end="00:44:02.179" style="s2">Timmy&#39;s soul is between Timmy and God</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.959" end="00:44:04.009" style="s2">and you have no say about that but you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.179" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2">can have comfort about the state of your</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.009" end="00:44:08.089" style="s2">own soul because God has chosen you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:10.729" style="s2">grabbed ahold of you and under no</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.089" end="00:44:12.979" style="s2">circumstances will let you go like all</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.729" end="00:44:15.949" style="s2">good things of course it gets taken and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.979" end="00:44:19.009" style="s2">twisted around too but the individuality</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.949" end="00:44:21.169" style="s2">of that pastoral reassurance your good</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.009" end="00:44:23.630" style="s2">quit worrying about it was meant to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.169" end="00:44:26.029" style="s2">so now you can go out and serve the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.630" end="00:44:28.249" style="s2">in freedom and gratitude without</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.029" end="00:44:31.910" style="s2">worrying about heaven or hell that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.249" end="00:44:32.929" style="s2">already taken care of but you still are</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.910" end="00:44:34.849" style="s2">part of a community</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.929" end="00:44:37.489" style="s2">hence Presbyterians for example we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.849" end="00:44:39.229" style="s2">just one example of many are the gift</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.489" end="00:44:41.029" style="s2">errs and I know people will argue with</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.229" end="00:44:43.849" style="s2">that today too but the gift errs of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.029" end="00:44:46.719" style="s2">notion of public education and of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.849" end="00:44:50.749" style="s2">notion of hospitals in their modern form</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.719" end="00:44:52.459" style="s2">because and that&#39;s the the main mission</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.749" end="00:44:55.219" style="s2">you&#39;ll see from Presbyterians all over</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.459" end="00:44:59.299" style="s2">the world even today is the idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.219" end="00:45:02.299" style="s2">is our duty to share whatever we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.299" end="00:45:05.809" style="s2">with other people and it is our</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.299" end="00:45:08.509" style="s2">privilege to share whatever we have with</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.809" end="00:45:10.219" style="s2">other people so it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.509" end="00:45:12.289" style="s2">a rule by which we&#39;re supposed to live</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.219" end="00:45:15.169" style="s2">it&#39;s also something that we get to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.289" end="00:45:17.150" style="s2">out of gratitude because God has been so</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.169" end="00:45:19.699" style="s2">gracious to us both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.150" end="00:45:21.619" style="s2">collectively so it&#39;s not accidental that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.699" end="00:45:24.229" style="s2">for every Christian tradition that</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.619" end="00:45:27.019" style="s2">participates in the Eucharist the Lord&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.229" end="00:45:29.390" style="s2">Supper communion that it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.019" end="00:45:32.929" style="s2">Thanksgiving the communion communion</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.390" end="00:45:35.419" style="s2">means together so again in a literal</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.929" end="00:45:38.809" style="s2">sense you can&#39;t have a communion meal</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.419" end="00:45:42.979" style="s2">alone it is by definition a shared meal</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.809" end="00:45:45.919" style="s2">and the shared meal has Jesus as its</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.979" end="00:45:48.409" style="s2">object and it&#39;s subject but it&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.919" end="00:45:50.599" style="s2">and Jesus my only boyfriend hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.409" end="00:45:54.259" style="s2">somewhere together it is me and Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.599" end="00:45:56.150" style="s2">and the community so in community I hear</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.259" end="00:45:59.779" style="s2">the voice of God it</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.150" end="00:46:02.119" style="s2">is a check on my individual tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.779" end="00:46:03.859" style="s2">go off into my own lala land and think</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.119" end="00:46:06.859" style="s2">oh well God&#39;s telling me to blow up the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.859" end="00:46:08.750" style="s2">planet because no it&#39;s not the voice of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.859" end="00:46:12.470" style="s2">God if my community of faith isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.750" end="00:46:14.059" style="s2">hearing it too it&#39;s just me indulging in</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.470" end="00:46:17.750" style="s2">something that&#39;s about me and not about</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.059" end="00:46:21.980" style="s2">God so the community is a literal check</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.750" end="00:46:23.930" style="s2">on on my excesses or my tendencies to</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.980" end="00:46:27.020" style="s2">worship myself by mistake and call that</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.930" end="00:46:31.039" style="s2">God the community is where I celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.020" end="00:46:33.500" style="s2">and experience God most seriously Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.039" end="00:46:35.029" style="s2">literally says and this is how Church is</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.500" end="00:46:38.299" style="s2">established or the notion of Church</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.029" end="00:46:42.109" style="s2">wherever two or more of you are gathered</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.299" end="00:46:44.270" style="s2">there I am and so he doesn&#39;t call people</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.109" end="00:46:46.549" style="s2">one by one he calls people to follow him</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.270" end="00:46:50.119" style="s2">in all these groups and he gathers</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.549" end="00:46:52.010" style="s2">groups around him all the time and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.119" end="00:46:54.470" style="s2">you know we come from the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.010" end="00:46:57.260" style="s2">and I guess we don&#39;t appreciate that as</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.470" end="00:46:59.059" style="s2">postmodern Westerners but the Middle</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.260" end="00:47:01.880" style="s2">Eastern cultured almost doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.059" end="00:47:05.029" style="s2">have a conception of I as opposed to we</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.880" end="00:47:06.619" style="s2">and so that can play itself out in some</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.029" end="00:47:10.010" style="s2">ways that are particularly unattractive</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.619" end="00:47:13.220" style="s2">too but there is very much a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.010" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">identity is communal even existence is</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.220" end="00:47:18.589" style="s2">communal because in a desert you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:20.809" style="s2">survive by yourself you just can&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.589" end="00:47:23.569" style="s2">so there was a practical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.809" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">of that that also played it out itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.569" end="00:47:29.450" style="s2">out in the spiritual realm the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:33.230" style="s2">of the Holocaust particularly for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.450" end="00:47:37.069" style="s2">Jews is not just what we think of as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.230" end="00:47:38.960" style="s2">enormity of numbers it is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.069" end="00:47:42.049" style="s2">for my family you might wipe out my</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.960" end="00:47:44.980" style="s2">family if you kill me you kill the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.049" end="00:47:47.630" style="s2">Jewish family by killing the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.980" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">because it is that understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.630" end="00:47:53.720" style="s2">communal identity and descendants right</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:56.630" style="s2">and continuity of line both spiritually</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.720" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">as well as physically so we come from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.630" end="00:48:01.940" style="s2">tradition that is if we want to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:04.760" style="s2">tribal but definitely communal in nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.940" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">God refers to God&#39;s self in the Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.760" end="00:48:10.010" style="s2">Bible more than once as we sow is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:12.530" style="s2">multiple gods or is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.010" end="00:48:14.060" style="s2">the Royal we or is that an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.530" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">like a Christian might say of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.060" end="00:48:20.870" style="s2">Trinitarian understanding of a unity of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.180" end="00:48:23.030" style="s2">of selves that make up the whole but</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.870" end="00:48:25.130" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s a whole bunch of jumping</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.030" end="00:48:29.060" style="s2">around but to simply say that there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.130" end="00:48:31.670" style="s2">no there just is no possibility of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.060" end="00:48:34.460" style="s2">a Christian without being in a community</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.670" end="00:48:36.590" style="s2">I think I was very well said I think I</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.460" end="00:48:39.560" style="s2">think in a very important thing because</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.590" end="00:48:41.660" style="s2">we are communal right even with all of</p>

<p begin="00:51:13.560" end="00:51:18.150" style="s2">fearing that okay the second thing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.620" end="00:51:20.340" style="s2">remember is John Calvin is a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.150" end="00:51:22.860" style="s2">that&#39;s important to the story because of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.340" end="00:51:26.730" style="s2">the nature of lawyers lawyers are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.860" end="00:51:30.120" style="s2">speculative by nature so when you come</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.730" end="00:51:32.550" style="s2">in to see a doctor a doctor may you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.120" end="00:51:33.960" style="s2">you come in for your foot and your</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.550" end="00:51:35.850" style="s2">doctor may say you know you look at you</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.960" end="00:51:38.490" style="s2">a little yellow in the eyes a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.850" end="00:51:40.350" style="s2">never does that you come in for a will a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.490" end="00:51:42.330" style="s2">lawyers not gonna say oh do you need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.350" end="00:51:43.830" style="s2">adopt a kid while you&#39;re here did you</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.330" end="00:51:46.200" style="s2">have a car wreck should we be suing</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.830" end="00:51:47.580" style="s2">somebody no you came for an in for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.200" end="00:51:49.890" style="s2">will we&#39;ll deal with the will see you</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.580" end="00:51:51.720" style="s2">later bye they deal with what&#39;s in front</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.890" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">of them that is who John Calvin is very</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.720" end="00:51:57.450" style="s2">much he&#39;s not a theologian he&#39;s a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:51:59.700" style="s2">who writes a lot about what he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.450" end="00:52:02.580" style="s2">but he is not a theologian he does not</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.700" end="00:52:04.620" style="s2">develop a coherent systemic school of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.580" end="00:52:06.870" style="s2">thought he deals with the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.620" end="00:52:08.430" style="s2">were before him and the problem that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.870" end="00:52:10.860" style="s2">before him is that people were</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.430" end="00:52:12.600" style="s2">frightened out of their minds literally</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.860" end="00:52:14.370" style="s2">people would not take communion because</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.600" end="00:52:17.010" style="s2">they were afraid to take it because they</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.370" end="00:52:18.600" style="s2">take it wrong they&#39;d go to hell this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.010" end="00:52:23.340" style="s2">the world in which he is living right</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.600" end="00:52:27.330" style="s2">and so his point is grace is what saves</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.340" end="00:52:29.520" style="s2">us and grace is God&#39;s gift to us that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.330" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">it&#39;s God&#39;s out of God&#39;s goodness that</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:36.890" style="s2">our unity with God is possible right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:39.770" style="s2">so from that he reasons and it mostly</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.890" end="00:52:42.950" style="s2">his reasoning that you have this notion</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.770" end="00:52:46.250" style="s2">that God chooses and so what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.950" end="00:52:48.290" style="s2">is okay Beth you believe in God you</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.250" end="00:52:51.050" style="s2">believe Jesus Christ yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.290" end="00:52:53.210" style="s2">well that&#39;s because God planted that in</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.050" end="00:52:54.920" style="s2">your heart and what God plants in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.210" end="00:52:56.980" style="s2">heart is never gonna be uprooted so quit</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.920" end="00:53:00.830" style="s2">worrying about it it&#39;s not gonna go away</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.980" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all good you can relax and do what</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.830" end="00:53:06.140" style="s2">God wants you to and so we do what God</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:08.510" style="s2">wants us to not out of fear of Hell and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.140" end="00:53:11.480" style="s2">nor out of desire for heaven but because</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.510" end="00:53:13.100" style="s2">God wants us to do it and so when folks</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.480" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">talk about well you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.100" end="00:53:20.690" style="s2">license to sin I would say to you that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:22.790" style="s2">when I was 12 15 maybe even 20 I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.690" end="00:53:26.990" style="s2">murder somebody or steal because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.790" end="00:53:28.490" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to go to jail I&#39;m 65 I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.990" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">murder people because I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.490" end="00:53:33.470" style="s2">murder people I don&#39;t steal because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.300" style="s2">don&#39;t want to steal and a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.470" end="00:53:37.130" style="s2">reason I don&#39;t want to steal is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.300" end="00:53:39.850" style="s2">I understand it to be hurtful to my</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.130" end="00:53:42.920" style="s2">community and thus wrong in God&#39;s world</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.850" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">because anything that does harm is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.920" end="00:53:48.190" style="s2">broadly speaking I don&#39;t need a great</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:50.960" style="s2">big rulebook all the time in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.190" end="00:53:52.580" style="s2">because I have some wisdom I say it</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.960" end="00:53:56.330" style="s2">comes from God maybe it just comes from</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.580" end="00:53:58.970" style="s2">age I don&#39;t know but only a child or</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.330" end="00:54:01.970" style="s2">someone who stays as a child obeys rules</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.970" end="00:54:03.890" style="s2">out of fear of consequences adults obey</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.970" end="00:54:05.390" style="s2">rules because the rules make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.890" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">they choose to disobey them when they</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.390" end="00:54:11.060" style="s2">don&#39;t so then to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:12.860" style="s2">predestination it&#39;s not that anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.060" end="00:54:15.050" style="s2">running toward heaven or running from</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.860" end="00:54:17.450" style="s2">Hell it&#39;s just to relax into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.050" end="00:54:20.090" style="s2">existence that you have and know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.450" end="00:54:24.290" style="s2">because God has chosen you and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.090" end="00:54:26.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t choose God then you can&#39;t undo so</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.290" end="00:54:28.400" style="s2">if you flash forward because then</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.390" end="00:54:30.680" style="s2">problems develop with that because then</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.400" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">some later Presbyterians say oh that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.680" end="00:54:34.310" style="s2">means that God chose some people to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.300" end="00:54:37.310" style="s2">to hell that&#39;s not what Calvin was</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.310" end="00:54:40.370" style="s2">talking about but then you flash-forward</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.310" end="00:54:43.250" style="s2">to the 20th century and German</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.370" end="00:54:45.470" style="s2">theologian named carl bart VAR th says I</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.250" end="00:54:47.840" style="s2">think Calvin got it right about God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.470" end="00:54:50.390" style="s2">choosing election is what that means in</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.840" end="00:54:52.430" style="s2">in the theological words but he said</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.390" end="00:54:54.650" style="s2">I think he got it wrong who and what God</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.430" end="00:54:55.849" style="s2">was choosing and this is where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.650" end="00:54:59.869" style="s2">the most sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.849" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">Carl Bart says God chooses yes and God</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.869" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">is a choosing God by nature God chooses</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:07.400" style="s2">a and thus not B but when when it got to</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:09.940" style="s2">the point in Calvinism that it&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.400" end="00:55:13.730" style="s2">well a and not B is Beth and not Jim</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.940" end="00:55:16.750" style="s2">no no no no what God chose was God&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.730" end="00:55:19.549" style="s2">self that is Jesus Christ on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.750" end="00:55:23.390" style="s2">so the election or the choice that God</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.549" end="00:55:26.059" style="s2">makes is I will die for all of you that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.390" end="00:55:28.910" style="s2">you might live so the election or the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.059" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">choosing that is predestined for</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.910" end="00:55:34.130" style="s2">salvation that is unification with God</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:36.680" style="s2">is the choice that I will make the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.130" end="00:55:38.750" style="s2">sacrifice so you don&#39;t have to because</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.680" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">you can&#39;t but I can</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.750" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">and thus I will and so at some place</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:48.140" style="s2">it&#39;s reputed to be said I can&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:50.299" style="s2">so I can&#39;t verify to that bartman said</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.140" end="00:55:53.569" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not a Universalist but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.299" end="00:55:55.609" style="s2">pretty sure God is and so that actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.569" end="00:55:58.730" style="s2">makes sense to me that if God is</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.609" end="00:56:01.220" style="s2">choosing then it is not Cindy and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.730" end="00:56:03.650" style="s2">Suzy know that that&#39;s so arbitrary that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.220" end="00:56:06.740" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even make sense but it is God is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.650" end="00:56:08.509" style="s2">choosing all of humanity this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.740" end="00:56:09.200" style="s2">creation that God made for who knows</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.509" end="00:56:11.599" style="s2">what reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.200" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">in some ineffable way to be in God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.599" end="00:56:15.980" style="s2">image and has chosen that we will be</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">redeemed</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.980" end="00:56:21.470" style="s2">because God has decided we are worth</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:24.529" style="s2">redeeming we may not be worth redeeming</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.470" end="00:56:26.630" style="s2">in any empirical measurable sense but if</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.529" end="00:56:28.400" style="s2">God is God and God&#39;s decided then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.630" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">the end of the conversation so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.400" end="00:56:34.490" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty destination is getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:37.670" style="s2">at the idea of stop worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.490" end="00:56:40.700" style="s2">whether your quote saved unquote and</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.670" end="00:56:42.710" style="s2">stop you know listening to everybody ask</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.700" end="00:56:44.809" style="s2">you the right litmus test questions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.710" end="00:56:46.400" style="s2">see if you pass the test because I have</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.809" end="00:56:49.190" style="s2">stories about that too that are horrific</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.400" end="00:56:51.049" style="s2">and just start relaxing into the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.190" end="00:56:54.590" style="s2">enormity of God&#39;s love for you and live</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.049" end="00:56:56.030" style="s2">it how hard is that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.590" end="00:56:57.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a story I like that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.030" end="00:56:58.930" style="s2">threat does that mean Presbyterians</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.590" end="00:57:01.850" style="s2">believe nobody goes to hell</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.930" end="00:57:04.370" style="s2">some this Presbyterian believes there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.850" end="00:57:06.980" style="s2">no hell that if there ever was one that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.370" end="00:57:08.510" style="s2">Jesus redeemed it and it&#39;s over that if</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.980" end="00:57:09.740" style="s2">there was a battle it was a cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.510" end="00:57:12.230" style="s2">battle and it was fought on the cross</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.740" end="00:57:14.390" style="s2">and Jesus wanted and when you win it</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.230" end="00:57:18.440" style="s2">that kind of a battle it&#39;s once and for</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.390" end="00:57:19.640" style="s2">all time Satan and God so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:22.010" style="s2">fight left to be fought</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.640" end="00:57:23.480" style="s2">there&#39;s just the after effects like</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.010" end="00:57:25.610" style="s2">aftershocks in an earthquake</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.480" end="00:57:29.030" style="s2">so Satan&#39;s still sort of hanging around</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.610" end="00:57:31.730" style="s2">causing trouble I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.030" end="00:57:35.150" style="s2">believe in the devil in the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.730" end="00:57:37.730" style="s2">figure that people describe is almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.150" end="00:57:40.660" style="s2">co-equal with God I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.730" end="00:57:42.680" style="s2">nonsense but if you read the book of Job</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.660" end="00:57:44.210" style="s2">ironically one of my favorite books in</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.680" end="00:57:45.260" style="s2">all of the Bible it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.210" end="00:57:48.800" style="s2">difficult ones</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.260" end="00:57:52.460" style="s2">it begins with Satan as the figure of an</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.800" end="00:57:54.290" style="s2">advocate ironically a lawyer he&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:57:54.290" end="00:57:59.030" style="s2">comes back as kind of God&#39;s emissary and</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:01.730" style="s2">gives him the reports and so as the play</p>

<p begin="00:58:19.250" end="00:58:22.670" style="s2">because there&#39;s an add-on later which</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.870" end="00:58:24.920" style="s2">disappoints me but the real ending of</p>

<p begin="00:58:46.190" end="00:58:50.660" style="s2">exactly what Jobe does basically he says</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.470" end="00:58:53.720" style="s2">he falls down in the dust and basically</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.660" end="00:58:57.620" style="s2">says my Lord and my god every question</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.720" end="00:59:01.160" style="s2">he had disappears because God simply</p>

<p begin="00:59:01.160" end="00:59:03.860" style="s2">have all these questions well how does</p>

<p begin="00:59:03.860" end="00:59:07.900" style="s2">why do these children die why why why</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.750" end="00:59:09.880" style="s2">and all the sudden this holy</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.900" end="00:59:11.410" style="s2">being that I can&#39;t even imagine let</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.880" end="00:59:15.039" style="s2">alone comprehend is just standing there</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.410" end="00:59:17.319" style="s2">and saying hello the questions become</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.039" end="00:59:20.049" style="s2">immaterial is is the takeaway I have</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.319" end="00:59:22.779" style="s2">from that so the satan figure is there</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.049" end="00:59:26.279" style="s2">ultimately to provoke the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.779" end="00:59:28.900" style="s2">he is a device a literary device and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.279" end="00:59:31.089" style="s2">whether there&#39;s an actual being like</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.900" end="00:59:33.549" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know most of the time I</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.089" end="00:59:35.980" style="s2">think we do that to to try to personify</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.549" end="00:59:38.769" style="s2">external to ourselves the badness that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.980" end="00:59:41.049" style="s2">resides within us there&#39;s a story in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.769" end="00:59:43.539" style="s2">Bible that and it always troubles me too</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.049" end="00:59:44.890" style="s2">and Jesus says at a certain point in</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.539" end="00:59:46.599" style="s2">time we&#39;ll say it&#39;s Judgment Day</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.890" end="00:59:47.859" style="s2">you&#39;re all gonna show up in front of me</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.599" end="00:59:49.119" style="s2">and the sheep are gonna go to the left</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.859" end="00:59:51.519" style="s2">and the goats are gonna go to the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.119" end="00:59:54.519" style="s2">sheep to heaven goats to hell is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.519" end="00:59:56.890" style="s2">clear implication right and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.519" end="00:59:58.839" style="s2">like oh my word so the story goes that</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.890" end="01:00:00.819" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of nuns who are at a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.839" end="01:00:03.160" style="s2">seminar with this priest and this</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.819" end="01:00:04.569" style="s2">passage is really worrying them because</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.160" end="01:00:06.279" style="s2">you know they&#39;re dedicating their lives</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.569" end="01:00:08.740" style="s2">to try to do everything right right and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.279" end="01:00:10.900" style="s2">but who&#39;s a sheep who&#39;s a goat and so</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.740" end="01:00:14.710" style="s2">the priest says okay everybody stand up</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.900" end="01:00:17.079" style="s2">they do and he says all right if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.710" end="01:00:20.109" style="s2">ever done anything kind for another</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.079" end="01:00:21.999" style="s2">human being go stand on the right well</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.109" end="01:00:25.089" style="s2">they&#39;re nuns they all go stand on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.999" end="01:00:27.369" style="s2">right and he&#39;s like okay how many of you</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.089" end="01:00:30.119" style="s2">have ever been thoughtless or unkind or</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.369" end="01:00:33.130" style="s2">cruel to another human being well</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.119" end="01:00:35.980" style="s2">they&#39;re nuns so they&#39;re honest so they</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.130" end="01:00:39.759" style="s2">all go stand on the left and he says now</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.980" end="01:00:45.160" style="s2">do you get it we are all of us all sheep</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.759" end="01:00:47.980" style="s2">and goats at the same time it changes</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.160" end="01:00:51.519" style="s2">everything if you understand that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.980" end="01:00:54.970" style="s2">winnowing is not Beth from Jim but what</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.519" end="01:00:56.859" style="s2">is within Beth from Beth the winnowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.970" end="01:00:59.519" style="s2">of if we want to be simplistic the bad</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.859" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">from the good the wheat from the chaff</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.519" end="01:01:03.569" style="s2">that which is of God which versus that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.980" style="s2">which is not of God</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.569" end="01:01:08.799" style="s2">because I carry both within me all the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.980" end="01:01:10.509" style="s2">time so is there a real Satan walking</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.799" end="01:01:13.960" style="s2">around with real demons tempting me</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.509" end="01:01:16.569" style="s2">maybe maybe you know I&#39;m not in charge</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.960" end="01:01:20.440" style="s2">of the universe and I don&#39;t know is it</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.569" end="01:01:23.740" style="s2">smart to act as if there is probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.440" end="01:01:25.329" style="s2">you know but but at the same time do I</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.740" end="01:01:30.069" style="s2">get to use that to get me off the hook</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.329" end="01:01:33.009" style="s2">not ever not ever and because God has</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.069" end="01:01:35.319" style="s2">predestined me to live within God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.009" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">grace I am thrilled to be able to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.319" end="01:01:40.029" style="s2">anything I can to live out God&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:42.579" style="s2">the best I can and ask God&#39;s forgiveness</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.029" end="01:01:45.519" style="s2">when I when I don&#39;t do it the best I can</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.579" end="01:01:47.410" style="s2">which is pretty much every day beyond</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.519" end="01:01:49.630" style="s2">kind of like that you know that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.410" end="01:01:51.880" style="s2">less horrifying than a lot of which gets</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.630" end="01:01:54.099" style="s2">passed off as Christianity with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.880" end="01:01:55.269" style="s2">Hellfire and brimstone well you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.099" end="01:01:56.890" style="s2">people have talked to me about that and</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.269" end="01:01:58.779" style="s2">I&#39;m like you know there might be hell I</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.890" end="01:02:00.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know I&#39;m telling you I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.779" end="01:02:03.009" style="s2">so but remember what we said earlier I</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.670" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">could be wrong here&#39;s the thing I do</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.009" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">know because I was in a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:09.609" style="s2">churches as a child I was raised by an</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:11.859" style="s2">atheist right so my faith journey is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.609" end="01:02:14.109" style="s2">from the opposite spectrum going toward</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.859" end="01:02:15.759" style="s2">faith rather than away but a whole lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.109" end="01:02:17.950" style="s2">of people talked to me for a whole long</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.759" end="01:02:21.759" style="s2">time you know about different faith</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.950" end="01:02:25.960" style="s2">issues and anybody who tried to scare me</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.759" end="01:02:27.519" style="s2">into Jesus it never worked now maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.960" end="01:02:30.069" style="s2">there are some people who need to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.519" end="01:02:31.750" style="s2">scared to Jesus I&#39;m not one of them the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.069" end="01:02:34.750" style="s2">more you try to scare me the more I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.750" end="01:02:37.480" style="s2">not interested because life&#39;s scary why</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.750" end="01:02:39.490" style="s2">do I want to sign on for more scary you</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.480" end="01:02:39.819" style="s2">know if I have a choice in or say in the</p>

<p begin="01:02:39.819" end="01:02:44.380" style="s2">so that just never made sense to me you</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.759" end="01:02:46.210" style="s2">know people have tried to threaten me</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.380" end="01:02:48.700" style="s2">into all kinds of behavior it never</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.210" end="01:02:50.289" style="s2">works as soon as you&#39;re threatening me</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.700" end="01:02:53.200" style="s2">I&#39;m digging in those West Virginia heels</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.289" end="01:02:55.660" style="s2">and saying uh make me maybe some people</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.200" end="01:02:58.809" style="s2">need to be scared to heaven with threats</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.660" end="01:03:00.789" style="s2">of hell I&#39;ve never met them yet that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.809" end="01:03:02.500" style="s2">very hopeful way to be if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.789" end="01:03:04.269" style="s2">be a Christian I like your form of</p>

<p begin="01:03:35.130" end="01:03:41.099" style="s2">yes I am a pacifist that&#39;s the short one</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.979" end="01:03:44.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a pacifist I think ever since</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.099" end="01:03:46.859" style="s2">I can remember so while it is an accord</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.190" end="01:03:48.779" style="s2">with my faith it&#39;s given birth before I</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.859" end="01:03:50.609" style="s2">knew about faith and it was probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.779" end="01:03:52.319" style="s2">because of the Vietnam War right we grew</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.609" end="01:03:53.849" style="s2">up with that you know with the evening</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.319" end="01:03:56.430" style="s2">news and the body bags and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.849" end="01:03:58.470" style="s2">and so that was pretty formative to me</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.430" end="01:04:00.690" style="s2">and the notion that we were lied into</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.470" end="01:04:03.150" style="s2">war became really evident in at a really</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.690" end="01:04:06.180" style="s2">young age and so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where a</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.150" end="01:04:08.099" style="s2">lot of that comes from for me so to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.180" end="01:04:09.900" style="s2">flash forward in time when I was in</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.099" end="01:04:12.630" style="s2">seminary I started seminary in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.900" end="01:04:15.089" style="s2">summer of 2001 and we were on a break</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.630" end="01:04:17.670" style="s2">between summer and fall semesters and on</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.089" end="01:04:19.799" style="s2">September 10th 2001 I went with a couple</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.670" end="01:04:20.579" style="s2">of friends to New York City we saw a</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.799" end="01:04:22.680" style="s2">Broadway play</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.579" end="01:04:24.930" style="s2">nobody ever reports this in the news but</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.680" end="01:04:27.390" style="s2">there was a deluge that was biblical we</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.930" end="01:04:28.680" style="s2">got so wet we literally had to run into</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.390" end="01:04:30.410" style="s2">a sporting goods store and buy new</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.680" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">clothes to wear to go to this play</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.410" end="01:04:34.859" style="s2">earlier in the day in the late afternoon</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:37.019" style="s2">we&#39;d gone up atop the World Trade Center</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.859" end="01:04:38.910" style="s2">towers and so we were some of the last</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.019" end="01:04:41.130" style="s2">people to do that go up and down and</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.910" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">come out alive on September 11th I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.130" end="01:04:45.329" style="s2">sitting at my desk doing some work I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:47.009" style="s2">sent my son an email saying I was kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.329" end="01:04:48.269" style="s2">of homesick and he called me and said</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.009" end="01:04:49.529" style="s2">are you all right I&#39;m like I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.269" end="01:04:52.140" style="s2">little homesick and he said turn on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.529" end="01:04:54.900" style="s2">TV and so of course then on September</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.140" end="01:04:57.180" style="s2">11th I saw what everybody saw and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.900" end="01:04:58.499" style="s2">remember my immediate response was we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.180" end="01:05:03.119" style="s2">gonna go kill a bunch of brown people</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.499" end="01:05:05.880" style="s2">and I was in conversation with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.119" end="01:05:07.589" style="s2">seminary friends and even in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.880" end="01:05:08.910" style="s2">seminary and I admit I was naive enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.589" end="01:05:10.859" style="s2">to think that people studying to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.910" end="01:05:12.089" style="s2">preachers would probably be more moral</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.859" end="01:05:14.759" style="s2">than the general public</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.089" end="01:05:16.380" style="s2">not true and so one fellow who was</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.759" end="01:05:19.380" style="s2">Egyptian had people telling him</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.380" end="01:05:21.630" style="s2">Christian telling him Muslim jokes one</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.380" end="01:05:23.849" style="s2">fellow who was from India had his car</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.630" end="01:05:26.309" style="s2">scratched and defaced with all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.849" end="01:05:27.809" style="s2">Muslim things a couple of guys wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.309" end="01:05:30.630" style="s2">serve you french fries and still you</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.809" end="01:05:35.219" style="s2">started calling them freedom fries small</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.630" end="01:05:38.219" style="s2">potatoes you know it but nasty in a Sikh</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.219" end="01:05:41.609" style="s2">Christian kind of a way but so this</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.219" end="01:05:43.469" style="s2">whole insanity that was happening where</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.609" end="01:05:45.809" style="s2">people where I was new people who had</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.469" end="01:05:48.329" style="s2">died right people were going and helping</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.809" end="01:05:48.970" style="s2">we were sending food and clothing and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.329" end="01:05:50.470" style="s2">volunteer</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.970" end="01:05:53.020" style="s2">course turned out they didn&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.470" end="01:05:55.000" style="s2">for blood and so just one step removed</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.020" end="01:05:57.099" style="s2">in Princeton New Jersey and realizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.000" end="01:05:59.740" style="s2">I&#39;d been in that building one day before</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.099" end="01:06:02.380" style="s2">or less than a day before made it very</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.740" end="01:06:04.570" style="s2">real so a group of us got together and</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.380" end="01:06:09.220" style="s2">formed Princeton seminarians for peace</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.570" end="01:06:11.349" style="s2">and in one of our meetings I said you</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.220" end="01:06:13.030" style="s2">know it because then very quickly of</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.349" end="01:06:16.030" style="s2">course attention from the country turned</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.030" end="01:06:18.760" style="s2">toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein and so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.030" end="01:06:20.230" style="s2">said to this group while we were at one</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.760" end="01:06:24.790" style="s2">of our meetings if we really believed</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.230" end="01:06:28.210" style="s2">this we&#39;d be there meaning in Iraq you</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.790" end="01:06:29.770" style="s2">know we would be the human shields and a</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.210" end="01:06:31.119" style="s2">friend of mine said it&#39;s funny you say</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.770" end="01:06:33.190" style="s2">that there&#39;s a group that&#39;s there right</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.119" end="01:06:37.060" style="s2">now one of my friends emails me every</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.190" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">day and so my friend gave me forwarded</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.060" end="01:06:42.550" style="s2">me Scott&#39;s emails from Iraq where</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:44.859" style="s2">Christian peacemaker teams was and with</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.550" end="01:06:47.890" style="s2">a presence on the eve of war there in</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.859" end="01:06:49.390" style="s2">2003 and I just kept following them and</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.890" end="01:06:51.310" style="s2">paying attention and learning more about</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.390" end="01:06:54.640" style="s2">them it was a group that was born out of</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.310" end="01:06:57.520" style="s2">the Mennonite tradition and in the 80s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.640" end="01:06:59.440" style="s2">Mennonite had given a speech because of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.520" end="01:07:02.770" style="s2">course Mennonites are pacifists in peace</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.440" end="01:07:04.810" style="s2">churches and he was challenging them to</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.770" end="01:07:06.520" style="s2">get away from the idea of letting the</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.810" end="01:07:08.920" style="s2">state protect you and just sitting back</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.520" end="01:07:11.050" style="s2">on your laurels and saying if we really</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.920" end="01:07:12.670" style="s2">are pacifists and believe in peace as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.050" end="01:07:15.940" style="s2">way of being we need to be where the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.670" end="01:07:17.560" style="s2">violence is and that spoke to mean like</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.940" end="01:07:19.540" style="s2">probably nothing I think I&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.560" end="01:07:22.270" style="s2">and so that was the foundation of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.540" end="01:07:24.310" style="s2">group and so they were in Israel</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.270" end="01:07:26.490" style="s2">Palestine and still are they were in</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.310" end="01:07:30.130" style="s2">Iraq and still are and some other places</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.490" end="01:07:32.800" style="s2">so I applied with them and went to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">Colombia South America for a two week</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.800" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">stint where they kind of watch you and</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:38.230" style="s2">evaluate whether they think you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">suitable and then I went through their</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.230" end="01:07:44.830" style="s2">month-long training in Chicago in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:47.500" style="s2">summer of 2005 and I went on my first</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.830" end="01:07:50.980" style="s2">trip to Baghdad the team was in Baghdad</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.500" end="01:07:52.570" style="s2">at the time living in what-what American</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.980" end="01:07:54.670" style="s2">soldiers called the red zone which meant</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.570" end="01:07:58.540" style="s2">everywhere in Iraq except the Green Zone</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.670" end="01:08:01.170" style="s2">and we went unarmed and we worked with</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.540" end="01:08:02.710" style="s2">Muslim Peace groups in Iraq and others</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.170" end="01:08:05.260" style="s2">Human Rights</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.710" end="01:08:06.790" style="s2">and so forth one of the things they did</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.260" end="01:08:08.800" style="s2">that I think&#39;s pretty amazing before I</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.790" end="01:08:11.640" style="s2">was ever there was if you&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.800" end="01:08:14.619" style="s2">seymour hersh wrote about Abu Ghraib and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.640" end="01:08:16.690" style="s2">what was going on there my group was</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.619" end="01:08:18.160" style="s2">pretty much the last western group to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.690" end="01:08:21.190" style="s2">there because of the kidnappings that</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.160" end="01:08:23.109" style="s2">started happening and we are a violence</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.190" end="01:08:25.029" style="s2">reduction group and usually we accompany</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.109" end="01:08:27.670" style="s2">people in violent places in in</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.029" end="01:08:28.989" style="s2">nonviolent ways so we&#39;re not a human</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.670" end="01:08:30.489" style="s2">rights group were not Amnesty</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.989" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">International so they didn&#39;t have any of</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.489" end="01:08:34.989" style="s2">those skill sets but they had</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:38.710" style="s2">accompanied folks looking for their boys</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.989" end="01:08:40.569" style="s2">because boys would disappear to be a boy</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.710" end="01:08:42.310" style="s2">in a Muslim country when the Americans</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.569" end="01:08:44.339" style="s2">are there is to be suspect of being a</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.310" end="01:08:46.509" style="s2">terrorist just to be young and male and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.339" end="01:08:48.670" style="s2">so whenever they&#39;d be out on the streets</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.509" end="01:08:50.200" style="s2">our soldiers would arrest him and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.670" end="01:08:52.630" style="s2">there were thousands and thousands being</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.200" end="01:08:54.130" style="s2">detained once they got out their</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.630" end="01:08:56.620" style="s2">families started bringing them to our</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.130" end="01:08:58.480" style="s2">folks simply because there was no one</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.620" end="01:08:59.739" style="s2">else to take them to and they started</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:02.500" style="s2">telling them their stories about what</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.739" end="01:09:05.049" style="s2">had happened to them so these young kids</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.500" end="01:09:06.460" style="s2">mostly on the team at that time just</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.049" end="01:09:09.279" style="s2">looked up on the internet about how to</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.460" end="01:09:11.739" style="s2">take a witness statement and started</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.279" end="01:09:14.859" style="s2">compiling all these testimonies and turn</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.739" end="01:09:16.810" style="s2">them over to Seymour Hersh and that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.859" end="01:09:19.029" style="s2">if not the beginning part of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.810" end="01:09:21.310" style="s2">beginning of the breaking of the Abu</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.029" end="01:09:24.609" style="s2">Ghraib story simply because they happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.310" end="01:09:27.670" style="s2">to be there so this group we would walk</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.609" end="01:09:29.140" style="s2">with people to like the school boy bus</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.670" end="01:09:32.710" style="s2">Patrol think about it that way but</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.140" end="01:09:35.529" style="s2">unarmed and so we would walk people to</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.710" end="01:09:37.569" style="s2">the Green Zone the irony for us was that</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.529" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">there was no danger to me to go into the</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.569" end="01:09:41.440" style="s2">Green Zone its American soldiers they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:43.540" style="s2">not gonna hurt me but it was very</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.440" end="01:09:47.230" style="s2">dangerous for the Iraqis to go there</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.540" end="01:09:49.120" style="s2">again male young right they&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.230" end="01:09:51.730" style="s2">disappeared into custody so we would</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.120" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">accompany them to try to seek redress or</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.730" end="01:09:57.400" style="s2">find help or find loved ones who&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:59.290" style="s2">misplaced lost or killed we accompanied</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.400" end="01:10:01.989" style="s2">Palestinian Iraqis who were trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.290" end="01:10:04.750" style="s2">leave the country we did a lot of more</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.989" end="01:10:06.400" style="s2">documentation work ultimately we had our</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.750" end="01:10:08.410" style="s2">own kidnapping and one of our colleagues</p>

<p begin="01:10:22.440" end="01:10:27.389" style="s2">safely work with us anymore because we</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.239" end="01:10:30.210" style="s2">were too high-profile so we went to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.389" end="01:10:32.880" style="s2">Kurdish north of Iraq and the team is</p>

<p begin="01:12:07.969" end="01:12:13.020" style="s2">because they say they&#39;re Kurds will run</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.260" end="01:12:15.570" style="s2">into Iraq and when that happens we pull</p>

<p begin="01:12:26.040" end="01:12:30.270" style="s2">understand it&#39;s been going on since you</p>

<p begin="01:12:30.270" end="01:12:34.560" style="s2">right so it&#39;s across Republican and</p>

<p begin="01:12:46.740" end="01:12:53.070" style="s2">shut and we don&#39;t care and bless the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.100" end="01:12:55.110" style="s2">Kurds art they keep believing hope</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.070" end="01:12:57.330" style="s2">against hope that if we the people only</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.110" end="01:13:00.450" style="s2">knew what our government was doing we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.330" end="01:13:02.790" style="s2">do something about it well we know the</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.450" end="01:13:04.650" style="s2">truth is we don&#39;t care because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.790" end="01:13:06.630" style="s2">have to because it&#39;s not in our backyard</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.650" end="01:13:09.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the best explanation I&#39;ve got for</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.630" end="01:13:12.780" style="s2">the indifference that that just murders</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.000" end="01:13:14.850" style="s2">people because it can so the work with</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.780" end="01:13:18.720" style="s2">peacemaking and in that part of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.850" end="01:13:21.720" style="s2">world is wonderful and wrenching and</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.720" end="01:13:24.150" style="s2">horrible and sometimes it can feel</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.720" end="01:13:26.460" style="s2">hopeless and yet the people themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.150" end="01:13:27.780" style="s2">who live there and do the work and can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.460" end="01:13:30.300" style="s2">get away because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.780" end="01:13:32.370" style="s2">passport like I do are some of the most</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.300" end="01:13:35.550" style="s2">hope filled human beings I&#39;ve ever met</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.370" end="01:13:38.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s been a real privilege so so</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.550" end="01:13:42.630" style="s2">peacemaking from my point of view is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.580" end="01:13:45.540" style="s2">calling I went to Iraq because God made</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.630" end="01:13:47.100" style="s2">me I didn&#39;t want to go and the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.540" end="01:13:49.110" style="s2">just would not leave me and would not</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.100" end="01:13:51.570" style="s2">leave me alone and I felt like I had to</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.110" end="01:13:53.220" style="s2">and I felt like I had to come home and</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.570" end="01:13:56.490" style="s2">tell and I spent a lot of time doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.220" end="01:13:59.820" style="s2">that it still feels like a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.490" end="01:14:01.800" style="s2">it but for me it felt like the that my</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.820" end="01:14:04.560" style="s2">calling was to be here among my own kind</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.800" end="01:14:07.530" style="s2">so to speak and to be speaking peace</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.560" end="01:14:09.210" style="s2">into these contexts because the change</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.530" end="01:14:12.510" style="s2">is going to happen in the world as it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.210" end="01:14:14.850" style="s2">today from places like this if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.510" end="01:14:16.470" style="s2">going to happen at all because we&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="01:14:27.420" end="01:14:31.050" style="s2">go visit these guys in the mountains</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.460" end="01:14:34.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re all together PKK and</p>

<p begin="01:14:57.750" end="01:15:01.230" style="s2">because pJAK is sharing them with them</p>

<p begin="01:17:06.929" end="01:17:11.429" style="s2">fun and the Arab kids said and I quote</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.699" end="01:17:13.110" style="s2">what is fun and then they said well do</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.429" end="01:17:17.400" style="s2">you have hobbies and they said what is a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.110" end="01:17:21.510" style="s2">hobby so it&#39;s not that you can&#39;t be a</p>

<p begin="01:17:26.309" end="01:17:31.050" style="s2">same for the adults at least the</p>

<p begin="01:17:33.659" end="01:17:39.539" style="s2">cost of the day-to-day grind of that and</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.360" end="01:17:42.409" style="s2">these people have been at war not</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.539" end="01:17:45.179" style="s2">largely of their own making for decades</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.409" end="01:17:46.800" style="s2">not always I wish all my American</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.179" end="01:17:48.119" style="s2">friends would stop saying we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.800" end="01:17:49.380" style="s2">anything the Middle East has been at war</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.119" end="01:17:52.139" style="s2">forever no it hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.380" end="01:17:54.059" style="s2">it actually was in a fairly solid state</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.139" end="01:17:56.249" style="s2">of peaceful coexistence for a very long</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.059" end="01:17:58.860" style="s2">time and then the West couldn&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.249" end="01:18:00.869" style="s2">their hands off of resources and went in</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.860" end="01:18:03.989" style="s2">and made countries and picked sides and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.869" end="01:18:07.260" style="s2">armed everybody on all sides and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.989" end="01:18:09.300" style="s2">logical consequences war so there we</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.260" end="01:18:11.999" style="s2">have it you&#39;ve also talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.300" end="01:18:14.010" style="s2">about the new modern ways of war were</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.999" end="01:18:17.130" style="s2">things like drones or people sitting in</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.010" end="01:18:19.369" style="s2">a trailer in Nevada and blow up a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.130" end="01:18:21.780" style="s2">of tents in Syria by remote control</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.369" end="01:18:23.579" style="s2">that&#39;s only going to get more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.780" end="01:18:25.469" style="s2">as we start even getting autonomous</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.579" end="01:18:27.780" style="s2">warfighting vehicles what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.469" end="01:18:31.110" style="s2">of the moral challenges of these new</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.780" end="01:18:32.849" style="s2">kinds of killing at a distance I would</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.110" end="01:18:34.739" style="s2">say that I think that all it does is</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.849" end="01:18:37.019" style="s2">delay the impact on the one doing the</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.739" end="01:18:39.059" style="s2">killing that is you may not feel the</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.019" end="01:18:41.570" style="s2">impact in the moment but you will feel</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.059" end="01:18:43.979" style="s2">the impact so if I understand correctly</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.570" end="01:18:45.809" style="s2">after world war two they did some</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.979" end="01:18:47.670" style="s2">studies and found out that this huge</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.809" end="01:18:49.920" style="s2">percentage over well over seventy five</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.670" end="01:18:52.019" style="s2">percent of soldiers in World War two</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.920" end="01:18:54.869" style="s2">that most just war in our history we</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.019" end="01:18:58.289" style="s2">know about did not fire their weapons at</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.869" end="01:19:00.780" style="s2">all or fired high well the military said</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.289" end="01:19:04.590" style="s2">quite rightly being an instrument of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.780" end="01:19:06.719" style="s2">killing in war this won&#39;t do and so as</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.590" end="01:19:08.639" style="s2">the story goes they were one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.719" end="01:19:10.920" style="s2">inventors if not the inventor of what we</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.639" end="01:19:13.350" style="s2">think of as the modern video game</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.920" end="01:19:16.200" style="s2">as a way by repetition and simulation to</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.350" end="01:19:18.180" style="s2">strain people to kill to overcome their</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.200" end="01:19:20.670" style="s2">resistance to the idea of killing and</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.180" end="01:19:22.260" style="s2">they got very successful at it the</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.670" end="01:19:26.430" style="s2">second thing I would point out is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.260" end="01:19:28.910" style="s2">in 1990 percent of the people who died</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.430" end="01:19:31.890" style="s2">in war were soldiers or combatants in</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.910" end="01:19:35.490" style="s2">2000 ninety percent of the people who</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.890" end="01:19:39.300" style="s2">died in war were civilians usually women</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.490" end="01:19:42.630" style="s2">and children modern technology has made</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.300" end="01:19:45.060" style="s2">it so that the soldier survives but</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.630" end="01:19:46.710" style="s2">without any worry or concern to what we</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.060" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">now call because we don&#39;t want to call</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.710" end="01:19:52.710" style="s2">them people collateral damage so we</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:55.530" style="s2">didn&#39;t reduce the numbers who died</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.710" end="01:19:57.840" style="s2">we simply shifted them and that was</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.530" end="01:19:59.460" style="s2">pretty intentional because of course you</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.840" end="01:20:02.640" style="s2">invest a lot of money time and effort in</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.460" end="01:20:03.900" style="s2">a soldier can&#39;t have them die even</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.640" end="01:20:09.390" style="s2">though they&#39;re the ones assuming the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.900" end="01:20:12.030" style="s2">risk so you have in modern warfare the</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.390" end="01:20:14.060" style="s2">general doesn&#39;t lead you know or the</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.030" end="01:20:18.470" style="s2">king or the president from the front</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.060" end="01:20:21.150" style="s2">they lead from the rear most soldiers</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.470" end="01:20:23.780" style="s2">including I would say generals actually</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.150" end="01:20:27.060" style="s2">don&#39;t like war and want to avoid it but</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.780" end="01:20:28.860" style="s2">civilian leadership in our model is more</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.060" end="01:20:32.760" style="s2">and more removed from the realities of</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.860" end="01:20:34.830" style="s2">it and so it&#39;s easy isn&#39;t it for my</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.760" end="01:20:36.510" style="s2">liberal friends Barack Obama is the one</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.830" end="01:20:40.440" style="s2">who started killing civilians with</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.510" end="01:20:42.900" style="s2">drones and using drone warfare to save</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.440" end="01:20:45.870" style="s2">the lives of soldiers at the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.900" end="01:20:48.030" style="s2">every civilian in the area always at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.870" end="01:20:51.330" style="s2">cost part is what we don&#39;t seem to want</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.030" end="01:20:54.750" style="s2">to ask ourselves so we have this this</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.330" end="01:20:57.660" style="s2">shift and then this notion that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.750" end="01:21:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t think about it when we went to war</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.660" end="01:21:03.030" style="s2">against Iraq I can remember remember how</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.240" end="01:21:04.920" style="s2">CNN with that first Gulf War became</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.030" end="01:21:07.410" style="s2">famous because they were showing the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.920" end="01:21:09.930" style="s2">green streaming lights of the the</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.410" end="01:21:11.850" style="s2">missiles anti-aircraft yeah and the</p>

<p begin="01:21:11.850" end="01:21:14.730" style="s2">shock at all I think they called it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.100" end="01:21:17.100" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.730" end="01:21:19.920" style="s2">flash-forward into the second Iraq war</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.100" end="01:21:22.680" style="s2">the one in the 2000s and before we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.920" end="01:21:24.740" style="s2">going some commentators on a naval ship</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.680" end="01:21:26.810" style="s2">with a young kid I bet he was 18</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.740" end="01:21:28.340" style="s2">you know who was showing her you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.810" end="01:21:30.050" style="s2">his console and how he would push a</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.340" end="01:21:31.870" style="s2">button and that would lead to a missile</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.050" end="01:21:35.650" style="s2">that would lead to you know an attack on</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.870" end="01:21:38.660" style="s2">her cook or Baghdad or Naja for wherever</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.650" end="01:21:40.340" style="s2">the interviewer asked him you know how</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.660" end="01:21:42.140" style="s2">he felt about the fact that he would hit</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.340" end="01:21:43.430" style="s2">a button and that would kill people and</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.140" end="01:21:45.920" style="s2">he said I&#39;m not killing people I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.430" end="01:21:48.140" style="s2">hitting a button and I never forgot that</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.920" end="01:21:50.990" style="s2">but then when I was talking to someone</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.140" end="01:21:53.630" style="s2">an old old old retired CIA soldier guy</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.990" end="01:21:56.000" style="s2">you know and I&#39;m like so are they really</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.630" end="01:21:57.710" style="s2">that detached from it and he said no he</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.000" end="01:22:01.040" style="s2">said all that means is you don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.710" end="01:22:02.570" style="s2">about it till you get home and so with</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.040" end="01:22:05.750" style="s2">the suicide rates we&#39;re seeing among</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.570" end="01:22:07.850" style="s2">veterans and the homelessness the</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.750" end="01:22:11.120" style="s2">homelessness can&#39;t just be about not</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.850" end="01:22:14.180" style="s2">having enough money and also I&#39;m suspect</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.120" end="01:22:15.490" style="s2">has to do with addiction issues and your</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.180" end="01:22:18.380" style="s2">life just falling apart</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.490" end="01:22:19.520" style="s2">we figured out really well how to train</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.380" end="01:22:21.860" style="s2">people how to kill</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.520" end="01:22:24.890" style="s2">we have never figured out how to help</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.860" end="01:22:27.560" style="s2">them live with it we&#39;ve trained people</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.890" end="01:22:30.380" style="s2">how to leave dead children on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.560" end="01:22:32.210" style="s2">battlefield at the time but we&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.380" end="01:22:36.710" style="s2">figured out how to help them live with</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.210" end="01:22:40.910" style="s2">it and the the sin and the blood and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.710" end="01:22:45.080" style="s2">guilt is ours collectively so every</p>

<p begin="01:25:56.430" end="01:26:01.770" style="s2">where you and I are good conversation</p>

<p begin="01:26:04.680" end="01:26:10.530" style="s2">paradigm seems to be that if we can do</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.530" end="01:26:13.050" style="s2">something we will do something without</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.530" end="01:26:15.540" style="s2">even stopping to take a breath really</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.050" end="01:26:18.870" style="s2">most of the time to ask ourselves should</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.540" end="01:26:20.280" style="s2">we do this can we forego something even</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.870" end="01:26:23.990" style="s2">though we can do it because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.280" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">good for us and I don&#39;t know how we</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.990" end="01:26:29.520" style="s2">encourage that kind of space</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:31.110" style="s2">to allow for that kind of time because</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.520" end="01:26:32.760" style="s2">the argument always seems to be well if</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.110" end="01:26:35.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t do it someone else will well</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.760" end="01:26:37.800" style="s2">maybe maybe not because there is a lot</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.880" end="01:26:40.230" style="s2">of collective group think and herd</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.800" end="01:26:42.120" style="s2">behavior in human beings right so I</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.230" end="01:26:44.430" style="s2">wonder if we can start thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.120" end="01:26:47.970" style="s2">ethical models where we give ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.430" end="01:26:51.090" style="s2">space for ethical reflection on what we</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.970" end="01:26:53.160" style="s2">should do versus what we can do it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.090" end="01:26:54.600" style="s2">good enough to say well the only people</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.160" end="01:26:56.580" style="s2">who don&#39;t use drones are the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.600" end="01:26:58.230" style="s2">don&#39;t have them wouldn&#39;t it be nice to</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.580" end="01:27:00.240" style="s2">be the people who don&#39;t use them because</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.230" end="01:27:02.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided you know these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.240" end="01:27:05.580" style="s2">these just aren&#39;t good and so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.520" end="01:27:07.890" style="s2">going to do it but how to create space</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.580" end="01:27:10.080" style="s2">to have those reflective conversations</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.890" end="01:27:13.080" style="s2">and and you know come to if not</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.080" end="01:27:14.670" style="s2">consensus at least common understanding</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.080" end="01:27:17.100" style="s2">or the ability to give ourselves time</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.670" end="01:27:20.040" style="s2">that&#39;s the second piece of it is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.100" end="01:27:21.870" style="s2">experience of time because change and</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.040" end="01:27:25.130" style="s2">innovations seem to be happening so much</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.870" end="01:27:28.200" style="s2">more quickly our experience of time</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.130" end="01:27:31.350" style="s2">compresses so that it feels as if we</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.200" end="01:27:34.020" style="s2">have to do everything now so literally I</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.350" end="01:27:35.820" style="s2">I Drive everybody in my social circle in</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.020" end="01:27:38.400" style="s2">my family circle crazy because I do not</p>

<p begin="01:27:38.400" end="01:27:42.780" style="s2">before but as you know I live in an area</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.800" end="01:27:45.020" style="s2">that without a fair amount of effort and</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.780" end="01:27:47.610" style="s2">quite a bit of cash I might point out I</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.020" end="01:27:49.830" style="s2">can&#39;t have one easily and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.610" end="01:27:51.720" style="s2">really usable all that much to me here</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.830" end="01:27:54.810" style="s2">nor necessary I&#39;ve got a landline then</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.720" end="01:27:57.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a computer so what but the fact</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.810" end="01:27:59.810" style="s2">that I am not available for instant</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.000" end="01:28:02.250" style="s2">communication really bothers some people</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.810" end="01:28:03.930" style="s2">but then I laugh and I say well if I</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.250" end="01:28:06.240" style="s2">call you you don&#39;t answer you screen</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.930" end="01:28:08.010" style="s2">calls so you don&#39;t get instant</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.240" end="01:28:11.070" style="s2">communication anyway you get the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.010" end="01:28:14.010" style="s2">of instant communication but this this</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.070" end="01:28:16.170" style="s2">notion of time speeding up when time</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.010" end="01:28:17.970" style="s2">hasn&#39;t really changed to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.170" end="01:28:20.580" style="s2">times the thing at all as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.970" end="01:28:22.980" style="s2">construct but our experience of it has</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.580" end="01:28:25.740" style="s2">radically changed so how do we give</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.980" end="01:28:27.690" style="s2">ourselves permission to slow down when</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.740" end="01:28:29.610" style="s2">everything about us and everything about</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.690" end="01:28:32.310" style="s2">our world seems to be insisting that we</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.610" end="01:28:34.350" style="s2">speed up the third thing I guess is</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.310" end="01:28:37.020" style="s2">thoughtfulness and mindfulness I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.350" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">never forget back in the 90s</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.020" end="01:28:40.660" style="s2">Ross Perot wasn&#39;t he running as an</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.880" end="01:28:42.850" style="s2">independent for president yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.660" end="01:28:44.560" style="s2">and he was talking about the economy and</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.850" end="01:28:46.870" style="s2">I forget what his plans were but he had</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.560" end="01:28:48.610" style="s2">some plans for an economy in trouble but</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.870" end="01:28:50.200" style="s2">then he said something I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.610" end="01:28:52.090" style="s2">forgotten he said you know what the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.200" end="01:28:55.690" style="s2">truth is we don&#39;t have to do anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.090" end="01:28:59.200" style="s2">about this it&#39;ll fix itself even if we</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.690" end="01:29:03.190" style="s2">do nothing we won&#39;t like it but it will</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.200" end="01:29:05.170" style="s2">fix itself and so mindfulness ever since</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.190" end="01:29:07.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard that has reminded me that a</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.170" end="01:29:10.780" style="s2">lot of systems within the earth if not</p>

<p begin="01:29:10.780" end="01:29:15.880" style="s2">usually pretty violent in the process so</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.380" end="01:29:18.280" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t have to do a thing about</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.880" end="01:29:19.540" style="s2">climate change I&#39;m pretty sure old</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.280" end="01:29:21.610" style="s2">mother earth will take care of it</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.540" end="01:29:24.430" style="s2">whether we do or not but it won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.610" end="01:29:27.550" style="s2">good for human beings when she does but</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.430" end="01:29:29.590" style="s2">how do we be mindful to have a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.550" end="01:29:32.290" style="s2">way of thinking you know the Asian</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.590" end="01:29:35.650" style="s2">culture very much has built into it a</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.290" end="01:29:38.410" style="s2">long-term way of thinking our culture</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.650" end="01:29:40.330" style="s2">doesn&#39;t we are very short-term thinkers</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.410" end="01:29:42.910" style="s2">and there are things to recommend both I</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.330" end="01:29:44.620" style="s2">think you need both and so that I guess</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.910" end="01:29:46.690" style="s2">is the other piece is how we move from</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.620" end="01:29:49.150" style="s2">competition to cooperation and</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.690" end="01:29:51.190" style="s2">understanding that I don&#39;t have to see</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.150" end="01:29:53.710" style="s2">the other as a threat to my existence</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.190" end="01:29:55.390" style="s2">that you actually bring something to the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.710" end="01:29:58.120" style="s2">table that I need that without you I</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.390" end="01:29:59.410" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have and I think that&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.120" end="01:30:02.560" style="s2">every political debate we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.410" end="01:30:05.200" style="s2">right now and in every cultural debate</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.560" end="01:30:07.810" style="s2">we&#39;re having it&#39;s not my way or your way</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.200" end="01:30:09.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it really does need to be our way</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.810" end="01:30:11.530" style="s2">and I&#39;m not talking about compromise I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.640" end="01:30:13.480" style="s2">just talking about this goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.530" end="01:30:15.250" style="s2">that notion of communion that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.480" end="01:30:18.130" style="s2">not at the table I don&#39;t have Jim&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:30:18.130" end="01:30:23.710" style="s2">that Beth doesn&#39;t have and why did was I</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.640" end="01:30:26.050" style="s2">allowed to forget that and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.710" end="01:30:28.570" style="s2">reclaim that so I know the questions to</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.050" end="01:30:31.540" style="s2">ask I&#39;m not sure how to get to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.570" end="01:30:34.200" style="s2">answers I think the questions is a good</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.540" end="01:30:37.060" style="s2">place to start and it is a difficult</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.200" end="01:30:39.790" style="s2">difficult problem because we have been</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.060" end="01:30:42.340" style="s2">locked in a game theory competition as</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.790" end="01:30:44.170" style="s2">you said well if I don&#39;t do it the other</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.340" end="01:30:46.690" style="s2">guy will write and then I&#39;ll be left</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.170" end="01:30:48.610" style="s2">behind and our capitalist economy</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.690" end="01:30:50.920" style="s2">reinforces that in spades you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.610" end="01:30:53.260" style="s2">companies live or die by small margins</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.920" end="01:30:54.610" style="s2">if I can produce you know a smart phone</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.260" end="01:30:56.290" style="s2">for $20</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.610" end="01:30:58.659" style="s2">less than you can you&#39;re gonna go out of</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.290" end="01:31:00.550" style="s2">business so you have to use child labor</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.659" end="01:31:02.590" style="s2">too or you&#39;ll you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.550" end="01:31:04.719" style="s2">compete so we have some horrible</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.590" end="01:31:06.850" style="s2">dynamics built into our system so I</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.719" end="01:31:08.110" style="s2">suspect to answer those questions and I</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.850" end="01:31:10.119" style="s2">think you did a wonderful job of</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.110" end="01:31:12.060" style="s2">summarizing the questions we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.119" end="01:31:14.340" style="s2">may have to make some very serious</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.060" end="01:31:16.540" style="s2">changes in how we organize our society</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.340" end="01:31:17.830" style="s2">exactly what they are as you say are a</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.540" end="01:31:20.260" style="s2">little unknown but we have some</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.830" end="01:31:22.119" style="s2">challenges ahead of us all and I think</p>
