<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:08.970" style="s2">hey folks right here let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.090" end="00:00:11.280" style="s2">the evolutionary purpose of life this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.970" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">actually a fairly easy question though</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.280" end="00:00:15.150" style="s2">the answer has very disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">implications behind me you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.150" end="00:00:18.869" style="s2">foxglove which is an invasive species</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:21.420" style="s2">here in the Pacific Northwest</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.869" end="00:00:23.369" style="s2">it&#39;s digitalis which is the source of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:25.740" style="s2">very important cardiac drug you probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.369" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">also see some bees that are pollinating</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.740" end="00:00:29.250" style="s2">it and no doubt you&#39;ll see some</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">mosquitoes flying around me truth is</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.250" end="00:00:34.079" style="s2">that all of these creatures and human</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">beings have the same purpose because</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">evolutionarily there can be only one the</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">purpose of living creatures is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">advance the spelling&#39;s that they find</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">within their genomes into the future now</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">we could say it&#39;s that produce as many</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:49.200" style="s2">copies as possible in the next</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">generation that&#39;s not quite right though</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.200" end="00:00:55.199" style="s2">it works as a proxy for most things but</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">we can say that genomes are agreements</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.199" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">between genes of different loci to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">advance the interests of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:04.170" style="s2">spellings found there to the exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:06.420" style="s2">of alternative spellings that might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.170" end="00:01:09.119" style="s2">found in other members of the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.420" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">species and what does it mean that</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.119" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">mosquitoes and bees and plants and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">humans all share this purpose it means</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.830" style="s2">that the purpose isn&#39;t very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:22.229" style="s2">it&#39;s generic what is interesting is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.830" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">different evolutionary machinery that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.229" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">have all inherited with which to advance</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:29.240" style="s2">our spellings now my argument would be</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:32.369" style="s2">there is actually one possible exception</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.240" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">one way in which a creature can have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.369" end="00:01:37.259" style="s2">different purpose but it requires us to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:39.150" style="s2">assign that new purpose to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.259" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">step away from the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.150" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">imperative that has guided us for three</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:45.390" style="s2">and a half billion years yes three and a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:47.399" style="s2">half billion years is a good number</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.390" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">it may not be precise but that is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.399" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">period of time in which the tree of life</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:54.630" style="s2">has existed on earth and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">you as a member of human species at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.630" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">tip of the human branch have an unbroken</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">line of successful reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:03.149" style="s2">stretching back all the way the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:05.159" style="s2">living creature that&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.149" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">winning streak it is almost certain to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.159" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">come to an end for you and me and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">other creatures you see in this frame</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">within the next few generations most</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">creatures do not make it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.730" style="s2">and this bottlenecking effect this</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">limiting of those creatures who succeed</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.730" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">in reproducing within any cohort to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">very small fraction of the total number</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:25.800" style="s2">of creatures attempting to do so it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:29.070" style="s2">that bottlenecking</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.800" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">that makes adaptive evolution happen it</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.070" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">reduces the total evolutionary output to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:38.520" style="s2">only that small fraction that is very</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:41.310" style="s2">well suited and also very lucky and able</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.520" end="00:02:42.960" style="s2">to continue one more generation into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.310" end="00:02:45.300" style="s2">future I hope this has been enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.960" end="00:02:47.100" style="s2">and I look forward to talking more about</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.300" end="00:02:49.780" style="s2">the implications of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:58.469" style="s2">purpose of life in a future video</p>
