<p begin="00:00:29.119" end="00:00:35.150" style="s2">and maybe inducing some existential</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.150" end="00:00:40.699" style="s2">themes and you can think of it as a</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:01:00.559" style="s2">and he&#39;s got quite a treat in store for</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.559" end="00:01:08.630" style="s2">a talk and so gather some questions as</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.439" end="00:01:10.640" style="s2">as packages talk and then there&#39;ll be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.630" end="00:01:13.990" style="s2">second part where we get to ask those</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.640" end="00:01:17.869" style="s2">questions to Pat so without further ado</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.990" end="00:01:19.640" style="s2">I&#39;ll hand it over to you pat thank you</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.220" end="00:01:25.880" style="s2">off by the CRISPR talk and you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:28.430" style="s2">it for a round three which is excellent</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.880" end="00:01:32.180" style="s2">there was a great comment made about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.430" end="00:01:33.950" style="s2">CRISPR talk for use for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.180" end="00:01:36.590" style="s2">don&#39;t know it was the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.950" end="00:01:40.300" style="s2">applying hyper consumer behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.590" end="00:01:43.159" style="s2">marketing to CRISPR resulting in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.300" end="00:01:46.490" style="s2">Tower of Babel moment for our brains and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.159" end="00:01:48.500" style="s2">it&#39;s just all gonna go bad one person</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.490" end="00:01:51.050" style="s2">saw the existential horror immediately</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.500" end="00:01:54.860" style="s2">and asked well can we can we reverse</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.050" end="00:01:57.080" style="s2">entropy and I was I was one I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.860" end="00:02:00.830" style="s2">floored by the ability to grasp the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.080" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">essence of the problem so quickly and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.830" end="00:02:04.700" style="s2">said well yet you have to be able time</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:08.899" style="s2">reversal you have to deal time symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.700" end="00:02:11.330" style="s2">and the vote the collective vote was</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.899" end="00:02:13.819" style="s2">that we should probably discuss what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.330" end="00:02:16.730" style="s2">two of us are talking about in full and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.819" end="00:02:20.330" style="s2">so what this particular episode is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.730" end="00:02:22.670" style="s2">designed to not get rid of the hope that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.330" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">time is reversible but actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.670" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">introduced the hope that we may have</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:30.550" style="s2">gotten our math wrong the entire time</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.610" end="00:02:31.870" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to preface this because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.550" end="00:02:34.030" style="s2">know that there are some in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.870" end="00:02:35.490" style="s2">who I am about to step in their domain</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.030" end="00:02:39.070" style="s2">and all over it</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.490" end="00:02:40.810" style="s2">and about as reckless of a manner as I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.070" end="00:02:42.910" style="s2">can without the proper formalism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.810" end="00:02:46.210" style="s2">without the proper rigor letting you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.910" end="00:02:49.930" style="s2">know I&#39;m that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.210" end="00:02:53.050" style="s2">gonna ask you to give me a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.930" end="00:02:54.790" style="s2">patience as I do this because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.050" end="00:02:56.590" style="s2">trying to go to the rigor I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.790" end="00:02:58.300" style="s2">trying to introduce a concept than so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.590" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna skip some dependencies for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.300" end="00:03:03.610" style="s2">sake of time like I&#39;m gonna go into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">Riemann hypothesis for example and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.610" end="00:03:07.420" style="s2">know damn well like you can&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:10.030" style="s2">Riemann hypothesis about like three</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.420" end="00:03:11.860" style="s2">years of freaking linear calculus linear</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.030" end="00:03:13.330" style="s2">algebra beforehand and I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.860" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">dedicate a whole episode to that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.330" end="00:03:16.660" style="s2">plenty of great YouTube resources for</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:19.000" style="s2">that kind of thing so I&#39;m gonna skip</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.660" end="00:03:21.580" style="s2">through these concepts to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.000" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">primary concepts so I beg your</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.580" end="00:03:28.330" style="s2">forgiveness as I as I mangle your craft</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:31.080" style="s2">but there&#39;s a this would be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.330" end="00:03:33.910" style="s2">I&#39;m sure and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.080" end="00:03:35.769" style="s2">flaw that I&#39;ve detected and I&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.910" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">if it&#39;s valid on that so without any</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.769" end="00:03:52.950" style="s2">much more preparation here we go okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:59.290" style="s2">all right so entropy remains undefeated</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.160" end="00:04:02.110" style="s2">you can&#39;t win you can&#39;t break even you</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.290" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">can&#39;t even quit the game that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.110" end="00:04:08.680" style="s2">entropy folks and it&#39;s sponsored by a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:10.930" style="s2">little BP and this company that I found</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.680" end="00:04:13.060" style="s2">that somehow found what I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.930" end="00:04:14.980" style="s2">interesting I can hide behind quantum</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.060" end="00:04:16.359" style="s2">computers it can&#39;t be quantum leap Oken</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.980" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">so if you&#39;re interested go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.359" end="00:04:31.030" style="s2">click on that and have fun okay so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:33.460" style="s2">gonna get started with I&#39;m gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.030" end="00:04:36.190" style="s2">as much to the beginning as I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.460" end="00:04:37.660" style="s2">without going full ancient Greece so</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.190" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">once upon a time there&#39;s this guy named</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.660" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">Rudolph second here&#39;s the Holy Roman</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">Emperor the sixth</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:46.660" style="s2">hundreds you thought that sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:49.180" style="s2">thought that Catholics and Protestants</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.660" end="00:04:51.070" style="s2">were pretty cooled and the Jews are okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.180" end="00:04:53.290" style="s2">but boy that occultism was something</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.070" end="00:04:56.530" style="s2">else so this guy named Michael Mayer was</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.290" end="00:04:58.210" style="s2">the court Alchemist for Rudolf and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.530" end="00:05:02.470" style="s2">wrote a whole bunch of stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.210" end="00:05:07.240" style="s2">influential in terms of what we would</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.470" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">consider Gnosticism and occult magic of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.240" end="00:05:12.460" style="s2">the 1600s specifically that time period</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:14.260" style="s2">which is unique to that time period and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.460" end="00:05:16.180" style="s2">they got along pretty well and he did</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.260" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">all kinds of stuff including looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.180" end="00:05:21.580" style="s2">like the guy who made John McAfee which</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.980" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">is an interesting feature but he also</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.580" end="00:05:24.940" style="s2">wrote this thing called the fraternity</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:27.550" style="s2">of the roads across roads across as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.940" end="00:05:30.640" style="s2">know is a is a conspiracy oriented</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.550" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">secret society kind of thing but it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.640" end="00:05:35.590" style="s2">derivative of the time though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:37.750" style="s2">1600s it was about a hundred years into</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.590" end="00:05:39.490" style="s2">the printing press and what the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.750" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">is doing to us now the printing press</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.490" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">was doing to people that so anybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:45.490" style="s2">could write books you can introduce</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:47.230" style="s2">yourself to all these ideas you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.490" end="00:05:49.810" style="s2">these like little information cults all</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.230" end="00:05:51.310" style="s2">over the place and and people kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.810" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">fragment their information landscape</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.310" end="00:05:54.520" style="s2">aggressively so the internet is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.990" end="00:05:56.530" style="s2">second time we&#39;re doing this in books</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.520" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">with the very first time and these</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.530" end="00:06:01.420" style="s2">characters were a part of that face and</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:02.740" style="s2">driving it&#39;s very good this guy in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.420" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">particular was driving a good chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.740" end="00:06:09.760" style="s2">it he found the whole thing fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:13.240" style="s2">so Mathias comes along he says yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.760" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">Rudolf is kind of a dick I kind of want</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.240" end="00:06:16.210" style="s2">to get rid of him</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.990" end="00:06:18.340" style="s2">so he gets rid of him that&#39;s it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.210" end="00:06:20.590" style="s2">because he knocked off his his patron</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.340" end="00:06:22.660" style="s2">Michael Meyer decides to run screaming</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.590" end="00:06:24.040" style="s2">and says well I&#39;m done with this part</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.660" end="00:06:26.770" style="s2">I&#39;m going to now travel the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.040" end="00:06:32.260" style="s2">Europe and teach when I know about</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.770" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">things of course when one good knock one</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.260" end="00:06:37.030" style="s2">one good knockdown King appears another</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:38.410" style="s2">one appears as well ferdinand ii decided</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.030" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">to come along and says hey yeah I like</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.410" end="00:06:40.690" style="s2">that throwing B shame if something</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:42.670" style="s2">happened to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.690" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">Malthus was basically saying I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.670" end="00:06:46.180" style="s2">gonna repeat whatever this Cardinal says</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:47.980" style="s2">that was the wrong answer the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.180" end="00:06:50.230" style="s2">answer was Protestants in case you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.980" end="00:06:52.480" style="s2">were wondering he decided to go on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.230" end="00:06:54.230" style="s2">rampage and wipe out all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.480" end="00:06:56.990" style="s2">Protestants which unlock the</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.790" end="00:08:14.780" style="s2">there was actually a pretty serious</p>

<p begin="00:08:14.780" end="00:08:19.130" style="s2">Newton was definitely one of them okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.630" end="00:08:20.840" style="s2">any he&#39;s the inventor of calculus by the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.130" end="00:08:23.630" style="s2">way and these two things are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.840" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">related as we&#39;ll get it so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.630" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">how calculus is born we&#39;re wondering so</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:31.130" style="s2">that&#39;s an important part because</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:33.320" style="s2">calculus introduces a concept that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.130" end="00:08:35.660" style="s2">don&#39;t really deal with anymore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.320" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">called the infinitesimal I&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.660" end="00:08:46.790" style="s2">what that is as soon as my so start with</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:50.390" style="s2">differential calculus so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.790" end="00:08:52.220" style="s2">actual quote from I believe this is from</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.390" end="00:08:55.340" style="s2">Newton&#39;s waist book where he&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.220" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">down his ideas as he&#39;s coming along and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.340" end="00:09:01.520" style="s2">he says what is x and y in one moment</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:03.860" style="s2">will be X plus infant essa Mille and y</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.520" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">plus infinitesimal in the next when he</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.860" end="00:09:07.450" style="s2">was describing as the ratio of the</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.450" end="00:09:14.320" style="s2">this infinitesimal baton this is a hack</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.510" end="00:09:17.500" style="s2">this is consider well hold on this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.320" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">widely considered a hack and it turns</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.500" end="00:09:22.750" style="s2">out that Leibnitz relied on</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.750" end="00:09:24.280" style="s2">infinitesimals to a degree as well when</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.750" end="00:09:26.490" style="s2">he was going instead of trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.280" end="00:09:29.830" style="s2">out motion he was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.490" end="00:09:31.690" style="s2">the area of curves and he also relied on</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.830" end="00:09:33.700" style="s2">infant Testaments so they both came to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.690" end="00:09:35.080" style="s2">the same conclusion about this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.700" end="00:09:37.450" style="s2">everybody saw the infant testimonals</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.080" end="00:09:39.340" style="s2">like this is what the is this thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.450" end="00:09:42.520" style="s2">what do you mean an infant Testament so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.340" end="00:09:48.040" style="s2">an infinitesimally close to zero without</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.520" end="00:09:49.390" style="s2">being 0 so like zero point repeating all</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.040" end="00:09:51.520" style="s2">the way down to like 1 right so like</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.390" end="00:09:53.110" style="s2">nine billion zeros to the right and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.520" end="00:09:55.780" style="s2">like a one at the end of it so that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.110" end="00:09:58.510" style="s2">that&#39;s an infinitesimal it is so tiny it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.780" end="00:10:01.690" style="s2">almost doesn&#39;t matter and this was</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.510" end="00:10:04.210" style="s2">bolted on because of the because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.690" end="00:10:05.800" style="s2">dealing with ratios so by default you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.210" end="00:10:09.070" style="s2">dealing with division what happens if</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.800" end="00:10:10.780" style="s2">you divide by zero uh-oh well the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.070" end="00:10:13.390" style="s2">out of that problem is this both the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.780" end="00:10:16.090" style="s2">fake-ass number on to it son uh you got</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.390" end="00:10:20.190" style="s2">around the problem so that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.090" end="00:10:22.870" style="s2">what happened and he was doing this to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.190" end="00:10:25.810" style="s2">describe the tangent as it rides through</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.870" end="00:10:27.310" style="s2">different curvatures of motion and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.810" end="00:10:28.420" style="s2">reason why he was focusing on tangents</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.310" end="00:10:30.190" style="s2">was because they had to use these</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.420" end="00:10:31.750" style="s2">mathematical constructs to represent</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.190" end="00:10:34.750" style="s2">motion it&#39;s not like they had cameras</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.750" end="00:10:36.400" style="s2">and like lures and like I&#39;m going to sit</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.750" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">there and measure everything as I drop</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.400" end="00:10:40.030" style="s2">of all they couldn&#39;t do that so they had</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.010" style="s2">to use the limited mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.030" end="00:10:44.770" style="s2">constructs they had at the time to</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.010" end="00:10:45.640" style="s2">represent motion in a in a in a semi</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.770" end="00:10:48.700" style="s2">predictable manner</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:50.920" style="s2">and so they would utilize tangents</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.700" end="00:10:53.560" style="s2">because that&#39;s the limit of their math</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.920" end="00:10:54.790" style="s2">basically a lot of them to do so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.560" end="00:10:56.530" style="s2">you&#39;re wondering why all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.790" end="00:10:57.790" style="s2">feels alien and doesn&#39;t make sense in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.530" end="00:10:59.770" style="s2">the era of the computer just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.790" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">roll back to the 1600s and pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.770" end="00:11:04.570" style="s2">the only way to explore math math was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:06.370" style="s2">like by five different shapes and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.570" end="00:11:08.140" style="s2">all they had so it makes a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.370" end="00:11:13.000" style="s2">sense when you kind of looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.140" end="00:11:14.170" style="s2">way so again as I described if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.000" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with ratios and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.170" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">hitting zero then you have some serious</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.820" end="00:11:20.850" style="s2">problems but this is the very nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:24.629" style="s2">the infinitesimal introduces to prob</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.850" end="00:11:26.790" style="s2">one you know you can&#39;t divide by zero so</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.629" end="00:11:28.709" style="s2">you need the infinitesimal but because</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.790" end="00:11:29.309" style="s2">the infant s Amell is not zero you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.709" end="00:11:31.290" style="s2">ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.309" end="00:11:33.149" style="s2">the whole way this equation happened was</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.290" end="00:11:34.920" style="s2">you would do go through the equation</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.149" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">build ratios and the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.920" end="00:11:38.189" style="s2">structured was at the end you would then</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:40.499" style="s2">shrink the infinitesimal and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.189" end="00:11:41.699" style="s2">eliminated from the result so you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.499" end="00:11:47.009" style="s2">the actual number that you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.699" end="00:11:49.139" style="s2">for but this again that seems like such</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.009" end="00:11:51.420" style="s2">a hack this is like what this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.139" end="00:11:56.759" style="s2">this come on man you take me for a ride</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.420" end="00:11:57.989" style="s2">here right so that was not enough that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.759" end="00:12:01.649" style="s2">was this first pass that that just</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.989" end="00:12:05.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it so he was forced to describe</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.649" end="00:12:06.540" style="s2">what he called was deflection his way of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.100" end="00:12:13.589" style="s2">trying to make sense of time varying</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.540" end="00:12:15.059" style="s2">quantities and it didn&#39;t work so yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.589" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">everyone&#39;s favorite degenerate gambler</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.059" end="00:12:19.709" style="s2">helped but even with that help it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:22.259" style="s2">work very well in fact this is another</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.709" end="00:12:24.179" style="s2">actual quotes Newton where he cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.259" end="00:12:26.339" style="s2">proceed with the explanations of luxans</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.179" end="00:12:29.100" style="s2">now I have preferred to conceal it busts</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.339" end="00:12:32.610" style="s2"> gibberish like a caesarian</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:34.559" style="s2">cipher actual quote right so not even he</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.610" end="00:12:36.660" style="s2">had like a firm grasp on it cuz the info</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.559" end="00:12:38.819" style="s2">testimo problem was was bothering him</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.660" end="00:12:40.169" style="s2">too and he had to be like obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.819" end="00:12:42.809" style="s2">wasn&#39;t honest about he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.169" end="00:12:45.959" style="s2">hide the fact that he just know and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.809" end="00:12:47.220" style="s2">that&#39;s an emissive to the Leibnitz so</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.959" end="00:12:48.899" style="s2">they&#39;re both just like trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.220" end="00:12:50.129" style="s2">this into testicles were problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.899" end="00:12:53.610" style="s2">basically it&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to convey</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.129" end="00:12:55.499" style="s2">to you right and we know what it is from</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.610" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">a quality from a quantitative standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.499" end="00:12:58.649" style="s2">we know that it&#39;s infinitely close to</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:12:59.939" style="s2">zero without being zero but what does</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.649" end="00:13:02.399" style="s2">that actually mean what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.939" end="00:13:05.100" style="s2">like well there&#39;s one critique to Newton</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.399" end="00:13:07.889" style="s2">at the time that was actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.100" end="00:13:09.989" style="s2">damn good and the more I look at it the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.889" end="00:13:13.769" style="s2">more on point I realize it is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.989" end="00:13:16.110" style="s2">think the guy actually intended this his</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.769" end="00:13:17.970" style="s2">name was Brian George Burkley and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.110" end="00:13:21.299" style="s2">basically described in fantasmas as</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.970" end="00:13:24.350" style="s2">ghosts of departed quantities now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.299" end="00:13:27.480" style="s2">sounds like some pretty good pros and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.350" end="00:13:32.279" style="s2">the more I think about that phrase the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.480" end="00:13:33.710" style="s2">more I see why Newton had such a hard</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.279" end="00:13:35.330" style="s2">time with infant testicles</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.710" end="00:13:37.520" style="s2">and I&#39;ll be able to explain that in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.330" end="00:13:40.280" style="s2">later slide and and what he was trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.520" end="00:13:43.610" style="s2">to say is he was saying that the church</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.280" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">is one thing logic and reason is another</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.610" end="00:13:48.470" style="s2">so if you&#39;re gonna bolt infant s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:51.020" style="s2">emelle&#39;s on to your supposedly rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.470" end="00:13:52.550" style="s2">logical mathematics then you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.020" end="00:13:55.220" style="s2">bolt them on and we just take them by</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.550" end="00:13:58.010" style="s2">faith yeah otherwise it&#39;s no different</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.220" end="00:14:00.710" style="s2">than Church is just spinning up miracles</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.010" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">to keep consistency in their stories so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.710" end="00:14:04.610" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is this infant</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">testimo is equivalent to a miracle and</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.610" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">thus it&#39;s equivalent to a ghost and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2">therefore we should just get rid</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">of all and that was the critique that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:12.500" style="s2">actually launched this and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:16.040" style="s2">everything else and this kerchief would</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.500" end="00:14:18.050" style="s2">last it would stick for centuries but</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.040" end="00:14:21.230" style="s2">there&#39;s something else in here that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.050" end="00:14:23.390" style="s2">phrase the ghosts part is the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.230" end="00:14:26.900" style="s2">interesting part of that phrase so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.390" end="00:14:29.240" style="s2">gonna iterate toward that infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.900" end="00:14:30.830" style="s2">x&#39; as you can imagine not only pissed</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.240" end="00:14:33.470" style="s2">off the church but also pissed off the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.830" end="00:14:35.270" style="s2">internet you can see you may have</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.470" end="00:14:36.590" style="s2">noticed this meme at some point a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.270" end="00:14:38.780" style="s2">of years back where a point nine nine</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.590" end="00:14:41.000" style="s2">nine nine which is an inverse of n to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.780" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">test of all equals one you might have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.000" end="00:14:44.870" style="s2">memory of that sort of trick so these</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.280" style="s2">things are just like problems across the</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.870" end="00:14:47.660" style="s2">board these infinitesimally you bring</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.280" end="00:14:51.230" style="s2">them into something and it just causes a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.660" end="00:14:54.770" style="s2">mess everywhere they&#39;re also like I said</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.230" end="00:14:57.050" style="s2">there are also holy wars so there were</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.770" end="00:14:58.910" style="s2">so much so that there are some clerks in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.050" end="00:15:00.620" style="s2">Rome that just straight bandim you</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.910" end="00:15:02.510" style="s2">couldn&#39;t use them like just get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.620" end="00:15:07.340" style="s2">them you they caused too many</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.510" end="00:15:09.860" style="s2">arguments then you have again Bishop</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.340" end="00:15:12.020" style="s2">Berkeley was the one who launched his</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.860" end="00:15:14.330" style="s2">very good attack in his work called the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.020" end="00:15:16.600" style="s2">analysis and then you have the Lords of</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.330" end="00:15:19.190" style="s2">autism canter in particular it was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.600" end="00:15:22.700" style="s2">walking human-computer there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.190" end="00:15:25.460" style="s2">way to describe him they go on this holy</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.700" end="00:15:27.380" style="s2">crusade to eliminate infinitesimals from</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.460" end="00:15:30.530" style="s2">mathematics entirely and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.380" end="00:15:32.840" style="s2">philosophical people like Russell and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.530" end="00:15:34.730" style="s2">and Carnap they come in and they say</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.840" end="00:15:35.990" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s get rid of intestinal smiie</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.730" end="00:15:37.850" style="s2">everything can be quantified and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.990" end="00:15:39.440" style="s2">everything&#39;s on the grid it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.850" end="00:15:42.500" style="s2">all measurable it&#39;s all it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.440" end="00:15:44.150" style="s2">computational based then you had a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.500" end="00:15:45.380" style="s2">couple people who say well we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.150" end="00:15:46.730" style="s2">want to keep infant Testaments they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.380" end="00:15:47.689" style="s2">useful even if we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.730" end="00:15:49.189" style="s2">immediate</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.689" end="00:15:51.679" style="s2">these guys were a heavily mocked these</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.189" end="00:15:55.429" style="s2">guys were attacked by every conceivable</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.679" end="00:15:59.119" style="s2">mathematician you can think of and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.429" end="00:16:01.879" style="s2">it this this license plate the 1632 like</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.119" end="00:16:03.649" style="s2">this is that&#39;s how long this fight has</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.879" end="00:16:06.100" style="s2">been going on and it calls its holy wars</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.649" end="00:16:08.929" style="s2">there&#39;s no other way to describe it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.100" end="00:16:11.209" style="s2">eventually Kirk Godel comes along and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.929" end="00:16:13.819" style="s2">basically says it is embarrassing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.209" end="00:16:14.300" style="s2">mathematics has abandoned infant</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.819" end="00:16:15.589" style="s2">testicles</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.300" end="00:16:17.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just outright embarrassing because</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.589" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">at some point in the future we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.240" end="00:16:21.860" style="s2">look back at these things what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">were we doing well we know what the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.860" end="00:16:26.869" style="s2">we were doing Bishop Berkeley said</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">religion and logic cannot be using the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.869" end="00:16:31.850" style="s2">same tactics because ones at war with</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.769" style="s2">the other so he fragmented these things</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.850" end="00:16:35.449" style="s2">to say infinitesimal czar identical to</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.769" end="00:16:37.670" style="s2">miracles and so therefore we should ban</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.449" end="00:16:40.730" style="s2">them from mathematics and in that little</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.670" end="00:16:42.100" style="s2">action he doomed mathematical research</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.730" end="00:16:45.709" style="s2">for 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.100" end="00:16:48.499" style="s2">utterly doomed it and it didn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.709" end="00:16:49.699" style="s2">didn&#39;t it took the efforts of gödel</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.499" end="00:16:52.249" style="s2">whose last name I can&#39;t pronounce cos</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.699" end="00:16:54.619" style="s2">I&#39;m not German it took his efforts to</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.249" end="00:16:59.119" style="s2">say this is an atrocity this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.619" end="00:17:04.520" style="s2">an embarrassment all in the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.119" end="00:17:05.990" style="s2">post 30 war disaster so let&#39;s get into</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.520" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">the next part so that&#39;s impetus right</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.990" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">impetus or these these argument points</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:11.480" style="s2">these sticky things they introduced</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.409" end="00:17:13.490" style="s2">problems when you try to calculate for</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.480" end="00:17:17.419" style="s2">zero they introduced additional problems</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.490" end="00:17:18.649" style="s2">like dividing by zero for example why</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.419" end="00:17:20.659" style="s2">can&#39;t you even do that you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.649" end="00:17:23.240" style="s2">told you can&#39;t do that it&#39;s like you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.659" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">slapped math police come and kick your</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.240" end="00:17:27.529" style="s2">ass what happens well you you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:29.570" style="s2">divide by zero because if you divide 10</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.529" end="00:17:32.029" style="s2">by 0.1 you get 100 and then point zero</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.570" end="00:17:34.850" style="s2">one thousand the closer you get to zero</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.029" end="00:17:38.360" style="s2">the bigger your quotient and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.850" end="00:17:40.460" style="s2">you can&#39;t divide by zero so again if</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.360" end="00:17:42.260" style="s2">we&#39;re starting dividing by 20 then 15</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.460" end="00:17:45.080" style="s2">then you know the closer we get</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.260" end="00:17:49.820" style="s2">infinitesimally close to zero the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.080" end="00:17:52.070" style="s2">quotient becomes infinite so again</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.820" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">infinitesimal x&#39; appear and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.070" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">everything up so whenever infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.610" end="00:18:00.960" style="s2">sneak their way into a process everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">just loses their Wow it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.960" end="00:18:05.909" style="s2">telling my my ability to predict my</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.750" end="00:18:08.039" style="s2">ability to quantify right because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.909" end="00:18:10.289" style="s2">think of math is purely a quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.039" end="00:18:12.120" style="s2">thing we don&#39;t think of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.289" end="00:18:16.020" style="s2">other aspects although that&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.120" end="00:18:18.210" style="s2">very recently doesn&#39;t computation so is</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.020" end="00:18:20.549" style="s2">it infinity is anything divided by zero</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.210" end="00:18:22.399" style="s2">infinity because because of the nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.549" end="00:18:25.279" style="s2">of incontestable swell the answer is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.399" end="00:18:29.580" style="s2">and the reason the answer is no because</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.279" end="00:18:31.500" style="s2">just because you get close just get</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.580" end="00:18:33.510" style="s2">close to infinity by dividing by</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.500" end="00:18:37.340" style="s2">infinitesimal doesn&#39;t necessarily mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.510" end="00:18:42.149" style="s2">when you get to zero you get infinity so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.340" end="00:18:44.570" style="s2">it&#39;s equivalent to infinity but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.149" end="00:18:47.190" style="s2">infinity I know that&#39;s a hair-splitting</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.570" end="00:18:49.649" style="s2">stupid I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s a bet I call</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.190" end="00:18:51.870" style="s2">it unbounded so it&#39;s infinity like it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.649" end="00:18:53.880" style="s2">has all the properties of infinity but</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.870" end="00:18:55.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily infinity and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.880" end="00:18:59.279" style="s2">give you an example what that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.230" end="00:19:03.960" style="s2">an example would be in hyper reels there</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.279" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">is a concept called Omega so what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.960" end="00:19:09.750" style="s2">can do is you can take a an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.610" style="s2">series of numbers and you say all</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.750" end="00:19:13.380" style="s2">infinity all infinite series of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.610" end="00:19:15.179" style="s2">are equal according to its properties</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.380" end="00:19:17.039" style="s2">but with omegas you can both on these</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.179" end="00:19:20.070" style="s2">constructs afterwards to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.039" end="00:19:23.730" style="s2">between infinities so I&#39;m of the opinion</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.070" end="00:19:26.330" style="s2">that this makes more sense in hyper</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.730" end="00:19:28.529" style="s2">reels than it does in our number systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.330" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">but again I&#39;m probably speaking</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.529" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">gibberish and I apologize what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:36.350" style="s2">saying is there&#39;s a math system where</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">this concept of an infinity like is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.350" end="00:19:40.440" style="s2">feasible so that&#39;s why I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:42.120" style="s2">equivalent to infinity without being</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.440" end="00:19:43.860" style="s2">infinity because just because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.120" end="00:19:45.330" style="s2">using infant testicles and the trend of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.860" end="00:19:46.980" style="s2">behavior is that you&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.330" end="00:19:48.750" style="s2">infinity it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.980" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">will be when you get there so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.750" end="00:19:52.590" style="s2">this is such a sticky problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:54.809" style="s2">they just say don&#39;t do it right so again</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.590" end="00:20:01.020" style="s2">we&#39;re striking infant essa muls from</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.809" end="00:20:04.679" style="s2">math the holy war continues but what is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.020" end="00:20:07.860" style="s2">it but what we&#39;re actually describing</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.679" end="00:20:09.990" style="s2">here is a super task so what&#39;s a super</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.860" end="00:20:12.990" style="s2">task everybody here is going to do a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.990" end="00:20:14.610" style="s2">super task right now the definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.990" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">circle is a line</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.610" end="00:20:19.920" style="s2">has infinite curvature meaning a circle</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">has infinite points on it so because it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.920" end="00:20:25.230" style="s2">has infinite points on it how can I</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">Traverse a circle there I just did a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.230" end="00:20:30.690" style="s2">super task look at that Wow</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:32.340" style="s2">I&#39;m traversing a circle oh my God look</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.690" end="00:20:34.740" style="s2">at that I&#39;m crossing infinite points</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.340" end="00:20:37.230" style="s2">with my finger right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.740" end="00:20:39.720" style="s2">disconnect between infinity and actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.230" end="00:20:42.990" style="s2">work so this bridge is concept called a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.720" end="00:20:46.280" style="s2">super task it is how you complete a task</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.990" end="00:20:48.809" style="s2">that is made up of infinite actions</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.280" end="00:20:50.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s probably painful but as</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.809" end="00:20:52.110" style="s2">infinite actions hacking</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.070" end="00:20:53.400" style="s2">how can you finish it well that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.110" end="00:20:57.150" style="s2">it&#39;s going to super task because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.400" end="00:20:59.010" style="s2">super so it&#39;s so again if if a task is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.150" end="00:21:02.309" style="s2">made up of infinite actions then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.010" end="00:21:04.980" style="s2">made up of infinitesimal units right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.309" end="00:21:06.630" style="s2">it goes on forever so again now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.980" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">starting to see why this is so much for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.630" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">problem like how how are we making sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:13.320" style="s2">of infinity when when I when you can do</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.370" style="s2">a task made of infinite steps so now the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.320" end="00:21:15.840" style="s2">church has a problem with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.370" end="00:21:17.910" style="s2">mathematicians have a problem with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.840" end="00:21:25.380" style="s2">now you probably have a problem so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.910" end="00:21:34.260" style="s2">this is this is tough stuff okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.380" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">gonna do my best here there are these</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.260" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">things called prime numbers I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:42.059" style="s2">gonna get into not gonna get into it as</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.770" end="00:21:44.580" style="s2">a to function is I&#39;m not gonna get into</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.059" end="00:21:46.380" style="s2">rhyming what I&#39;m gonna say is that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.580" end="00:21:48.929" style="s2">have a mechanism that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.380" end="00:21:50.370" style="s2">predict where prime numbers appear so</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.929" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s where I&#39;m gonna start this and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.370" end="00:21:55.080" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna go from there so just</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:57.240" style="s2">this is this is the methodology to</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.080" end="00:21:59.790" style="s2">detect where Prime&#39;s appear in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.240" end="00:22:02.160" style="s2">quantity line that&#39;s all you need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.790" end="00:22:07.799" style="s2">know so this is just we&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.160" end="00:22:10.169" style="s2">Prime&#39;s right but we can only apply this</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.799" end="00:22:13.230" style="s2">when we&#39;re dealing with if this value is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.169" end="00:22:15.210" style="s2">greater than 1 and for its reflection</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.230" end="00:22:18.090" style="s2">and negative 1 which I&#39;ll get I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.210" end="00:22:21.000" style="s2">able to show that second so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.090" end="00:22:23.850" style="s2">this is my formula this is what the this</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.000" end="00:22:26.940" style="s2">is equivalent to what the the Reimann</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.850" end="00:22:28.860" style="s2">zeta function is I plug this into this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.940" end="00:22:31.350" style="s2">and then I represent</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.860" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">and all of this on a grid like so right</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.350" end="00:22:37.799" style="s2">so if I say 2 plus I it&#39;s gonna go here</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:39.740" style="s2">and then what the subsequent result of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.799" end="00:22:42.030" style="s2">this is going to be this motion</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.740" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">all right you follow me so far so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.030" end="00:22:47.790" style="s2">just gonna look at that right so again</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:51.210" style="s2">if I move my dot here I get this motion</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.790" end="00:22:54.390" style="s2">and if I move my dot here I get this</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.210" end="00:22:56.540" style="s2">motion so as long as these dots are</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.390" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">beyond this line to the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.540" end="00:23:03.150" style="s2">everything&#39;s going just fine but what</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:06.809" style="s2">happens if I put my dot here or worse</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.150" end="00:23:10.590" style="s2">here well it doesn&#39;t work the equation</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.809" end="00:23:12.660" style="s2">becomes infinite the answer becomes</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.590" end="00:23:15.330" style="s2">infinite becomes 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.660" end="00:23:18.120" style="s2">plus 5 all the way infinite so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.330" end="00:23:21.000" style="s2">put this in here so again we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.120" end="00:23:22.650" style="s2">problems with infinitesimal x&#39; yet again</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.000" end="00:23:25.950" style="s2">and this is the infinitesimal space</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.650" end="00:23:27.270" style="s2">right here so as we approach 0 we start</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.950" end="00:23:28.740" style="s2">having problems and this is showing up</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.270" end="00:23:30.750" style="s2">here as well and by the way if you solve</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.740" end="00:23:32.940" style="s2">this there&#39;s a million dollars for it so</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.750" end="00:23:34.169" style="s2">anybody wants to try and try handle this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.940" end="00:23:39.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a million dollars in solving</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.169" end="00:23:44.280" style="s2">this problem and what&#39;s most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.150" end="00:23:47.400" style="s2">is that with some finessing there is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.280" end="00:23:49.830" style="s2">way to take those limitations that were</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.400" end="00:23:51.480" style="s2">in this slide here and say ah wait a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.830" end="00:23:54.330" style="s2">second with a little bit of twisting</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.480" end="00:23:55.590" style="s2">work I can use those limitations to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.330" end="00:23:58.830" style="s2">predict where prime numbers are coming</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.590" end="00:24:00.780" style="s2">from and here&#39;s roughly what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.830" end="00:24:03.570" style="s2">equation looks like so here&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.780" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">visualizes says this is that space we</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.570" end="00:24:05.880" style="s2">were talking about where you put the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">yellow dot and you get the pretty little</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.880" end="00:24:12.510" style="s2">curves and stuff like that with</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:13.860" style="s2">something called analytical continuation</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.510" end="00:24:15.270" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think I&#39;m pronouncing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.860" end="00:24:20.850" style="s2">right you can apply this to negative</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.270" end="00:24:29.309" style="s2">numbers too what happens is if I start</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.850" end="00:24:30.929" style="s2">taking ok if I take this equation I put</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.309" end="00:24:34.740" style="s2">something here could be any number and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.929" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">follow these steps if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.740" end="00:24:41.030" style="s2">here results in 0 it will always show up</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:41.030" style="s2">on this line</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.690" end="00:24:50.350" style="s2">okay so if I so if I was to like if my</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:52.030" style="s2">dot represented zero here my red dot</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.350" end="00:24:54.640" style="s2">where I&#39;m at right now and I decided to</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.030" end="00:24:58.840" style="s2">scroll to the left and it was changing</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.640" end="00:25:03.040" style="s2">the value that was in that S you would</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.840" end="00:25:05.500" style="s2">see the following structure so this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.040" end="00:25:09.010" style="s2">me at zero and then as I&#39;m increasing in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.500" end="00:25:12.790" style="s2">time T T time right here and I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.010" end="00:25:14.980" style="s2">T into my equation the output starts</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.790" end="00:25:17.080" style="s2">looking like a spiral a corkscrew</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.980" end="00:25:19.530" style="s2">that continuously intersects with that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.080" end="00:25:24.700" style="s2">half line over and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.530" end="00:25:29.530" style="s2">and it is this motion that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.700" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">figure out where prime numbers are which</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.530" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">is wild anyway that&#39;s why this guy&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:38.980" style="s2">freaking genius but this is purely in</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:43.630" style="s2">the infinitesimal space so now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.980" end="00:25:46.090" style="s2">case where like oh okay in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.630" end="00:25:47.890" style="s2">weird zone where we&#39;ve seen three</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.090" end="00:25:49.270" style="s2">problems previously that the church had</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.890" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">and that we had and that the internet</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.270" end="00:25:54.370" style="s2">had you see a little bit of ray of hope</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:56.110" style="s2">really oh there&#39;s something there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.370" end="00:26:00.610" style="s2">additional property about this space</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.110" end="00:26:01.660" style="s2">that is unique to all the spaces and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.610" end="00:26:04.780" style="s2">going to come back to this in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.660" end="00:26:07.770" style="s2">but this is basically if I just to recap</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.780" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">I take that function and I apply I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.770" end="00:26:11.980" style="s2">continuously add the value that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2">putting in the function and I get this</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.980" end="00:26:16.300" style="s2">motion of behavior and this motion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.470" end="00:26:18.610" style="s2">behavior is indicative of a prime number</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.300" end="00:26:20.680" style="s2">which is a key part of encryption and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.610" end="00:26:22.780" style="s2">all kinds of so that wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">was a weird thing that was found and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.780" end="00:26:27.310" style="s2">this is confirmed up to a trillion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">these loops so we&#39;ve been able to figure</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.310" end="00:26:31.270" style="s2">out we can take these loops from here to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.370" style="s2">a trillion and we can find them and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.270" end="00:26:35.430" style="s2">can predict up to a trillion prime</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.370" end="00:26:37.510" style="s2">numbers based on this structure alone</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.430" end="00:26:40.150" style="s2">but we&#39;re still not confident enough to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.510" end="00:26:42.430" style="s2">say that this is a proof and it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.150" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">in all cases still not quite there yet I</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.430" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get there either</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.900" end="00:26:54.220" style="s2">but is this a super task that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.140" end="00:26:55.299" style="s2">know that is the outstanding question I</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.220" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.299" end="00:26:58.929" style="s2">because if this is a super task where</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:27:00.369" style="s2">you&#39;re taking an infinite number where</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.929" end="00:27:02.009" style="s2">you&#39;re taking action and resolving</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.369" end="00:27:04.389" style="s2">something that has an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.009" end="00:27:06.369" style="s2">operations if it is made up of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.389" end="00:27:09.309" style="s2">incontestably more in operations then</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.369" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t this a super task and if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.309" end="00:27:12.730" style="s2">answer is yes then we might have an</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">answer to this the answer is no then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.730" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">got to figure out why I&#39;m gonna dump</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:18.309" style="s2">like this is confident this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.440" style="s2">complicated I don&#39;t blame you if I lost</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.309" end="00:27:21.789" style="s2">you on this but I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna jump</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.440" end="00:27:23.139" style="s2">back I&#39;m gonna make this more</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.789" end="00:27:25.480" style="s2">entertaining this is like the hard stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.139" end="00:27:26.830" style="s2">this is this the only hard stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.480" end="00:27:30.879" style="s2">let&#39;s get into the fun stuff let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.830" end="00:27:32.859" style="s2">back okay so this called the mikowski</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.879" end="00:27:33.909" style="s2">hypersurface of the present and this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.859" end="00:27:36.429" style="s2">supposed to be the fun stuff my</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.909" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">apologies right so what this means is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.429" end="00:27:44.440" style="s2">you are here at all times</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:47.499" style="s2">your eyeballs your life is here at this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.440" end="00:27:49.899" style="s2">dot and it never leaves this done so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.499" end="00:27:52.509" style="s2">future happens to you and then it</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.899" end="00:27:55.059" style="s2">becomes the past and however the future</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.509" end="00:27:57.549" style="s2">modifies you so you turn your head it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.059" end="00:27:59.049" style="s2">will then rotate that cone or if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.549" end="00:28:00.879" style="s2">move somewhere else in the hypersurface</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.049" end="00:28:03.369" style="s2">this whole thing being my hypersurface</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.879" end="00:28:08.460" style="s2">it will rotate that cone and move where</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.369" end="00:28:10.690" style="s2">it cone is so this is how most of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.460" end="00:28:12.759" style="s2">calculations about how time affects</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.690" end="00:28:16.210" style="s2">people and observers this is the model</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.759" end="00:28:19.330" style="s2">that&#39;s used for almost all of it the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.210" end="00:28:21.159" style="s2">idea is that the now the future is some</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.330" end="00:28:25.139" style="s2">infinite thing the past is some infinite</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.159" end="00:28:30.850" style="s2">thing and then now well what is the now</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.139" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">is it zero is it zero time no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.850" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">zero time it&#39;s an infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.929" end="00:28:44.270" style="s2">how can I say that how can I say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.580" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">now is an infinitesimal because every</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.270" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">conceivable metric of applied linear</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:50.059" style="s2">time contains an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.980" style="s2">these infinitesimally slices how do i</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.059" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">know that because i can divide time by</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.980" end="00:28:56.270" style="s2">two forever i can get to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:28:58.370" style="s2">infinitesimal space when i define time i</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.270" end="00:28:59.960" style="s2">can say that you can say that a seconds</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.370" end="00:29:02.090" style="s2">made of a thousand milliseconds okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.960" end="00:29:04.460" style="s2">well how many nano seconds is that how</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.090" end="00:29:06.590" style="s2">many Pico seconds is that you play the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.460" end="00:29:10.490" style="s2">game all the way down at some point it</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.590" end="00:29:12.289" style="s2">is an infinite number of slices and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.490" end="00:29:13.880" style="s2">what this model is proposing is that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.289" end="00:29:15.919" style="s2">are moving through these slices of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.880" end="00:29:17.960" style="s2">transitioning through these slices at</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.919" end="00:29:22.850" style="s2">all the times so every second is</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.960" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">actually a super task you are completing</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.850" end="00:29:27.529" style="s2">an infinite number of actions every</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:30.770" style="s2">second and that&#39;s what this model relies</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.529" end="00:29:32.779" style="s2">on so now we&#39;re now we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.770" end="00:29:35.179" style="s2">see that Oh infant s emelles actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.779" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">haven&#39;t have an impact that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.179" end="00:29:39.559" style="s2">time and now is the impetus and there</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:44.390" style="s2">are infinite numbers of them per second</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.559" end="00:29:45.980" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;ve been using this</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.390" end="00:29:48.590" style="s2">entire time to make all of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.980" end="00:29:50.179" style="s2">cosmological and quantum projections but</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.590" end="00:29:52.700" style="s2">as you can imagine there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.179" end="00:29:55.539" style="s2">problems here so let&#39;s explore but first</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.700" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">let me make one more posit here</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.539" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">mathematics has been trending</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">anthropomorphic ly towards the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:04.760" style="s2">treating time as an infinitesimal slice</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:08.110" style="s2">and the reason we&#39;ve been doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.760" end="00:30:11.480" style="s2">because we can&#39;t stop seeing causality</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.110" end="00:30:15.770" style="s2">we see it in everything we do we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.480" end="00:30:17.240" style="s2">actually stop ourselves from from we</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.770" end="00:30:19.429" style="s2">can&#39;t suspend our disbelief from</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.240" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">connecting in an action to another</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.429" end="00:30:24.740" style="s2">action if if I&#39;m hungry I go eat that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">causality if I&#39;m if I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.740" end="00:30:27.799" style="s2">somewhere I&#39;m gonna walk somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:30.710" style="s2">that&#39;s causality so we have this linear</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.799" end="00:30:32.899" style="s2">perception of cause and effect and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.710" end="00:30:34.779" style="s2">way we justify that in math is by</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.899" end="00:30:36.950" style="s2">treating now as an infant asthma</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.779" end="00:30:38.299" style="s2">meanwhile in everywhere else in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.950" end="00:30:40.730" style="s2">mathematics and contessa moles are</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.299" end="00:30:43.100" style="s2">effectively bad so we have a we have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.730" end="00:30:47.480" style="s2">model problem here and I&#39;ll explain why</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.100" end="00:30:49.880" style="s2">this is a challenge and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.480" end="00:30:50.480" style="s2">exactly the example that I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.880" end="00:30:53.179" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.480" end="00:30:55.750" style="s2">you know physicists are just straight-up</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.179" end="00:30:59.660" style="s2">inventing and assuming stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.750" end="00:31:01.549" style="s2">specifically the symmetry part this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.660" end="00:31:05.929" style="s2">where all the trouble starting that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.549" end="00:31:08.450" style="s2">describing at least so now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.929" end="00:31:11.360" style="s2">go back to Zeno and we&#39;re gonna say each</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.450" end="00:31:13.700" style="s2">one of these slices of now the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.360" end="00:31:17.000" style="s2">infinitesimal now what&#39;s going Toa time</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.700" end="00:31:22.280" style="s2">slice as these time slices accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.000" end="00:31:24.169" style="s2">over time the ball raises so we are we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.280" end="00:31:28.370" style="s2">are representing motions one slice at a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.169" end="00:31:29.660" style="s2">time one infinitesimal at a time but</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.370" end="00:31:31.190" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s Greece they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.660" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">have statistical correlation they have</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.190" end="00:31:35.090" style="s2">no way of relating these time slices</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:38.360" style="s2">together so they say that motion is</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.090" end="00:31:39.770" style="s2">impossible elisee noted of course Euclid</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.360" end="00:31:42.169" style="s2">came along and says but I have legs</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.770" end="00:31:44.390" style="s2">though of course motions possible right</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.169" end="00:31:47.390" style="s2">so this is the heart of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.390" end="00:31:49.820" style="s2">right here we have never resolved this</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.390" end="00:31:55.130" style="s2">problem we have come up with band-aids</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.820" end="00:31:57.919" style="s2">and tricks and Fuxi know and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.130" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">you clean I don&#39;t care and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.919" end="00:32:04.429" style="s2">just extended upon this argument because</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:06.830" style="s2">we are obsessed with the idea of time</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.429" end="00:32:09.799" style="s2">being this linear construct because well</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.830" end="00:32:13.700" style="s2">Euclid decided we have legs and that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.799" end="00:32:14.690" style="s2">the end of the argument it stays this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.700" end="00:32:17.540" style="s2">way for a while</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.690" end="00:32:19.370" style="s2">then he gets a Newton again who is now</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.540" end="00:32:20.840" style="s2">coming with the ratio of velocity</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.370" end="00:32:23.419" style="s2">different times means you can predict</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.150" end="00:32:32.660" style="s2">he used ratio of velocity to come up</p>

<p begin="00:32:40.370" end="00:32:48.980" style="s2">up now the problem here is that if you</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.980" end="00:32:53.870" style="s2">end up with future projections of where</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.700" end="00:33:35.480" style="s2">stitching together at a time and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.050" end="00:33:37.490" style="s2">artifact of that stitching is that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.480" end="00:33:40.970" style="s2">can you can see the future but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.490" end="00:33:42.770" style="s2">no way in which by by modeling the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.970" end="00:33:44.900" style="s2">future you are also automatically</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.770" end="00:33:47.090" style="s2">modeling the past and so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.900" end="00:33:49.550" style="s2">doing is you&#39;re creating this incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.090" end="00:33:51.260" style="s2">construct of time symmetry and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.550" end="00:33:52.900" style="s2">allowing it in your mental space and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.260" end="00:33:57.430" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing it in your calculations</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.900" end="00:33:59.960" style="s2">and so it kind of implies that time is</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.430" end="00:34:01.310" style="s2">reversible so you get these weird</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.960" end="00:34:03.470" style="s2">suggestions in your head and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.310" end="00:34:05.740" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here well</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.470" end="00:34:11.120" style="s2">then Einstein comes along and he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.740" end="00:34:12.740" style="s2">well let&#39;s that&#39;s not true there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.120" end="00:34:14.030" style="s2">experiments I can come up with to show</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.740" end="00:34:16.700" style="s2">you that it&#39;s not true and the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.030" end="00:34:18.050" style="s2">experiment the way that that Einstein</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.700" end="00:34:20.090" style="s2">looked at it he said that all events</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.050" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">were happening at the same time there</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.090" end="00:34:23.929" style="s2">was no past present or future or</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">anything it was all happening at all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.929" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">time it just dependent where you stood</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:30.139" style="s2">to see it so an example that would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:31.909" style="s2">like looking at a star you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.139" end="00:34:33.050" style="s2">looking at the star right now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.909" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">looking at the light from it that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.050" end="00:34:37.010" style="s2">happened about a million years ago a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:38.120" style="s2">billion years ago so if you stands</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.010" end="00:34:39.350" style="s2">somewhere else you&#39;re gonna see that</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.120" end="00:34:41.750" style="s2">light at a very different perspective</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.350" end="00:34:43.190" style="s2">but they&#39;re very different time and if</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.750" end="00:34:45.710" style="s2">you&#39;re moving at the speed of light then</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.190" end="00:34:48.350" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna change how you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.710" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">all this entirely so your your velocity</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.350" end="00:34:52.490" style="s2">as you&#39;re moving through this space</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:54.350" style="s2">determines what you see so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.490" end="00:34:56.690" style="s2">make a statement about time being</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.350" end="00:34:58.220" style="s2">absolute or being able to predict how</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.690" end="00:34:59.900" style="s2">events move through time or how they</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.220" end="00:35:01.580" style="s2">correlate the only thing you can say</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.900" end="00:35:04.970" style="s2">with confidence or at least as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.580" end="00:35:06.140" style="s2">byproduct of of your of this approach is</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.970" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">by saying that all events are happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.140" end="00:35:13.460" style="s2">all the time of course this leads</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:16.820" style="s2">directly Heisenberg who comes up with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.460" end="00:35:18.380" style="s2">much more axiomatic observation and</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.820" end="00:35:19.340" style="s2">says well let&#39;s just look at these time</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.380" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">slices let&#39;s look at these</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:23.540" style="s2">infinitesimally say I just have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:26.150" style="s2">snapshot of it I can&#39;t tell you anything</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.540" end="00:35:27.650" style="s2">about where it&#39;s going I just I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.150" end="00:35:29.690" style="s2">where this thing is right now at this</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.650" end="00:35:33.020" style="s2">infinitesimal I couldn&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.690" end="00:35:34.520" style="s2">where it&#39;s gonna go next so he basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.020" end="00:35:36.470" style="s2">found a way to reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.520" end="00:35:41.570" style="s2">infinitesimal argument by putting infant</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.470" end="00:35:44.090" style="s2">s levels in the impetus holes and all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.570" end="00:35:46.850" style="s2">these no matter how you cut this it all</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.090" end="00:35:51.500" style="s2">leads to the same thing the illusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.850" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">that time is symmetrical now whether the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.500" end="00:35:55.700" style="s2">mathematician keeps the discipline</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:57.260" style="s2">involved and says oh well you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.700" end="00:35:59.570" style="s2">not going to let that implication</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.260" end="00:36:02.450" style="s2">influence me or not sure okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.570" end="00:36:06.170" style="s2">individual discipline aside but all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.450" end="00:36:07.640" style="s2">models allow for a reversal of time so</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:09.620" style="s2">this is one of those weird byproducts</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.640" end="00:36:11.360" style="s2">and this is entirely because of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.620" end="00:36:12.350" style="s2">infinitesimal representation of time</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.360" end="00:36:14.810" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been doing because of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.350" end="00:36:16.760" style="s2">hyper surface present of now where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.810" end="00:36:18.020" style="s2">future happens to us and past goes away</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.760" end="00:36:24.230" style="s2">and we&#39;re just sitting at this little</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.020" end="00:36:27.080" style="s2">plane so how do we how do you reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.230" end="00:36:30.050" style="s2">this but first you have to reconcile it</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.080" end="00:36:32.150" style="s2">because time isn&#39;t symmetrical time is</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.050" end="00:36:35.120" style="s2">asymmetrical meaning when the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:38.150" style="s2">happens it doesn&#39;t roll back in time and</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.120" end="00:36:39.620" style="s2">we have five examples of this we have at</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.150" end="00:36:41.000" style="s2">the subjective level our actions and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.620" end="00:36:42.920" style="s2">decisions affect the future but not the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.000" end="00:36:45.380" style="s2">past we can all experimentally prove</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.920" end="00:36:46.970" style="s2">that at the electromagnetic level we</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.380" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">send signals to the future but not to</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.970" end="00:36:50.060" style="s2">the past if we could send futures to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:51.710" style="s2">past and we&#39;d all be rich because we</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.060" end="00:36:54.740" style="s2">hacked the stock market so there you go</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.710" end="00:36:56.210" style="s2">right that&#39;s out thermodynamic isolation</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.740" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">low entropy when it comes to things</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.210" end="00:37:00.650" style="s2">heating and informing organization</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">things tend to get disorganized as time</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.650" end="00:37:03.020" style="s2">goes on you can&#39;t put that can&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.100" style="s2">that back in the box</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.020" end="00:37:08.810" style="s2">so we see time asymmetry there -</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.100" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">cosmological universe was small on hot</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.810" end="00:37:13.460" style="s2">and it&#39;s getting large and cold it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:17.060" style="s2">turning into a real bad marriage you</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.460" end="00:37:19.310" style="s2">know and so that&#39;s more evidence of tiny</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.060" end="00:37:23.500" style="s2">asymmetry and then the CP violation is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.310" end="00:37:25.940" style="s2">some physics nature saying here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.500" end="00:37:29.000" style="s2">reasons why there&#39;s more matter than not</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.940" end="00:37:30.170" style="s2">matter so we have five examples that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.000" end="00:37:33.170" style="s2">pretty hard the disk</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.170" end="00:37:34.940" style="s2">about times asymmetry meaning time goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.170" end="00:37:36.619" style="s2">in one direction but not the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.940" end="00:37:41.150" style="s2">it goes positive but it does not go</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.619" end="00:37:43.849" style="s2">negative so when our math structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.150" end="00:37:46.309" style="s2">tells us that time is symmetrical and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.849" end="00:37:48.440" style="s2">can deal with it symmetrically this is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.309" end="00:37:50.059" style="s2">byproduct of dealing with time as an</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.440" end="00:37:53.539" style="s2">infant testable without coming to grips</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.059" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">about infant estimates so we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.539" end="00:37:58.789" style="s2">some pretty big mistakes here and</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s an infinitesimal we just</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.789" end="00:38:02.660" style="s2">write it off it&#39;s like I like point zero</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:04.190" style="s2">zero zero zero one we just drop but</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.660" end="00:38:06.500" style="s2">we&#39;re still shrinking the infinitesimal</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.190" end="00:38:07.940" style="s2">just like Newton did we&#39;ve just come up</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.500" end="00:38:11.089" style="s2">with these complicated mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.940" end="00:38:12.619" style="s2">constructs to explain why it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.089" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">shrink it without actually addressing</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.619" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">the nature of the infinitesimal itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.660" end="00:38:22.519" style="s2">let me yeah it&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.900" end="00:38:25.369" style="s2">fundamental time arrow so time arrow</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.519" end="00:38:29.029" style="s2">meaning direction of time as I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.369" end="00:38:33.650" style="s2">describing and then we have H theorem</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.029" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">which is Boltzmann so H theorem means</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.650" end="00:38:37.970" style="s2">gas atoms trend towards normalization</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:41.029" style="s2">normalized speed distribution meaning if</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.970" end="00:38:42.589" style="s2">I have a box right this it&#39;s a box I</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.029" end="00:38:44.119" style="s2">fill it up with gas atoms and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.589" end="00:38:46.099" style="s2">bounce around each other like billiard</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.119" end="00:38:48.259" style="s2">balls all day long eventually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.099" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">just going to cool down and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.259" end="00:38:52.970" style="s2">going to reach a normal distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:56.119" style="s2">speed between them instead of being hot</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.970" end="00:38:58.670" style="s2">all the time so this is where things get</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.119" end="00:39:01.640" style="s2">clever and if you&#39;ve been following my</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.670" end="00:39:05.349" style="s2">argument what I&#39;m about to say next is</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.450" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">this is going to form a brick over time</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.490" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">then I can&#39;t tell the difference between</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.059" end="00:43:08.099" style="s2">of this so if we continue to treat time</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.309" end="00:43:09.780" style="s2">like in Contessa moles then error rates</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.099" end="00:43:12.450" style="s2">and projection of entropy are no</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.780" end="00:43:16.520" style="s2">different than time reversal and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.450" end="00:43:18.930" style="s2">why this is such a big problem and</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.520" end="00:43:21.089" style="s2">somewhere a mathematician is probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.930" end="00:43:24.349" style="s2">having an aneurysm about that I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.089" end="00:43:24.349" style="s2">in advance so</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.460" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to deal time as in</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.559" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">Contessa moles then we have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.170" style="s2">about dealing the time as a super task</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">which means anything you&#39;re using to</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.170" end="00:43:44.230" style="s2">measure action to go through your your</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:48.130" style="s2">hyper present your hyper your hyper</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.230" end="00:43:50.349" style="s2">surface of the now anything that crosses</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.130" end="00:43:52.450" style="s2">that boundary is engaging in a super</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.349" end="00:43:54.630" style="s2">task of infant testicles and we do not</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.450" end="00:43:56.980" style="s2">have the mathematics to represent that</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.630" end="00:43:58.660" style="s2">which is why we end up in the problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.980" end="00:44:03.030" style="s2">where we can&#39;t tell our air rates from</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.660" end="00:44:06.099" style="s2">time reversal and why they&#39;re equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.030" end="00:44:10.510" style="s2">so this leads us to all kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.180" end="00:45:58.210" style="s2">referenced how Newton was actually</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.210" end="00:46:01.150" style="s2">got into calculus and he said how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:03.070" style="s2">gonna be relevant towards the end I</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.150" end="00:46:04.359" style="s2">think I may have missed that can you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.070" end="00:46:06.550" style="s2">spell that out a little further</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.359" end="00:46:08.859" style="s2">yeah the he was an arc yo crypto</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.550" end="00:46:11.230" style="s2">cartographer so he was obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.859" end="00:46:13.450" style="s2">trying to break what he perceived as</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.230" end="00:46:15.900" style="s2">cryptography everywhere basically he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.450" end="00:46:19.270" style="s2">a conspiracy theorist</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.900" end="00:46:21.190" style="s2">so he was trying to crack encrypt from</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.270" end="00:46:22.900" style="s2">wherever he saw it whether it was stego</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.190" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">whether it was hard encrypted herself</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.900" end="00:46:31.420" style="s2">encrypted and if what he was describing</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:33.400" style="s2">as an infant essa Mille as a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.420" end="00:46:34.900" style="s2">of time which he did in his equations he</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.400" end="00:46:36.849" style="s2">said you had to put in Contessa milles</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.900" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">in there initially the world made fun of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.849" end="00:46:41.349" style="s2">him for that but he wasn&#39;t wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:43.660" style="s2">he had put you had to put the infant s</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.349" end="00:46:46.839" style="s2">holes in there to get it started to</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.660" end="00:46:48.310" style="s2">start that seed what I&#39;m proposing is</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.839" end="00:46:52.560" style="s2">that that infant s Amell is a byproduct</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.310" end="00:46:52.560" style="s2">of a cryptographic asymmetrical process</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.950" end="00:46:57.280" style="s2">so it makes sense by a cryptographer a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.720" end="00:46:59.770" style="s2">person who&#39;s coming from a cryptographic</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.280" end="00:47:01.150" style="s2">background would append to that in there</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.770" end="00:47:02.680" style="s2">as an exception because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.150" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">dealing with cryptography you are driven</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.680" end="00:47:07.210" style="s2">by exceptions most often than not and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:10.920" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the relationship which I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.210" end="00:47:13.859" style="s2">permit in spell out so well hmm</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.920" end="00:47:18.070" style="s2">follow-up question is emerging what</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.859" end="00:47:22.450" style="s2">implications does this framing have on</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.070" end="00:47:25.630" style="s2">the simulation hypothesis all of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.450" end="00:47:29.380" style="s2">simulation hypothesis needs to explain</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.630" end="00:47:32.890" style="s2">how time runs through it in order for it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.380" end="00:47:36.280" style="s2">to be examined and tested so if I was to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.890" end="00:47:37.510" style="s2">say the simulation is whatever whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.280" end="00:47:39.550" style="s2">thing a lot there on the air on say</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.510" end="00:47:42.849" style="s2">that&#39;s the simulation I need to answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.550" end="00:47:45.980" style="s2">is time relative local is it calculated</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.849" end="00:47:47.960" style="s2">as cryptographic what are the properties</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.980" end="00:47:50.390" style="s2">time itself is that a line is it a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.960" end="00:47:52.430" style="s2">quantity we&#39;ve been treating time like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.390" end="00:47:54.380" style="s2">quantity for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.430" end="00:47:58.280" style="s2">only recently we&#39;re starting to look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.380" end="00:48:00.590" style="s2">time as a as a set of ordinals but</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.280" end="00:48:05.150" style="s2">that&#39;s not the only possibility as time</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.590" end="00:48:06.680" style="s2">can be a living function and that&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.150" end="00:48:10.970" style="s2">haven&#39;t even gotten quite there yet so</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.680" end="00:48:13.490" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s in order to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.970" end="00:48:15.410" style="s2">your simulations clock is you got to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.490" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">start poking and prodding what the clock</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.410" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t and then it could get down to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:22.280" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m proposing is that if</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.680" style="s2">infinitesimal ZAR byproduct of how all</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.280" end="00:48:26.330" style="s2">of our maths are dealing with time then</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.680" end="00:48:30.010" style="s2">perhaps we can test to see if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.330" end="00:48:33.230" style="s2">simulation doing the same thing mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.010" end="00:48:34.550" style="s2">it&#39;s one final question for me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.230" end="00:48:37.609" style="s2">know if I fully appreciated the</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.550" end="00:48:40.609" style="s2">implications of mathematicians using</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.609" end="00:48:43.460" style="s2">models of symmetrical time if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.609" end="00:48:45.710" style="s2">just kind of assuming you know using you</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.460" end="00:48:48.109" style="s2">know in practice using discipline to not</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.710" end="00:48:49.340" style="s2">assume you can go backwards in time what</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.109" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">are the implications that are still</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.340" end="00:48:55.100" style="s2">bleeding into all the other downstream</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:57.020" style="s2">effects of using that as a model yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.100" end="00:48:58.970" style="s2">you get all kinds of dumb cultural</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.020" end="00:49:02.180" style="s2">artifacts guess like the multiverse</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.970" end="00:49:04.550" style="s2">so uh come on like give me a break you</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.180" end="00:49:06.410" style="s2">start getting these weird constructs to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.550" end="00:49:08.690" style="s2">represent stuff cos like oh you get</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.410" end="00:49:10.430" style="s2">these like these regret wishes or I wish</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.690" end="00:49:12.260" style="s2">I could go back in time and you dead</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.430" end="00:49:13.880" style="s2">point to a magnet say that&#39;s it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.260" end="00:49:15.470" style="s2">that&#39;s good for time for recruiting</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.880" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">mathematicians right so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.470" end="00:49:22.130" style="s2">function to that when they&#39;re kids</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:24.260" style="s2">whatever but it&#39;s yeah it is all</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.130" end="00:49:26.690" style="s2">derivative of basically making fun of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.260" end="00:49:28.100" style="s2">Newton that&#39;s that&#39;s what it boils down</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.690" end="00:49:29.480" style="s2">to you said your infant essa moles are</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.100" end="00:49:30.920" style="s2">garbage and he may have been describing</p>

<p begin="00:49:30.920" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">just weren&#39;t ready for it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.050" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">cool I&#39;m gonna start picking questions</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.210" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">from the chat</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.570" end="00:49:47.890" style="s2">Peter Wang would you like to ask your</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.710" end="00:49:50.660" style="s2">question yes hi so very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.890" end="00:49:53.020" style="s2">exposition here in all of this I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.660" end="00:49:56.390" style="s2">there&#39;s still a metaphysical frame that</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.020" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">time is this thing that can be sliced is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.390" end="00:49:58.850" style="s2">this sort of your point right that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:00.349" style="s2">can treat as inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.850" end="00:50:02.359" style="s2">I think forest</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.349" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">and I myself sort of came to this kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.359" end="00:50:05.869" style="s2">of in a different way but since card</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:07.810" style="s2">revelation to talk it for slander the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.869" end="00:50:09.980" style="s2">first time about this but this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.810" end="00:50:13.010" style="s2">and I come to this as a physicist right</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.980" end="00:50:15.530" style="s2">so our assumption or metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.010" end="00:50:17.270" style="s2">assumption that that we&#39;re just okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.530" end="00:50:19.430" style="s2">with Zeno&#39;s paradox right we really</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.270" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">haven&#39;t broken out of xenos problem we</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.430" end="00:50:22.609" style="s2">sort of elide this as a supertastic</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:22.910" style="s2">saying well you know don&#39;t worry about</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.609" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.910" end="00:50:26.900" style="s2">but but my comment earlier about you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.330" style="s2">really not talked about the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.900" end="00:50:30.830" style="s2">energy at all right because even when</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.330" end="00:50:33.470" style="s2">you talk about Newton and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.830" end="00:50:34.790" style="s2">the tangent and and the differentials</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.470" end="00:50:36.619" style="s2">and all these things it&#39;s a kinematic</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.790" end="00:50:40.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a description of the thing but but</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.619" end="00:50:42.530" style="s2">really I think the idea that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.040" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">basically said let me try to say this in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.530" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">English asked my question asked an</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:47.960" style="s2">actual question the question is</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:50.839" style="s2">would you what do you think of this of</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.960" end="00:50:53.420" style="s2">this view that if there is something</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.839" end="00:50:55.820" style="s2">nonzero to time we would try to pin time</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.420" end="00:50:57.500" style="s2">down on the same static cutting board</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.820" end="00:50:59.270" style="s2">that we put everything else static and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.500" end="00:51:00.890" style="s2">physical space we thin slices</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.270" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">infinitesimally and here it is and now</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.890" end="00:51:02.930" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of screwed because we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">tell if we&#39;re going one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.930" end="00:51:07.040" style="s2">way in time what if we say you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.390" style="s2">it that&#39;s actually there is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.040" end="00:51:10.849" style="s2">thing of time that does move forward</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.390" end="00:51:11.960" style="s2">obviously and is irreversible what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.849" end="00:51:13.550" style="s2">just simply done with the car</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.960" end="00:51:15.250" style="s2">metaphysics is we squished all that</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.550" end="00:51:18.109" style="s2">dynamism to something we call energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.250" end="00:51:19.250" style="s2">potential or kinetic its energy so if</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.109" end="00:51:20.690" style="s2">you actually go and say you know time is</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.250" end="00:51:23.150" style="s2">not infinitely sliceable</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.690" end="00:51:25.250" style="s2">it&#39;s thick and the thickness of it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.150" end="00:51:27.140" style="s2">actually energy now you have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.250" end="00:51:28.820" style="s2">completely new metaphysical frame for a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.140" end="00:51:30.740" style="s2">new kind of physics that says no no you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.820" end="00:51:32.869" style="s2">cannot just do simple decomposition into</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.740" end="00:51:34.520" style="s2">static objects with some thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.869" end="00:51:36.050" style="s2">you call potential energy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.520" end="00:51:38.990" style="s2">infinitely devised divisible right</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.050" end="00:51:40.520" style="s2">anyway you say I&#39;m going so we see I see</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.990" end="00:51:42.109" style="s2">exactly where you&#39;re going and I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.520" end="00:51:43.460" style="s2">want to go there and the reason I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.109" end="00:51:45.859" style="s2">want to go there is cuz it leads to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.460" end="00:51:47.060" style="s2">very uncomfortable conclusion and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.859" end="00:51:48.830" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna have to share it I said</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.060" end="00:51:52.280" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t Daniel before I did this I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.830" end="00:51:55.099" style="s2">think because you&#39;re there I have to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.280" end="00:51:56.930" style="s2">more I look at this and I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.099" end="00:52:00.349" style="s2">batshit insane enough and I&#39;m about to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.930" end="00:52:02.780" style="s2">take it I&#39;m gonna take a exponential</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.349" end="00:52:06.770" style="s2">step into greater batshit insanity by</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.780" end="00:52:08.240" style="s2">saying this the more I&#39;m looking at time</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.770" end="00:52:09.560" style="s2">and the reason I didn&#39;t go into energy</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.240" end="00:52:11.720" style="s2">is because I wanted to focus primarily</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.560" end="00:52:13.460" style="s2">on the infinitesimal nature of time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.720" end="00:52:14.930" style="s2">and how we&#39;re treating it the problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.460" end="00:52:17.210" style="s2">of in Testaments and what that means to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.930" end="00:52:18.470" style="s2">entropy because if you can&#39;t tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.210" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">difference between an error rate and</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.470" end="00:52:26.119" style="s2">going backwards in time then there we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:27.590" style="s2">hit a problem so the way around that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.119" end="00:52:30.410" style="s2">to start dealing with what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.590" end="00:52:31.880" style="s2">non-standard analysis and I&#39;m gonna lose</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.300" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">deals with model theory and it deals</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.830" end="00:52:40.369" style="s2">with things called hyper reals and hypo</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:42.080" style="s2">complexes which is a way of saying it</p>

<p begin="00:52:47.810" end="00:52:53.180" style="s2">using a notation and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.119" end="00:52:56.180" style="s2">start formulating there&#39;s a convoluted</p>

<p begin="00:52:56.180" end="00:53:00.109" style="s2">hyper reals so you get the</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.660" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">starting to look like numbers are alive</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.180" end="00:53:21.010" style="s2">and that&#39;s where I&#39;d lose everybody by</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.160" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">saying that so you&#39;re calling it energy</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.010" end="00:53:26.720" style="s2">but in mathematics in hyper-real land</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:29.030" style="s2">these it&#39;s not that it&#39;s a number on a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.720" end="00:53:31.730" style="s2">line it&#39;s not that it&#39;s a quantity or an</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.030" end="00:53:33.859" style="s2">ordinal &#39;ti it&#39;s that the number is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.730" end="00:53:35.990" style="s2">continuously reasserting itself over</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.859" end="00:53:40.040" style="s2">time and that&#39;s how they&#39;re able to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.990" end="00:53:41.000" style="s2">oh yeah now that actually makes total</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.040" end="00:53:43.880" style="s2">sense right it&#39;s very much in line with</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.000" end="00:53:45.260" style="s2">Wolfram&#39;s sort of it also it also kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.880" end="00:53:48.050" style="s2">of gets the heart of why Wolfram is so</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.260" end="00:53:49.790" style="s2">impressed with his work on iterating</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.050" end="00:53:51.349" style="s2">agents right it&#39;s like anytime you apply</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.790" end="00:53:52.820" style="s2">discretization to a thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.349" end="00:53:54.710" style="s2">fundamentally alive and constantly</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.820" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">dynamic you&#39;re gonna end up with magical</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.710" end="00:53:58.130" style="s2">things that fall out of the room are in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:53:59.720" style="s2">the residue yeah because you squished</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.130" end="00:54:03.980" style="s2">all of the dynamism out of it including</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.720" end="00:54:06.109" style="s2">emergent things yeah okay interests yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.980" end="00:54:09.170" style="s2">and so that&#39;s yeah so the hyper real</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.109" end="00:54:14.839" style="s2">basic long story short the time is</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.170" end="00:54:17.270" style="s2">implied and part of and that&#39;s wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.839" end="00:54:19.790" style="s2">a second yes with time isn&#39;t this like</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.270" end="00:54:21.710" style="s2">thing that we bolt on or measure against</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.790" end="00:54:24.080" style="s2">it&#39;s actually implicit into the number</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.710" end="00:54:25.700" style="s2">that&#39;s like I said that&#39;s why I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.080" end="00:54:27.350" style="s2">that&#39;s why I say when I say</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.700" end="00:54:29.140" style="s2">numbers are alive I&#39;m talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.350" end="00:54:31.850" style="s2">particular aspect which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.140" end="00:54:33.290" style="s2">20-year talk after this one mass so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.850" end="00:54:34.730" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.290" end="00:54:36.610" style="s2">bringing it up thanks for the answer</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.730" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.610" end="00:54:47.720" style="s2">all right Alexander Lee do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:49.310" style="s2">ask you a question so well in light of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.720" end="00:54:52.730" style="s2">the last conversation now I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.310" end="00:54:54.500" style="s2">thinking about that but it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.730" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a way to sort of map</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.500" end="00:55:00.080" style="s2">numbers and functions together so I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:02.630" style="s2">wondering if you care to comment on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.080" end="00:55:05.540" style="s2">intersection between information entropy</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:08.260" style="s2">and thermodynamic entropy especially</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.540" end="00:55:11.930" style="s2">with Schrodinger&#39;s negentropy and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.260" end="00:55:13.940" style="s2">see well whatever I&#39;ll stop there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.930" end="00:55:17.150" style="s2">a big one no please continue it might</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.940" end="00:55:22.040" style="s2">help me out okay well so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.150" end="00:55:24.200" style="s2">talking about entropy as is it well well</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.040" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">you can see entropy sort of as different</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.200" end="00:55:29.990" style="s2">so you have microstates and you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.400" style="s2">macro States and so the point which</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.990" end="00:55:32.570" style="s2">should have a gradient or you have some</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.400" end="00:55:34.520" style="s2">straight difference is where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.570" end="00:55:36.230" style="s2">microstates are readable in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.520" end="00:55:37.940" style="s2">configuration compared to the macro</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.230" end="00:55:40.550" style="s2">state so you can sort of see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.940" end="00:55:42.800" style="s2">infinitesimal you can see quad attorney</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.550" end="00:55:45.100" style="s2">on do you sort of see complex numbers is</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.800" end="00:55:47.210" style="s2">different dimensions of storing</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.100" end="00:55:49.310" style="s2">functional maneuvers within the real</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.210" end="00:55:50.810" style="s2">number line so you can sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.310" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">functions and numbers like controlling</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.810" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">it that way and so you could sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:55:59.000" style="s2">also then come to the conclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:56:00.980" style="s2">seeing thermodynamic entropy as a</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.000" end="00:56:05.390" style="s2">specific class of information entropy</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.980" end="00:56:09.800" style="s2">and that then becomes really a way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.390" end="00:56:12.440" style="s2">understanding entropy as a function of</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.800" end="00:56:16.280" style="s2">measurement you&#39;re getting in the Planck</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.440" end="00:56:19.010" style="s2">time so yeah so then then so then I was</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.280" end="00:56:21.050" style="s2">just wondering do you think time is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.010" end="00:56:24.260" style="s2">artifact of how we process information</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.050" end="00:56:26.540" style="s2">and how we measure things because no</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.260" end="00:56:28.580" style="s2">point is there a true zero like with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.540" end="00:56:32.200" style="s2">Eakins cut you can sort of put zero in</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.580" end="00:56:32.200" style="s2">any particular position</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.880" end="00:56:40.060" style="s2">the point sort of then can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.390" end="00:56:42.100" style="s2">branch out and become you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.060" end="00:56:44.530" style="s2">logarithmic route for example which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.100" end="00:56:46.540" style="s2">why numbers on the Riemann zeta-function</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.530" end="00:56:48.250" style="s2">can have some predictability as to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.540" end="00:56:53.710" style="s2">what&#39;s not prime because you know Q and</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.250" end="00:56:55.210" style="s2">a 2 n plus 1 and 2 n plus 3 okay so for</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.710" end="00:56:57.880" style="s2">I&#39;m going to deal with the one statement</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.210" end="00:57:07.420" style="s2">where information entropy is a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.880" end="00:57:10.630" style="s2">classic entropy entropy the bridge is</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.420" end="00:57:11.710" style="s2">tougher than I think there because the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.630" end="00:57:13.450" style="s2">most obvious bridge is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.710" end="00:57:15.750" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s demon that&#39;s probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.450" end="00:57:18.430" style="s2">obvious bridge how you can get from</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.750" end="00:57:20.200" style="s2">chemical entropy to information in</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.430" end="00:57:24.010" style="s2">Maxwell&#39;s Dean that is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.200" end="00:57:27.450" style="s2">bridge for that and for those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.010" end="00:57:30.610" style="s2">know Maxwell&#39;s demon it&#39;s the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.450" end="00:57:32.380" style="s2">basically break the thermo break the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.610" end="00:57:34.390" style="s2">balance of a system to get more energy</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.380" end="00:57:37.090" style="s2">than you thought possible that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.390" end="00:57:38.590" style="s2">simplified way of putting it but there</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.090" end="00:57:40.300" style="s2">are ways to do it in an information</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.590" end="00:57:42.670" style="s2">space but it&#39;s still energetically</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.300" end="00:57:44.020" style="s2">expensive so it&#39;s still the questions</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.670" end="00:57:48.540" style="s2">kind of out whether you can do that or</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.020" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">not so because information entropy is</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.540" end="00:57:58.110" style="s2">measuring surprisal versus equilibrium I</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:58:01.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s important to say is there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.110" end="00:58:03.660" style="s2">surprisal itself in equilibrium is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.030" end="00:58:06.460" style="s2">question you probably want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.660" end="00:58:07.900" style="s2">excuse me because because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.460" end="00:58:09.790" style="s2">information entropy the biddin the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.900" end="00:58:12.040" style="s2">flipping of the coin that yes or no or</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.790" end="00:58:15.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a human of surprising because you</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.040" end="00:58:17.050" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the thing&#39;s gonna do so</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.010" end="00:58:20.140" style="s2">in from a lot of information entropy is</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.050" end="00:58:22.900" style="s2">derivative of that construct the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.140" end="00:58:24.460" style="s2">is a bit of a challenge I haven&#39;t done a</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.900" end="00:58:25.870" style="s2">lot of effort on that but I know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.460" end="00:58:28.300" style="s2">Hawking had done some effort on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.870" end="00:58:31.360" style="s2">regarding black hole atrophy Blackall</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.300" end="00:58:33.220" style="s2">thermodynamics and that&#39;s that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.360" end="00:58:35.590" style="s2">the bridge he found was the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.220" end="00:58:37.330" style="s2">information is included in the black</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.590" end="00:58:39.430" style="s2">hole and therefore you can use that</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.330" end="00:58:41.190" style="s2">functional process to then make the</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.430" end="00:58:47.030" style="s2">bridge to traditional thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.190" end="00:58:53.360" style="s2">right so is it a class</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.030" end="00:58:55.550" style="s2">yes I think maybe you are you familiar</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.360" end="00:58:59.420" style="s2">with Edward Schrodinger&#39;s book what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.550" end="00:59:04.010" style="s2">life I&#39;m not so I think you need sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.420" end="00:59:06.350" style="s2">negentropy as as the understanding of so</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.010" end="00:59:08.450" style="s2">so you can sort of see negentropy as his</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.350" end="00:59:11.450" style="s2">explanation for why things are alive and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.450" end="00:59:14.090" style="s2">so you have the structure of matter that</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.450" end="00:59:15.650" style="s2">uses that can be configured in such a</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.090" end="00:59:19.070" style="s2">way as to limit degrees of freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.650" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">end of energy and that processing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.070" end="00:59:23.590" style="s2">direction of matter creates a</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:26.300" style="s2">constriction that is available for work</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.590" end="00:59:27.830" style="s2">si and so that&#39;s that&#39;s his concept of</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.300" end="00:59:30.560" style="s2">negentropy so that&#39;s how he explains</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.830" end="00:59:33.380" style="s2">life so you can sort of see the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.560" end="00:59:35.870" style="s2">pulses of a submarine underwater as sort</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.380" end="00:59:38.540" style="s2">of like it&#39;s it&#39;s the way it processes</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.870" end="00:59:42.650" style="s2">energy in a rhythmic way that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.540" end="00:59:48.100" style="s2">predictable make during the regarding</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.650" end="00:59:51.260" style="s2">how all this affects time yeah so like</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.100" end="00:59:52.970" style="s2">so with with information entropy you</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.260" end="00:59:54.470" style="s2">need a reader like you need something</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.970" end="00:59:59.030" style="s2">that is able to sort of read the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.470" end="01:00:01.910" style="s2">difference hmm and so you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.030" end="01:00:04.850" style="s2">some basis for that reading so that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.910" end="01:00:09.650" style="s2">basis then sort of becomes zero so with</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.850" end="01:00:11.540" style="s2">entropy you know things have you seen it</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.650" end="01:00:13.850" style="s2">can as a scenario where information</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.540" end="01:00:19.850" style="s2">entropy is reversible is there a time</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.850" end="01:00:23.900" style="s2">asymmetry there - yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.850" end="01:00:25.690" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really possible I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.900" end="01:00:28.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s because we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.690" end="01:00:30.620" style="s2">you can&#39;t really because negative</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.250" end="01:00:31.790" style="s2">numbers are sort of imaginary they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.620" end="01:00:35.240" style="s2">sort of just a projection</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.790" end="01:00:38.120" style="s2">oh I sort of get to that we sort of have</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.240" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">to start at a different basis maybe so</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.120" end="01:00:41.810" style="s2">each basis that we start at is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:46.220" style="s2">like what we&#39;ve considered to be like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.810" end="01:00:49.670" style="s2">container for the microstate and so it</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.220" end="01:00:55.370" style="s2">it becomes statistical right I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.670" end="01:00:57.680" style="s2">sorting that because we&#39;re saying about</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.370" end="01:00:59.000" style="s2">the stock market but it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.680" end="01:01:00.590" style="s2">something that can be predicted through</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.000" end="01:01:02.600" style="s2">probability but</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.590" end="01:01:05.270" style="s2">it you know you just you just have too</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.600" end="01:01:07.430" style="s2">much too much information like how long</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.270" end="01:01:09.620" style="s2">of a stock market run you need in order</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.430" end="01:01:13.120" style="s2">for a bit for it to start repeating is</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.620" end="01:01:16.550" style="s2">it election years or whatever and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.120" end="01:01:18.830" style="s2">le le Chi I don&#39;t know how to say his</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.550" end="01:01:21.260" style="s2">name but he&#39;s saying no it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.830" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">different sort of ontology it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.260" end="01:01:24.140" style="s2">different kind of metaphysics so when</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">you put it in the container of</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.140" end="01:01:29.420" style="s2">probability you sort of you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:30.920" style="s2">constraint like how you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.420" end="01:01:32.690" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.920" end="01:01:35.150" style="s2">for you to predict the stock market you</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.690" end="01:01:37.190" style="s2">have to sort of consider the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.150" end="01:01:40.970" style="s2">relationships from the present and not</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.190" end="01:01:42.350" style="s2">use the past or the future so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.970" end="01:01:43.940" style="s2">one scenario there&#39;s one thought</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.350" end="01:01:45.290" style="s2">experiment that comes to mind about this</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.940" end="01:01:47.320" style="s2">because when you talk an information</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.290" end="01:01:50.360" style="s2">entropy everything&#39;s discrete</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.320" end="01:01:52.490" style="s2">infinitesimals emerge as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.360" end="01:01:56.140" style="s2">statistics in that type of space they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.490" end="01:01:59.000" style="s2">not in Trinity</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.140" end="01:02:02.000" style="s2">you start getting too high clock rates</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.000" end="01:02:05.120" style="s2">so for example as as our clock rate</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:11.210" style="s2">becomes infinitesimally you have imagine</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.120" end="01:02:13.730" style="s2">flash light bulb over it over t1 it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.210" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">and then four point one it&#39;s off in that</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.730" end="01:02:17.240" style="s2">four point zero one it&#39;s on that four</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:19.820" style="s2">point zero zero one it&#39;s off so as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.240" end="01:02:23.030" style="s2">see as we get closer to zero the light</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.820" end="01:02:25.190" style="s2">bulb is flashing it&#39;s it&#39;s as if it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.030" end="01:02:27.230" style="s2">and off at the same time when depending</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.190" end="01:02:29.690" style="s2">upon what resolution you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.230" end="01:02:31.490" style="s2">if you if you&#39;re way off it looks like</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.690" end="01:02:32.930" style="s2">it&#39;s always on but there for example</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.490" end="01:02:35.390" style="s2">there&#39;s one technology that does that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.930" end="01:02:37.340" style="s2">it&#39;s able to transfer binary technology</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.390" end="01:02:39.590" style="s2">through differential shades the way of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.340" end="01:02:41.120" style="s2">amplitude of its light so the lights in</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.590" end="01:02:43.600" style="s2">your house actually become Wi-Fi</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.120" end="01:02:49.340" style="s2">transmitters not by using that technique</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.600" end="01:02:52.070" style="s2">so the question is resolution of your</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.340" end="01:02:53.450" style="s2">clock mm-hmm and that&#39;s where you start</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.070" end="01:02:55.730" style="s2">to get the infinitesimal problem all</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.450" end="01:02:58.700" style="s2">over again it&#39;s an even information</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.730" end="01:03:03.200" style="s2">entropy you can still get them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.700" end="01:03:06.380" style="s2">still still bound the time yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:08.210" style="s2">I don&#39;t quite see that the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.380" end="01:03:12.530" style="s2">of the intrud Testament of time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.210" end="01:03:14.490" style="s2">kind of seems like oh I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.530" end="01:03:16.560" style="s2">definitely time in entropy</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.490" end="01:03:18.420" style="s2">and it would be you sort of have you</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.560" end="01:03:20.550" style="s2">need them the microstates sort of to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.420" end="01:03:23.490" style="s2">in a configuration that&#39;s not readable</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.550" end="01:03:26.460" style="s2">and so I can see the connection there</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.490" end="01:03:30.360" style="s2">with entropy only fantastical as being</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.460" end="01:03:31.740" style="s2">those particular microstates yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.360" end="01:03:32.910" style="s2">dealing with discrete time when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.740" end="01:03:37.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about information</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.910" end="01:03:38.580" style="s2">entropy and so what I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.260" end="01:03:39.750" style="s2">not the discreteness at the time that</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.580" end="01:03:42.450" style="s2">matters it&#39;s a resolution will be</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.750" end="01:03:48.090" style="s2">observer that&#39;s interesting because it</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.450" end="01:03:50.220" style="s2">connects to to Elaine Meadows cheek that</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.090" end="01:03:53.160" style="s2">limit Cardinals are a different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.220" end="01:03:56.520" style="s2">ontology when you jump from real numbers</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.160" end="01:03:57.600" style="s2">to the Cardinals or Arnall numbers or</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.520" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">you go the other direction towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.600" end="01:04:01.950" style="s2">infinitesimal a little smaller so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:03.480" style="s2">like a different isn&#39;t it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.950" end="01:04:05.550" style="s2">different dimension of interaction and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.480" end="01:04:07.680" style="s2">the logic that is that each level is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.550" end="01:04:09.360" style="s2">different and so the formation of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.680" end="01:04:11.850" style="s2">new logic that it appears is what we</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.360" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">call the advance interesting what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.850" end="01:04:30.090" style="s2">called I&#39;m going to take that one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:33.690" style="s2">a good one yeah being in time after this</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.090" end="01:04:35.460" style="s2">beat I&#39;m gonna give it to David sweat</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.690" end="01:04:37.050" style="s2">low who seemed to be tracking this</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.460" end="01:04:38.660" style="s2">conversation before it happened in the</p>

<p begin="01:04:44.730" end="01:04:47.180" style="s2">in private you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.020" end="01:04:56.580" style="s2">so actually Nicholas was saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.120" end="01:04:59.040" style="s2">something similar so the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.580" end="01:05:01.830" style="s2">questions is Donald Hoffman&#39;s idea in</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.040" end="01:05:04.350" style="s2">the case against reality the notion that</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.830" end="01:05:05.460" style="s2">space-time is really just a data</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.350" end="01:05:07.740" style="s2">structure and that we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.460" end="01:05:10.010" style="s2">perceive reality as it is but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.740" end="01:05:12.570" style="s2">something in that if I think about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.010" end="01:05:16.440" style="s2">correctly then something like negative</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.570" end="01:05:18.750" style="s2">II is possible due to a living thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.440" end="01:05:22.110" style="s2">doing a super task effectively the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.750" end="01:05:23.940" style="s2">infant estable is something that is we</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.110" end="01:05:25.110" style="s2">we experience it even though it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.940" end="01:05:26.550" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not alive in space-time</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.110" end="01:05:28.560" style="s2">it&#39;s something it&#39;s not alive in the</p>

<p begin="01:05:28.560" end="01:05:32.910" style="s2">it is alive in some real way and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.390" end="01:05:35.940" style="s2">something like tracking Maxwell&#39;s demon</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.910" end="01:05:38.340" style="s2">as the addition of that&#39;s impossible and</p>

<p begin="01:05:53.550" end="01:05:59.670" style="s2">actually allows for something like a</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.839" end="01:07:23.640" style="s2">concept of space so that would be a</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.089" end="01:07:28.950" style="s2">benefit I think putting it putting our</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.640" end="01:07:31.650" style="s2">infant s amol of time instead of as a a</p>

<p begin="01:07:34.530" end="01:07:39.539" style="s2">structure might be beneficial and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.530" end="01:07:41.640" style="s2">seen some clever stuff talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.539" end="01:07:46.440" style="s2">that exact process you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.640" end="01:07:50.750" style="s2">them there&#39;s it&#39;s a transactional tan it</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.440" end="01:07:50.750" style="s2">was a called transactional want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.349" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">trigger the next phase but it was anyway</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.039" end="01:08:15.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll get it to you later the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.440" style="s2">that if if the Maxwell&#39;s demon is there</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.930" end="01:08:21.089" style="s2">doing stuff and things are reversible</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.440" end="01:08:23.190" style="s2">this particular theory was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.089" end="01:08:25.710" style="s2">describe the blending of the future in</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.190" end="01:08:27.960" style="s2">the now as a transactional process so</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.710" end="01:08:29.370" style="s2">where it&#39;s going back and forth so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.960" end="01:08:32.250" style="s2">doing exactly that technique you were</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.370" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">describing so the the amplitude comes in</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.250" end="01:08:36.839" style="s2">from one photon it comes from the past</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:38.069" style="s2">it then hits this feature photon and</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.839" end="01:08:40.259" style="s2">then what it will do is it will</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.069" end="01:08:43.170" style="s2">negotiate like a handshake like a tcp/ip</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.259" end="01:08:44.969" style="s2">I I got a tcp/ip packet and I will say</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.170" end="01:08:46.949" style="s2">hey you want this you want this quantity</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.969" end="01:08:48.210" style="s2">and the other one says sure I&#39;ll take it</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.949" end="01:08:50.100" style="s2">and all the other ones say no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.210" end="01:08:52.080" style="s2">want to take it so result that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.100" end="01:08:53.850" style="s2">wavefunction collapsing it then takes</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.080" end="01:08:55.199" style="s2">the quantity and then the energy</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.850" end="01:08:57.350" style="s2">transfer happens so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.199" end="01:09:02.190" style="s2">decision-making process being done in</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.350" end="01:09:03.660" style="s2">this theory of time collapsing so what</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.190" end="01:09:05.730" style="s2">it&#39;s taking it&#39;s taking the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.660" end="01:09:07.080" style="s2">infinitesimal that&#39;s it&#39;s all floating</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.730" end="01:09:10.020" style="s2">it to the decision making process</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.080" end="01:09:11.009" style="s2">instead so that I have seen something</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.020" end="01:09:12.600" style="s2">that does what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.009" end="01:09:17.000" style="s2">we&#39;re what we called Maxwell&#39;s demon</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.600" end="01:09:17.000" style="s2">there is something that does</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.299" end="01:09:22.589" style="s2">Nick I&#39;m gonna give you the last word is</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.339" end="01:09:30.389" style="s2">there anything more you want to add with</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.589" end="01:09:32.520" style="s2">your last comment Thank You Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.389" end="01:09:34.679" style="s2">so yeah I know justjust on the same</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.520" end="01:09:36.690" style="s2">topic of Donnell Hoffman&#39;s into</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.679" end="01:09:40.500" style="s2">interface theory of perception I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.690" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">actually not quite sure where this this</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.500" end="01:09:45.809" style="s2">talk of Maxwell&#39;s demon fits and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.159" end="01:09:47.369" style="s2">possibility or impossibility of</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.809" end="01:09:50.579" style="s2">negentropy if we assume that</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.369" end="01:09:52.469" style="s2">consciousness gives rise to a user</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.579" end="01:09:55.610" style="s2">interface that is comprised of</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.770" end="01:10:07.650" style="s2">more I just want to throw that out there</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.540" end="01:10:11.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.650" end="01:10:14.460" style="s2">black bacteria and if you know that if</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.130" end="01:10:18.380" style="s2">there&#39;s an impact of infinitesimals on</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.460" end="01:10:18.380" style="s2">that are you talking</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.409" end="01:10:25.579" style="s2">correct I see well in that case I go</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.290" end="01:10:30.119" style="s2">back to the same person who criticized</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.579" end="01:10:32.639" style="s2">Newton about infant testicles and this</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.119" end="01:10:34.949" style="s2">is actually poetic I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.639" end="01:10:38.820" style="s2">read the bishops actual words in his</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.949" end="01:10:41.400" style="s2">criticism of you there once there was</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.820" end="01:10:44.130" style="s2">it&#39;s in the form of a limerick there was</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.400" end="01:10:47.040" style="s2">a young man who said God must fight it</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.130" end="01:10:50.040" style="s2">exceedingly odd to think that the tree</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.040" end="01:10:54.929" style="s2">should continue to be and there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.040" end="01:10:57.840" style="s2">about in the quod he reply dear sir your</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.929" end="01:11:00.420" style="s2">astonishment odd I am always about in</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.840" end="01:11:03.829" style="s2">the quad and that&#39;s why the tree will</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.420" end="01:11:07.590" style="s2">continue to be sincerely observed by God</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.829" end="01:11:10.050" style="s2">so it&#39;s very us we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone full</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.590" end="01:11:18.809" style="s2">circle to exactly what the criticism of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.050" end="01:11:22.590" style="s2">Newton was and and you just what a great</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.809" end="01:11:24.900" style="s2">aesthetic ending thank you so much Pat</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.590" end="01:11:27.719" style="s2">and thank you everybody who joined in</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.900" end="01:11:30.210" style="s2">for that ride I&#39;m gonna hand it over to</p>

<p begin="01:12:08.520" end="01:12:13.710" style="s2">how to mediate the culture war it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.520" end="01:12:17.219" style="s2">very very interesting or the liminal war</p>
