<p begin="00:00:03.030" end="00:00:09.929" style="s2">I am so nice to have this opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.839" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">do this interview with you we met um I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.929" end="00:00:15.809" style="s2">can&#39;t remember was it in 2009 that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:18.390" style="s2">came oh I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:22.199" style="s2">I&#39;m too old to remember those things but</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.390" end="00:00:23.789" style="s2">it was a horn yeah remember that first</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.199" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">you came to Finland and then I also</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.789" end="00:00:29.880" style="s2">always remember when I went to see is we</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:34.070" style="s2">went to the National History Museum</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.880" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">which I loved and still have the t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.070" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">great yeah no I remember that because I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:41.910" style="s2">pulled out into the traffic going the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">wrong way I think I scared your pants</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">off you the policeman pulled up but you</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">see brother nervous I said no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:55.850" style="s2">cool sure enough he got out held up the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:01:00.649" style="s2">traffic so we could turn around and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.850" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">would love to because for so long um</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.649" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">this word I did more and more people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">using the word consciousness every day</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.659" style="s2">now and saying that ultimately the shift</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">we now need to make is so deep in terms</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.659" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">of redesigning as David all would call</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">it redesigning the human presence on</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">earth and within the lifetime of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:24.869" style="s2">generations life today</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">and that&#39;s a tall order and and most of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.869" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">them are in intelligent perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">that I read on this all agreed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">ultimately we need a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">consciousness before we have a chance of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">redesigning because it&#39;s ultimately in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:45.990" style="s2">the way we see the world the way we see</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:47.549" style="s2">ourselves and the way we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.990" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">relationship between consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.549" end="00:01:51.240" style="s2">matter it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">so much of the problems that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.240" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">created actually rooted and it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">those words that lots of people use but</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.220" style="s2">you wrote a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:08.959" style="s2">called consciousness explained better</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.220" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">short little book it was a take on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.959" end="00:02:15.690" style="s2">Daniel Dennett Daniel did is explained</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">or some people say should have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.690" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">consciousness explained away because you</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:25.050" style="s2">know he&#39;s such a reductionist in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:31.370" style="s2">ISA physicalist I would say he&#39;s proud</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.050" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">of it so yeah what I one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.370" end="00:02:36.120" style="s2">statements about consciousness that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">read is from an article that you call</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">authored with Ken Wilber in 2010 and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">just gonna read this statement here and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:46.019" style="s2">it&#39;s consciousness is so much more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">an evolutionary accident or an</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.019" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">epiphenomenon of biochemical processes</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:54.330" style="s2">in our heads consciousness is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">fundamentally woven into the universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.330" end="00:02:59.730" style="s2">itself what we are saying is that what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">we are saying is that to some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.730" end="00:03:04.860" style="s2">subjectivity is indeed present in all</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">the way all the way up and all the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.860" end="00:03:09.079" style="s2">down in the evolutionary ladder from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">tiniest quarks to the biggest brains</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.079" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">this consciousness can be loosely</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:16.980" style="s2">described as a perspective making and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">perspective-taking system that creates</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.980" end="00:03:23.459" style="s2">collects organizes deeper wider and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">sophisticated sophisticated points of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.459" end="00:03:28.079" style="s2">view as it develops</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">so it&#39;s an evolutionary developmental</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.079" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">view that starts with then basically any</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:42.510" style="s2">perspective taking is an act of bringing</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:46.380" style="s2">forth a world and we bring the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.510" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">together in that jewel of Indra from all</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.380" end="00:03:51.570" style="s2">those perspectives whether there he is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:53.670" style="s2">taking or whether it&#39;s a sequoia tree</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.570" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">taking perspective of its environment am</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.670" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">i understanding that correctly or could</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">you elaborate on that by the way I love</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:07.799" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s at maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:13.349" style="s2">you could send it to me I I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.799" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">remember where it&#39;s at but or writing it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.349" end="00:04:17.760" style="s2">but sounds right</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:23.610" style="s2">I find this I think it wasn&#39;t one of Ken</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:29.940" style="s2">Wilbur&#39;s websites an article no but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.610" end="00:04:32.460" style="s2">a great quote well it brings up several</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.940" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">points that we could talk about quite a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.460" end="00:04:40.199" style="s2">bit sort of prefigures a what today</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:43.020" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing more and more philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.199" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">and scientists shifting to a kind of pan</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.020" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">psychist view and psychism that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">consciousness is somehow fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">the to the world and to the universe</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.910" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">Christian De Quincey wrote a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:03.419" style="s2">book about this years ago that urban</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.910" style="s2">Laughlin was so impressed whether he had</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.419" end="00:05:08.039" style="s2">a whole conference based on it I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.910" end="00:05:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s called radical knowing but if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.039" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">go to Christian De Quincey he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.280" end="00:05:16.860" style="s2">an independent scholar on the west coast</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:18.539" style="s2">he has his own website and he teaches</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.860" end="00:05:23.430" style="s2">courses but he&#39;s written several books</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.539" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">but this was his first one and which he</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.430" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">makes a good case for the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:34.729" style="s2">consciousness is interwoven I shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:41.849" style="s2">say it it&#39;s a feature of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.729" end="00:05:44.370" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not exactly panned psychism</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.849" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">but pretty close to it and he makes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.370" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">good good case for that the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">pants ideas and the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:06:00.510" style="s2">consciousness permeates everything in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:04.139" style="s2">some sense or other see I&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.510" end="00:06:06.090" style="s2">to the big meeting at Tucson in a month</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.139" end="00:06:08.520" style="s2">or two that this is the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.090" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">conference conference in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.520" end="00:06:14.970" style="s2">it meets in Tucson every other year</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:16.830" style="s2">which is its home base but the next year</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.970" end="00:06:19.440" style="s2">it will be in Italy for example last</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.830" end="00:06:21.900" style="s2">year was in Switzerland so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:26.750" style="s2">different places but I have been coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.900" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">since the beginning 26 or 27 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.750" end="00:06:31.030" style="s2">they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:35.970" style="s2">and it&#39;s directed by Stuart Hameroff</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.030" end="00:06:39.630" style="s2">who&#39;s probably the most prominent</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.970" end="00:06:42.520" style="s2">scientists in the world who argues for</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.630" end="00:06:45.789" style="s2">quantum events in the brain it&#39;s a root</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">of consciousness and and he works at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.789" end="00:06:52.330" style="s2">University of Tucson or Arizona there</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:53.860" style="s2">he&#39;s a geologist by trade but he&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.330" end="00:06:55.690" style="s2">of these very bright guys I think his</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.860" end="00:06:58.690" style="s2">first book years ago was on quantum</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.690" end="00:07:01.659" style="s2">computing and he got together with David</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.690" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">Chalmers it was at the time 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.659" end="00:07:08.650" style="s2">twenty seven years ago a young</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:11.370" style="s2">philosopher and the two of them began to</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.650" end="00:07:14.009" style="s2">organize these conferences well Chalmers</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.370" end="00:07:18.069" style="s2">first argued that consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.009" end="00:07:19.990" style="s2">information and yes if its earliest</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.069" end="00:07:22.300" style="s2">books a very good book on consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.990" end="00:07:24.610" style="s2">although he made price argue for this</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.300" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">theory of consciousness is information I</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.610" end="00:07:30.610" style="s2">wish could be right or could be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">but the point is that he and the last</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.610" end="00:07:36.030" style="s2">year for unities become apparent</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:39.930" style="s2">psychist and so when people of his</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.030" end="00:07:42.370" style="s2">recognition and caliber in the academy</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.930" end="00:07:44.320" style="s2">become pants I mean this is a guy that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.370" end="00:07:47.650" style="s2">hangs out with Daniel Dennett for</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.320" end="00:07:50.050" style="s2">example it and with the elite what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.650" end="00:07:53.020" style="s2">would call northeastern school of</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.050" end="00:07:56.710" style="s2">philosophers who are very distant very</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.020" end="00:07:58.780" style="s2">arrogant in their own way and very elite</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.710" end="00:08:01.990" style="s2">and here he is somehow he&#39;s gotten in</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.990" end="00:08:26.380" style="s2">always felt that consciousness is shared</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.830" end="00:08:37.810" style="s2">that maybe it goes down deeper than that</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.329" end="00:08:51.100" style="s2">describe but what I find interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.149" end="00:08:53.140" style="s2">that like yet yesterday I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.100" end="00:08:54.670" style="s2">Fritjof Capra and and we were spending</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.140" end="00:08:57.430" style="s2">it spent quite some time talking about</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.430" end="00:09:02.470" style="s2">also talked about the question what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.430" end="00:09:04.750" style="s2">life and for me it seems like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.470" end="00:09:07.529" style="s2">question what is life and what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.750" end="00:09:10.930" style="s2">consciousness I actually very closely</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:32.709" style="s2">read by you and Ken M because it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:36.579" style="s2">about that it&#39;s the act of distinction</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.790" end="00:10:50.260" style="s2">this tape will be familiar with it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.949" end="00:10:53.410" style="s2">it&#39;s simply the idea that the organism</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.260" end="00:10:54.190" style="s2">the processes of the organism say a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.410" end="00:10:58.660" style="s2">single</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.660" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">creature that in some the output of the</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.500" end="00:11:22.510" style="s2">in the next moment I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.890" end="00:11:26.410" style="s2">basic and important idea I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.510" end="00:11:28.270" style="s2">that no criticism intended but I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.410" end="00:11:35.890" style="s2">never impressed with the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.270" end="00:11:37.330" style="s2">inaction much and I I could say more but</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.890" end="00:11:41.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t know whether you want me to talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.330" end="00:11:43.810" style="s2">more about it well people get really</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.020" end="00:11:47.590" style="s2">excited about inaction and I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.810" end="00:11:50.350" style="s2">anything new in it frankly that Jerome</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.590" end="00:11:52.450" style="s2">Bruner wrote about the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.350" end="00:11:56.350" style="s2">inaction and cognitive systems and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.450" end="00:12:01.870" style="s2">learning back in the 60s John Dewey</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.350" end="00:12:03.730" style="s2">wrote about it in the 19th century the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.870" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">notion of bringing forth our worlds then</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.730" end="00:12:13.810" style="s2">we are well now wait a minute now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:15.430" style="s2">bringing forth a world that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.810" end="00:12:17.250" style="s2">would like you to just define what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.430" end="00:12:23.140" style="s2">mean by inaction so people understand</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.250" end="00:12:24.700" style="s2">well it&#39;s just that the organism is in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.140" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">very active relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.700" end="00:12:30.310" style="s2">environment or with other organisms and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:35.050" style="s2">so there&#39;s this action going back and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:39.000" style="s2">forth and so you know as I said in John</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.050" end="00:12:46.060" style="s2">Dewey&#39;s and Jerome Bruner it&#39;s in Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.000" end="00:12:48.370" style="s2">it&#39;s got a new name but I&#39;m sorry I wish</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.060" end="00:12:53.589" style="s2">I could say I was excited about it but</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.370" end="00:12:54.820" style="s2">I&#39;m just not I think the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.589" end="00:12:59.380" style="s2">bringing forth the world is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.820" end="00:13:01.780" style="s2">interesting turn of phrase but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.380" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">think there&#39;s any news in it basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.780" end="00:13:06.940" style="s2">went for a new Varela by the way but not</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.769" style="s2">real real well he was part of urban</p>

<p begin="00:13:07.769" end="00:13:12.660" style="s2">crippled an urban started writing about</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.509" end="00:13:14.850" style="s2">weird and wonderful things like life</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.660" end="00:13:19.290" style="s2">continuing after death he got off the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.850" end="00:13:22.139" style="s2">boat he was not hidden one part of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.290" end="00:13:26.579" style="s2">so but I did see him in a number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.139" end="00:13:29.759" style="s2">meetings so where was I with this I</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.579" end="00:13:32.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s a different way I mean okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.759" end="00:13:37.170" style="s2">open your eyes and look around the room</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.119" end="00:13:39.119" style="s2">now you&#39;ve created a world now what kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.170" end="00:13:42.779" style="s2">of the world in your own experience and</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.119" end="00:13:44.549" style="s2">you can interact with it I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.779" end="00:13:48.179" style="s2">anything more profound in it than that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.549" end="00:13:50.489" style="s2">but you have to remember that real is</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.179" end="00:13:52.410" style="s2">not your honest concept of an organism</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.489" end="00:13:58.199" style="s2">it&#39;s a very close or the thing is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.410" end="00:14:00.209" style="s2">metaphor at length of a submarine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.199" end="00:14:01.980" style="s2">like a submarine it&#39;s got this periscope</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.209" end="00:14:04.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.980" end="00:14:06.799" style="s2">periscope I used to argue all the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.679" end="00:14:11.610" style="s2">with my friend Soren Breyer who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.799" end="00:14:14.579" style="s2">eminent some at assist semiotic sister</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.610" end="00:14:17.220" style="s2">actually biosemiotics is he ran the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.579" end="00:14:20.490" style="s2">journal for years and he would always</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.220" end="00:14:22.319" style="s2">take their side I would say well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:25.829" style="s2">see I don&#39;t agree with this I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.319" end="00:14:27.509" style="s2">think an organism is a closed system and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.829" end="00:14:29.910" style="s2">someone would say what really means</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.509" end="00:14:32.569" style="s2">closed in terms of processes and so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.910" end="00:14:36.600" style="s2">would go back and forth but the s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.569" end="00:14:39.059" style="s2">important part or the way the thing came</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.600" end="00:14:42.269" style="s2">down for me is that an organism is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.059" end="00:14:44.699" style="s2">closed system that they use the mint or</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.269" end="00:14:47.389" style="s2">the submarine with the periscope and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.699" end="00:14:50.069" style="s2">then they could look out this periscope</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.389" end="00:14:52.439" style="s2">at a very limited world and then it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.069" end="00:14:53.819" style="s2">could connect with other organisms in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.439" end="00:14:57.779" style="s2">with the environment but it was a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.819" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">limited connection and just I never</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.779" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">could rush inside now maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:05.819" style="s2">smart enough I know a lot of smart</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:08.869" style="s2">people think about this but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.819" end="00:15:11.399" style="s2">organism is open in all kinds of ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.869" end="00:15:15.360" style="s2">ecologically opened it organically open</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.399" end="00:15:18.119" style="s2">and so on so I never I never got on</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:18.930" style="s2">board with that I mean I personally and</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.119" end="00:15:22.710" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.930" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">this is more of a intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.710" end="00:15:28.740" style="s2">understanding based on some study but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.450" style="s2">sense that we might actually have it</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.740" end="00:15:32.730" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.450" end="00:15:34.980" style="s2">focusing too much on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.730" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">organism or even the individual species</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.980" end="00:15:44.490" style="s2">and we um if we understood life as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.520" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">planetary process that is through this</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.490" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">act of perspective taking basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.209" style="s2">becoming conscious of itself more and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:53.100" style="s2">therefore getting better feedback on how</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.209" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">to organize the complexity that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.100" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">creates in order to be better at</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">you wanna can frame it under Janine</p>

<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:07.980" style="s2">what life does it creates conditions</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.070" end="00:16:14.760" style="s2">conducive to life and for me this on the</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.820" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">for me that the big shift is to stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.590" end="00:18:03.610" style="s2">because we now everybody talks about</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.610" end="00:18:13.000" style="s2">survives and if we identify more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.409" end="00:18:17.880" style="s2">with life as a planetary process then</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.000" end="00:18:21.370" style="s2">our concern would be life continuing and</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.890" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">and and the to make that maturity jump</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.190" end="00:18:36.809" style="s2">that we now need to do as a species we</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:41.140" style="s2">need to reify with that wider process um</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.809" end="00:18:44.440" style="s2">just as like Goethe said um 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.140" end="00:18:46.600" style="s2">ago 250 years ago who doesn&#39;t see nature</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.110" end="00:19:11.049" style="s2">living whole yeah he reminds me of Walt</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:23.049" style="s2">was really a mystic in a lot of ways but</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.150" end="00:19:23.789" style="s2">yeah I like what you&#39;re saying there</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.049" end="00:19:26.299" style="s2">were two</p>

<p begin="00:19:35.970" end="00:19:43.710" style="s2">ending last year - they said he writes</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.409" end="00:19:46.200" style="s2">books every weekend I think and he can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.710" end="00:19:48.629" style="s2">hardly keep up with him he&#39;s 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.200" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">older than me I don&#39;t know how yes and I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.629" end="00:19:56.629" style="s2">hope I&#39;m half as smart as he is but he</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:20:01.139" style="s2">makes an amazingly intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.629" end="00:20:03.599" style="s2">well-thought-out argument that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.139" end="00:20:08.059" style="s2">cosmos as a whole is it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.599" end="00:20:11.220" style="s2">living process living organism really</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.059" end="00:20:14.879" style="s2">with checks and balances and growth</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.220" end="00:20:19.249" style="s2">processes and autopilot processes at</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.879" end="00:20:19.249" style="s2">every level and this is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.340" end="00:20:27.330" style="s2">drawing together of ideas that are out</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:31.200" style="s2">there have been out there but to think</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.330" end="00:20:34.820" style="s2">of the the whole universe as like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.200" end="00:20:36.779" style="s2">single organism in its levels of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.820" end="00:20:40.950" style="s2">organization and structure and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.779" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">communication within itself it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.950" end="00:20:44.429" style="s2">wonderful and he convinced me I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:45.749" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the most important things he</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.429" end="00:20:47.249" style="s2">ever did I think it&#39;s one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.749" end="00:20:49.109" style="s2">important books it&#39;s ever been written</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.249" end="00:20:52.440" style="s2">even though it&#39;s just some little book</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.109" end="00:20:55.320" style="s2">because it gives you a vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.440" end="00:21:00.299" style="s2">cosmos is a unified process and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.320" end="00:21:03.570" style="s2">process is growing I&#39;m not in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.299" end="00:21:07.379" style="s2">trivial sense but it&#39;s evolving its</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.570" end="00:21:09.029" style="s2">evolving at many levels all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.379" end="00:21:11.220" style="s2">it&#39;s and it&#39;s it&#39;s a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.029" end="00:21:14.039" style="s2">evolutionary perspective rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.220" end="00:21:17.249" style="s2">dead mechanical universe that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.039" end="00:21:18.809" style="s2">for so long and that led us astray in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.249" end="00:21:20.849" style="s2">how I mean this is what I mean when</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.809" end="00:21:23.580" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about bringing forth a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.849" end="00:21:27.419" style="s2">word I love Henry bought Earth&#39;s motion</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.580" end="00:21:30.179" style="s2">of organizing ideas with rule and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.419" end="00:21:32.999" style="s2">why I finally that&#39;s where we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.179" end="00:21:36.160" style="s2">shift to some extent needs to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.999" end="00:21:38.630" style="s2">we need new organizing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.160" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">allow us to for example think of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.630" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">universe as a living organism and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:45.980" style="s2">garden living yeah and this brings back</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.630" style="s2">another point I want to say before I</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.980" end="00:21:48.830" style="s2">forget because I&#39;m getting old and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.630" end="00:21:55.060" style="s2">forget what I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.830" end="00:21:57.710" style="s2">halftime act I mean if just forgotten it</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.060" end="00:22:02.780" style="s2">just to prove you where are worried a</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.710" end="00:22:05.270" style="s2">minute ago okay I remember you said</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.780" end="00:22:07.580" style="s2">we&#39;re fighting climate change thought</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.270" end="00:22:09.560" style="s2">about Friday you know that especially I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.580" end="00:22:11.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know about your panamerican this</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.560" end="00:22:12.650" style="s2">is that a real problem and everything we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.210" end="00:22:15.800" style="s2">don&#39;t like we&#39;re gonna fight we fight</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.650" end="00:22:18.350" style="s2">diseases and fight old age gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.800" end="00:22:23.060" style="s2">battle against poverty and a fight</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.350" end="00:22:25.970" style="s2">poverty you know if it&#39;s such a poor way</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.060" end="00:22:28.040" style="s2">to go about solving a problem exactly</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.970" end="00:22:32.390" style="s2">so you know we&#39;re not gonna fight the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.040" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">environment what we got to do is get on</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.390" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">board and do what we can do to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:43.970" style="s2">facilitate a natural process that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:45.800" style="s2">another way of saying hey I quoted these</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.970" end="00:22:47.390" style="s2">people not by agreeing with them because</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.800" end="00:22:50.540" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s exactly the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.390" end="00:22:54.740" style="s2">organizing ideas yet and other it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.540" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">also it starts from a problem rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.740" end="00:22:59.900" style="s2">than the potential and I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.970" style="s2">we really go looking with consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.900" end="00:23:04.730" style="s2">then what we what we need to start from</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.970" end="00:23:08.210" style="s2">is working from potential flow from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.730" end="00:23:11.930" style="s2">the potential of us waking up to our</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.210" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">core identity with this larger evolving</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.930" end="00:23:16.670" style="s2">process whether we keep it for a while I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:19.760" style="s2">think we&#39;d already have a massive</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.670" end="00:23:22.250" style="s2">achievement if people understood their</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.760" end="00:23:24.440" style="s2">unity with Gaia as a living planet at</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.250" end="00:23:27.260" style="s2">the planetary scale but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.440" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">what you just I haven&#39;t read Evans</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.260" end="00:23:32.180" style="s2">latest book but the notion of speaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:34.430" style="s2">of the entire universe as an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.180" end="00:23:42.650" style="s2">organism makes complete sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.430" end="00:23:45.020" style="s2">because it other people I have a at</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.650" end="00:23:48.260" style="s2">least a pre-publication copy of it so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.020" end="00:23:48.920" style="s2">don&#39;t just shout you&#39;re right well let</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.260" end="00:23:52.190" style="s2">me come in</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.920" end="00:23:54.380" style="s2">on this a little bit it&#39;s a person</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.190" end="00:23:57.530" style="s2">that&#39;s been as you know and very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.380" end="00:23:58.460" style="s2">involved in the consciousness field the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.530" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.460" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">area and I often hear that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:11.350" style="s2">and this is what urban is all about we</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.510" end="00:24:14.230" style="s2">need to change our consciousness our</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.350" end="00:24:18.680" style="s2">knits he writes about it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.230" end="00:24:20.660" style="s2">but it&#39;s I think it&#39;s I hate to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.680" end="00:24:24.200" style="s2">not that simple but it&#39;s not that simple</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.200" end="00:24:31.190" style="s2">developmentalists so I&#39;m like ken wilber</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:34.730" style="s2">yeah ok and now if we were all like you</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.190" end="00:24:36.470" style="s2">know Goethe or Walt Whitman we would</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.730" end="00:24:40.610" style="s2">change our consciousness to already be</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.470" end="00:24:42.950" style="s2">change but so if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.610" end="00:24:46.430" style="s2">developmental stages and see I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.950" end="00:24:48.710" style="s2">psychologist by training and most of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.430" end="00:24:51.160" style="s2">work is really psychology and Wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.710" end="00:24:53.150" style="s2">really has kind of become a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.160" end="00:24:55.250" style="s2">and he does a very good job with</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.150" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">disappointing out that what&#39;s the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">perspective at each developmental stage</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:05.780" style="s2">we identify with our with our own family</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:08.210" style="s2">then we had then as we grow we identify</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.780" end="00:25:10.520" style="s2">with our social group or church whatever</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.210" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">community and then as we grow we</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.520" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">identify with her maybe our nation and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:19.210" style="s2">then eventually we can identify with our</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.650" style="s2">own species</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.210" end="00:25:23.450" style="s2">but you&#39;ve got to practically be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.650" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">Buddhist Saint before you can identify</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.450" end="00:25:28.310" style="s2">with all life and that&#39;s not really the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">end of it you want to identify with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.310" end="00:25:35.250" style="s2">whole cosmos so we don&#39;t have the time</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:38.630" style="s2">or the means or the likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.250" end="00:25:42.030" style="s2">this is a realistic side of it for me of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.630" end="00:25:44.850" style="s2">promoting and facilitating that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.030" end="00:25:49.110" style="s2">growth in large numbers of people would</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.850" end="00:25:53.190" style="s2">like to but it&#39;s just not realistic what</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.110" end="00:25:58.230" style="s2">is realistic is finding at each level</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.190" end="00:26:03.049" style="s2">what is needed to facilitate things at</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.230" end="00:26:05.880" style="s2">all levels or at higher levels that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.049" end="00:26:07.250" style="s2">Kim rubbers written about this quite a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.880" end="00:26:08.970" style="s2">bit he calls it the</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.970" end="00:26:13.700" style="s2">scale wizard or the growth was if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.389" end="00:26:16.979" style="s2">want to talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.700" end="00:26:18.869" style="s2">for example Republicans in the US you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.979" end="00:26:21.710" style="s2">got to talk to them about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.869" end="00:26:24.509" style="s2">interested in yeah their own security</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.710" end="00:26:26.220" style="s2">the security of their children the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.509" end="00:26:29.029" style="s2">future of their children I think most of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.220" end="00:26:33.090" style="s2">them are trying to be interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.029" end="00:26:34.919" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to find leverage points that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.090" end="00:26:37.109" style="s2">are different for different</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.919" end="00:26:39.299" style="s2">developmental levels and what people</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.109" end="00:26:41.399" style="s2">want what they need it&#39;s insoluble so</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.299" end="00:26:43.710" style="s2">that&#39;s I mean it&#39;s not general</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.399" end="00:26:47.690" style="s2">philosophy that&#39;s not and I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.710" end="00:26:51.149" style="s2">with urban I&#39;m not gonna pop the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.690" end="00:26:53.879" style="s2">exactly I thank you for speaking to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.149" end="00:26:57.869" style="s2">because that&#39;s where I was going and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.879" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">I find I mean urban is one of the people</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.869" end="00:27:04.859" style="s2">who really have promoted this paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">shift story and I I find that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.859" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">deep wisdom in the fact that when</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:13.799" style="s2">Donella Meadows wrote her paper places</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:15.690" style="s2">to intervene in a system there was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.799" end="00:27:17.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a first version and a second</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.690" end="00:27:19.470" style="s2">version of that paper in the first</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.099" end="00:27:21.299" style="s2">version she ends at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.470" end="00:27:24.299" style="s2">paradigm she says that&#39;s the highest</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.299" end="00:27:26.190" style="s2">leverage point and then she 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.299" end="00:27:28.369" style="s2">later just before she died she wrote</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.190" end="00:27:30.899" style="s2">another version of the same paper which</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.369" end="00:27:34.019" style="s2">later ended up in her posthumous book</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.899" end="00:27:36.539" style="s2">and where she says no there is another</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.019" end="00:27:38.580" style="s2">level which is to go beyond paradigm and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.539" end="00:27:40.739" style="s2">do the way I interpret that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.580" end="00:27:42.809" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is not to make the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.739" end="00:27:44.849" style="s2">mistake which we constantly do in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.809" end="00:27:46.830" style="s2">history of humanity of over swinging the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.849" end="00:27:49.679" style="s2">pendulum of going from one extreme view</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.830" end="00:27:53.369" style="s2">to another opposing extreme view like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.679" end="00:27:56.399" style="s2">thesis antithesis rather than coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.369" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">into a synthesis that that has exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.399" end="00:28:02.450" style="s2">that wisdom that you just spoke to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:07.379" style="s2">we will never live on a planet where a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.450" end="00:28:11.669" style="s2">baby is born with a kind of Humboldt</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.379" end="00:28:15.299" style="s2">Goethe type consciousness yeah it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.669" end="00:28:17.220" style="s2">of evolving and so we need to like what</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.299" end="00:28:19.139" style="s2">you just said like the the adage that</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.220" end="00:28:20.700" style="s2">spiral dynamics likes to say you have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.139" end="00:28:22.830" style="s2">speak to people where they&#39;re at or not</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.700" end="00:28:24.870" style="s2">where you want them to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:27.030" style="s2">how do we communicate about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.870" end="00:28:31.130" style="s2">keep the spiral or this developmental</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.030" end="00:28:35.700" style="s2">pathway that the will becomes matrix</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.130" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">open enough and healthy enough so at</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.700" end="00:28:42.560" style="s2">each developmental stage people can live</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:46.680" style="s2">out that particular view of the world</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.680" end="00:28:53.820" style="s2">earth because what what right now is</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.440" end="00:28:56.310" style="s2">that people are stuck in like in in</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.820" end="00:28:59.100" style="s2">spiral dynamics color language terms</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.310" end="00:29:02.190" style="s2">they&#39;re stuck in unhealthy blue or</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.100" end="00:29:04.560" style="s2">unhealthy orange or even unhealthy red</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.190" end="00:29:07.020" style="s2">and so that they&#39;re highly competitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.560" end="00:29:09.780" style="s2">or they&#39;re highly dogmatic or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.020" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">highly competitive in them in a more</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.780" end="00:29:17.460" style="s2">sort of intellectual really kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.450" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">and and how do we get people into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.460" end="00:29:25.560" style="s2">space where we we heal each of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:30.050" style="s2">levels and make them regenerative so</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.560" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">people can go through that cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.050" end="00:29:35.400" style="s2">keep transcendence include as will the</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.770" style="s2">likes to call it keep the the best of</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:17.630" style="s2">outlined the issue very well and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.890" end="00:30:22.020" style="s2">facing some very difficult problems</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.020" end="00:30:30.210" style="s2">been a characteristic of organisms</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.270" end="00:30:40.900" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of what we&#39;re done with</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:44.380" style="s2">the environment I think we&#39;re saying oh</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:49.150" style="s2">and not really addressing long-term</p>

<p begin="00:32:59.110" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">visited David or at Oberlin and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:08.500" style="s2">interviewed him about his work and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:10.420" style="s2">asked him what he thought the dimension</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.500" end="00:33:12.370" style="s2">of spirituality and the sacred was in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.420" end="00:33:16.300" style="s2">the transition that is now ahead of us</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.370" end="00:33:18.520" style="s2">and David gave me a really good answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.300" end="00:33:21.640" style="s2">where he said a number of things but</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:24.820" style="s2">among them he said before we can find</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.640" end="00:33:28.330" style="s2">meaningful answers and sensible answers</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.820" end="00:33:30.820" style="s2">to what we need to do to be sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.330" end="00:33:34.030" style="s2">and how we might go about achieving that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.820" end="00:33:36.310" style="s2">we have to ask ourself a much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.030" end="00:33:39.220" style="s2">question which is what is it about our</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.310" end="00:33:40.840" style="s2">very young species that right now is one</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.220" end="00:33:44.380" style="s2">of the youngest on the planet like we</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:08.440" style="s2">and we get one of the first signs of</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.569" end="00:35:12.180" style="s2">intelligence we see evolutionary is art</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.660" end="00:35:34.210" style="s2">in general is one of the most valuable</p>

<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:52.809" style="s2">them same is true with music but why</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.089" end="00:35:56.589" style="s2">we&#39;re worth more than other organisms I</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.809" end="00:35:58.900" style="s2">don&#39;t really know that we are I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.589" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">really have an answer for why we should</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:10.599" style="s2">to apply that in any way we are more</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.989" end="00:36:12.249" style="s2">workers than others but but what I and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.599" end="00:36:14.670" style="s2">think well you&#39;re you did answer it</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.249" end="00:36:17.230" style="s2">because there are expressions that we</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.670" end="00:36:20.859" style="s2">like in in in the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.230" end="00:36:22.839" style="s2">question David also said that we we are</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.859" end="00:36:25.539" style="s2">meaning seeking creatures for and he</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.839" end="00:36:28.180" style="s2">actually started at exactly the same</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.180" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">first time will you spit some paint</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.249" end="00:36:37.029" style="s2">against right on a cave wall to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:40.089" style="s2">that imprint that&#39;s a sign of a species</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.029" end="00:36:44.890" style="s2">that is asking Who am I and where do I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.089" end="00:36:47.650" style="s2">come from where am I going and and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.890" end="00:36:50.109" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this process of of meaning</p>

<p begin="00:36:50.109" end="00:37:00.890" style="s2">maybe we can create a convincing enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.610" end="00:37:06.160" style="s2">narrative of our past our significance</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.890" end="00:37:09.860" style="s2">and our potential of serving life that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.160" end="00:37:13.940" style="s2">could be expressed in slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.860" end="00:37:16.700" style="s2">language with slightly different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.940" end="00:37:20.450" style="s2">hot buttons and cold buttons so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.700" end="00:37:23.360" style="s2">yeah speak to the different levels of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.450" end="00:37:26.930" style="s2">consciousness that you UN can mapped out</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.360" end="00:37:30.430" style="s2">that the developmental power but that</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.930" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">have a common theme that that ink</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.430" end="00:37:36.970" style="s2">actually includes in the narrative that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:43.040" style="s2">journey of deeper deepening of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.970" end="00:37:47.480" style="s2">perspective broadening as part of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:49.790" style="s2">connected um I&#39;m thinking out loud here</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.480" end="00:37:52.660" style="s2">well you&#39;ve thought about this more</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.790" end="00:38:00.010" style="s2">deeply than I have that&#39;s pretty clear</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.660" end="00:38:02.630" style="s2">I&#39;m a big fan of young captures view of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.010" end="00:38:05.420" style="s2">well he didn&#39;t call it evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.630" end="00:38:06.920" style="s2">consciousness because he didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.420" end="00:38:09.380" style="s2">get tangled up with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.920" end="00:38:11.750" style="s2">evolutionary arguments that have and do</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.380" end="00:38:14.270" style="s2">go on but he certainly looked at</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.750" end="00:38:17.570" style="s2">evolution as a developmental process and</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.270" end="00:38:20.740" style="s2">I mean consciousness over time he has</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.570" end="00:38:24.380" style="s2">these various social psychological</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.740" end="00:38:25.610" style="s2">stages and he talks about integral</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.380" end="00:38:28.520" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.610" end="00:38:32.500" style="s2">and I think he talks about it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.520" end="00:38:34.520" style="s2">that is more satisfying to me personally</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.500" end="00:38:37.400" style="s2">if I wanted to say I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.520" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">criticize chin Wilbur but I will say</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.400" end="00:38:43.340" style="s2">that chin is a very cognitive guy I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:47.780" style="s2">think of him as very Apollonian he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.340" end="00:38:51.260" style="s2">brilliance of the mind and and captures</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.780" end="00:38:54.470" style="s2">notion of integral and he said here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.260" end="00:38:58.040" style="s2">what he said it to be integral to live</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.470" end="00:38:59.840" style="s2">all structures at all times now Ken</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.040" end="00:39:03.980" style="s2">would disagree with that because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.840" end="00:39:06.410" style="s2">you want to go up levels and if you go</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.980" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">out four levels the lower levels come</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.410" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">under control of the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.970" end="00:39:14.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole different kind of concept</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:19.700" style="s2">is much more PJ and I guess but what</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.890" end="00:39:23.030" style="s2">what gebser was interested in was having</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.700" end="00:39:26.299" style="s2">all levels active at any moment and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.030" end="00:39:31.309" style="s2">mean you think what this means magical</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.299" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">is about poetry about music especially</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.309" end="00:39:38.210" style="s2">about music mythic is about imagination</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:41.900" style="s2">mental is of course oh we all know what</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.210" end="00:39:44.900" style="s2">mental is we&#39;ve got too much of it so</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.900" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">the point being that a rich life</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.900" end="00:39:50.630" style="s2">somebody asked me once how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:52.789" style="s2">educate a person or train them to tip</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.630" end="00:39:56.510" style="s2">for internal consciousness and I said</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.789" end="00:39:58.880" style="s2">senator liberal arts college let them</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.510" end="00:40:02.450" style="s2">learn music of literature and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.880" end="00:40:06.650" style="s2">and use their mind and use their</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.450" end="00:40:09.260" style="s2">emotions so you know when I look around</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.650" end="00:40:11.720" style="s2">my office I have several translations of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.260" end="00:40:16.819" style="s2">the Odyssey and the Iliad for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.720" end="00:40:19.130" style="s2">and mythic stories and so on and these</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.819" end="00:40:22.369" style="s2">enrich life I&#39;m not a very religious</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.130" end="00:40:25.700" style="s2">person but religion is about myth and a</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.369" end="00:40:28.730" style="s2">pound away so these are the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.700" end="00:40:31.039" style="s2">give life meaning come on</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.730" end="00:40:35.079" style="s2">to me that that gets a perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.039" end="00:40:39.349" style="s2">integral is so much healthier then that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.079" end="00:40:41.690" style="s2">make it way whether Kenan is doing this</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.349" end="00:40:44.839" style="s2">actively or passively I don&#39;t think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.690" end="00:40:46.460" style="s2">meaning to do it actively somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.839" end="00:40:47.839" style="s2">reading of a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.460" end="00:40:51.619" style="s2">integral or the spiral dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.839" end="00:40:54.349" style="s2">community I mean I used to teach on</p>

<p begin="00:40:54.349" end="00:41:00.740" style="s2">dynamics and it didn&#39;t matter how many</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.440" end="00:41:03.200" style="s2">times I said it&#39;s not about types of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.740" end="00:41:07.730" style="s2">people it&#39;s about types in people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.200" end="00:41:11.000" style="s2">um it&#39;s a delivery thing and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.730" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">at the end of the class people will go</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.329" end="00:41:23.820" style="s2">look in the console</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">see world like everybody said like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.820" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of people out</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:31.080" style="s2">there who set up consultancies to help</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:38.810" style="s2">companies to become teal organizations</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.080" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2">or and I that just sets up a false</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.810" end="00:41:44.520" style="s2">competitiveness of in a one-upmanship of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.670" end="00:41:46.170" style="s2">who I&#39;m so much better because I can see</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:49.190" style="s2">the world from a turquoise perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.170" end="00:41:56.730" style="s2">instead of saying we need the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:59.220" style="s2">healthy spectrum well I agree and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.730" end="00:42:02.760" style="s2">difficult because each of us has had our</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.220" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">own place sees the world from our own</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.760" end="00:42:10.740" style="s2">perspective in some sense so it involves</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:13.250" style="s2">a lot of humility and recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.740" end="00:42:16.320" style="s2">other people have valid points of view</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.250" end="00:42:19.740" style="s2">and in order to get anywhere and move</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.320" end="00:42:22.560" style="s2">forward in any practical political real</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.740" end="00:42:25.010" style="s2">world sense we have to get inside of</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.560" end="00:42:28.320" style="s2">those and help those people actualize</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:33.270" style="s2">the best parts of those perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.320" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">they have so for example what</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.270" end="00:42:38.070" style="s2">perspective isn&#39;t where you find</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:40.770" style="s2">traditional religions Mormonism for</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.070" end="00:42:42.900" style="s2">example well there&#39;s no point in arguing</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.770" end="00:42:45.630" style="s2">with them about it or trying to you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.900" end="00:42:47.160" style="s2">move them on but you&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.630" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">time on your hands and they&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.160" end="00:42:54.930" style="s2">to listen but what can you do to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:58.830" style="s2">facilitate their worldview in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.930" end="00:43:02.160" style="s2">is compatible with others and will help</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.830" end="00:43:03.780" style="s2">in the big a bigger picture now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.160" end="00:43:05.280" style="s2">going to tell you you don&#39;t know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.780" end="00:43:07.410" style="s2">thought about these things much more</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.280" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">than me understand surely a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.410" end="00:43:13.020" style="s2">and a philosopher I just would love to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:15.840" style="s2">like what what I said well for me is so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.020" end="00:43:20.460" style="s2">nice to be able to to just compare and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.840" end="00:43:22.770" style="s2">contrast like because a lot of this view</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.460" end="00:43:25.830" style="s2">that that I&#39;ve developed is also</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.770" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">influenced by one of my mentors um Brian</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.830" end="00:43:32.730" style="s2">Goodwin who was a bio Brown who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:34.980" style="s2">wonderful and and Brian was the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.730" end="00:43:37.260" style="s2">like from a complexity perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.980" end="00:43:40.440" style="s2">to zero it doesn&#39;t really make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.260" end="00:43:44.099" style="s2">explain life and consciousness ex nihilo</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.440" end="00:43:49.530" style="s2">and it makes so much money evades the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.099" end="00:43:51.990" style="s2">entire complexity and when like at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.530" end="00:43:54.450" style="s2">baguette there the quote that I read at</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.990" end="00:43:57.990" style="s2">the beginning you say conscious is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.450" end="00:44:00.359" style="s2">an epidermal on of the brain Brian also</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.990" end="00:44:02.130" style="s2">completely pointed this out that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.359" end="00:44:05.420" style="s2">Gregory Bateson that mind and</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.130" end="00:44:09.140" style="s2">consciousness is not inside this skull</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.420" end="00:44:15.210" style="s2">coming out of just brain activity and</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.140" end="00:44:18.690" style="s2">what why do you say that and like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.210" end="00:44:23.430" style="s2">agree but but um when where do you see</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.690" end="00:44:25.760" style="s2">the seat of consciousness then Oh what</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.430" end="00:44:28.380" style="s2">now that&#39;s a whole different question I</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.760" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">think probably looking for the seat of</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.380" end="00:44:33.869" style="s2">consciousness and further wrong-minded</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:36.930" style="s2">question yeah maybe that was bad no why</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.869" end="00:44:40.290" style="s2">do you say that um like how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.930" end="00:44:41.850" style="s2">away from the view that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.290" end="00:44:46.200" style="s2">consciousness is an epitome an</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.850" end="00:44:49.620" style="s2">epiphenomenon of brain activity and how</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.200" end="00:44:51.270" style="s2">can we explain it yeah well you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.620" end="00:44:56.760" style="s2">is the heart of one of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.270" end="00:44:59.940" style="s2">enigmas that we know of relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.760" end="00:45:04.740" style="s2">the mind of the brain and it&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.940" end="00:45:06.660" style="s2">paradoxes as I said I tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.740" end="00:45:10.020" style="s2">something of a paying psychist which</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.660" end="00:45:12.150" style="s2">means that I think consciousness is why</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.020" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">the distributed in the cosmos and really</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.150" end="00:45:18.420" style="s2">a part of it and certainly part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:20.280" style="s2">higher organisms but with the brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.420" end="00:45:22.590" style="s2">very I mean I&#39;m teaching a course on</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.280" end="00:45:26.370" style="s2">consciousness right now and here on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.590" end="00:45:29.580" style="s2">one hand we know that certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.370" end="00:45:35.010" style="s2">brain disorders profoundly affect</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.580" end="00:45:37.290" style="s2">consciousness in fact I we had a whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.010" end="00:45:39.300" style="s2">seminar at one of the Tucson meetings a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.290" end="00:45:42.450" style="s2">few years ago about the locked-in</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.300" end="00:45:44.730" style="s2">syndrome and this is what a person&#39;s had</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.450" end="00:45:47.060" style="s2">serious a serious stroke in their</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.730" end="00:45:51.210" style="s2">conscious and a wage and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.060" end="00:45:53.070" style="s2">control anything of their body except</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.210" end="00:45:55.200" style="s2">usually their eye movements you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.070" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a movie and a book called the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.200" end="00:46:00.870" style="s2">butterfly in the diving belt</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:02.670" style="s2">written by a person who was actually in</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.870" end="00:46:05.700" style="s2">the locked-in syndrome but was able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.670" end="00:46:07.650" style="s2">communicate by looking at letters one</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.700" end="00:46:11.940" style="s2">after another really big painting the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.650" end="00:46:13.890" style="s2">book okay so I have students that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.940" end="00:46:15.840" style="s2">like to think consciousness is free of</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.890" end="00:46:19.020" style="s2">the brain everybody had to put up with</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.840" end="00:46:21.600" style="s2">that sort of thing on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.020" end="00:46:24.780" style="s2">do know that people have out of the body</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.600" end="00:46:29.610" style="s2">experiences they seem to be quite valid</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.780" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">or these have been studied sometimes in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.610" end="00:46:34.890" style="s2">dreams sometimes in near-death</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:38.010" style="s2">experiences clearly people have</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.890" end="00:46:39.900" style="s2">experiences out of the body but they</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.010" end="00:46:43.370" style="s2">seem to be out of the body and they seem</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.900" end="00:46:46.020" style="s2">to locate themselves out of the body I</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.370" end="00:46:48.600" style="s2">should talk a lot about that that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.020" end="00:46:51.120" style="s2">of thing that interests me but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.600" end="00:46:53.530" style="s2">that it&#39;s a consciousness can in some</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.120" end="00:46:55.870" style="s2">sense be out of the body and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.530" end="00:46:57.850" style="s2">in some very real sense is non-local</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.870" end="00:47:01.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of people are liking to call</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.850" end="00:47:03.490" style="s2">it nowadays so how is it possible why is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.150" end="00:47:05.890" style="s2">it so connected to the brain and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.490" end="00:47:12.700" style="s2">independent of the brain at the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.890" end="00:47:15.430" style="s2">time I don&#39;t know it&#39;s a mystery this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.700" end="00:47:17.530" style="s2">again an area of science that some</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.430" end="00:47:21.940" style="s2">people find hard to venture into but</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.530" end="00:47:24.880" style="s2">Dena Robbins work on remote viewing for</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.940" end="00:47:28.210" style="s2">example this just seems to have been in</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:31.000" style="s2">Norfolk documented cases of people being</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.210" end="00:47:34.510" style="s2">able to remote view which would would</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.000" end="00:47:38.260" style="s2">kind of speak to the non-local potential</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.510" end="00:47:42.370" style="s2">yeah yeah but you probably have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.260" end="00:47:44.890" style="s2">here too old real magic and hadn&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.370" end="00:47:46.450" style="s2">it now oh it&#39;s a great little book I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.890" end="00:47:47.290" style="s2">actually wrote to him about it because I</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.450" end="00:47:50.410" style="s2">wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.290" end="00:47:53.010" style="s2">years and years ago on synchronicity and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.410" end="00:47:56.680" style="s2">he has a whole section of synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.010" end="00:48:00.970" style="s2">synchronistic events in that book which</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.680" end="00:48:04.210" style="s2">he attributes to magic real magic and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.970" end="00:48:05.380" style="s2">don&#39;t disagree with him but we you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.210" end="00:48:07.390" style="s2">we approach it from two different</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.380" end="00:48:10.900" style="s2">directions and we both seem to be coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.390" end="00:48:12.760" style="s2">to the same conclusions for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.900" end="00:48:14.920" style="s2">during the founding of Finn horn there</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.760" end="00:48:19.270" style="s2">were you know what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.920" end="00:48:21.640" style="s2">Peter yeah I mean he created no place</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.270" end="00:48:24.940" style="s2">out of either magic or seeker in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.640" end="00:48:27.010" style="s2">year ever you want to call it it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.940" end="00:48:29.940" style="s2">just an amazing story I should I heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.010" end="00:48:34.990" style="s2">him talk about it you probably met him</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.940" end="00:48:39.460" style="s2">but where am I was this clearly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.990" end="00:48:43.480" style="s2">remote viewing is very real when it</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.460" end="00:48:45.790" style="s2">works and there&#39;s just so many</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.480" end="00:48:48.460" style="s2">experiences people have out of the body</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.790" end="00:48:50.560" style="s2">experiences during surgery where they</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.460" end="00:48:52.840" style="s2">can tell you what the room looks like</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.560" end="00:48:55.240" style="s2">from up at the ceiling or even maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.840" end="00:48:57.790" style="s2">they went down the hall and say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.240" end="00:48:59.860" style="s2">going on down there and another whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.790" end="00:49:01.890" style="s2">area that that I know that some of your</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.860" end="00:49:04.300" style="s2">colleagues at CIS have been</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.890" end="00:49:06.150" style="s2">investigating is and for me this is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.300" end="00:49:09.059" style="s2">an M</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.150" end="00:49:12.720" style="s2">a deeper question of inquiry is like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.059" end="00:49:18.049" style="s2">in my past I&#39;ve done some experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.720" end="00:49:21.660" style="s2">with psychoactive substances that expand</p>

<p begin="00:49:28.079" end="00:49:33.980" style="s2">keep wondering whether one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:40.740" style="s2">reasons why we couldn&#39;t disconnected so</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.980" end="00:49:42.569" style="s2">profoundly from life as the wider</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.440" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">the more than human world and to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:50:00.210" style="s2">maybe our taboo on these type of sacred</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">plants and the use of these sacred</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.210" end="00:50:04.910" style="s2">plants has closed the door of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.569" end="00:50:11.670" style="s2">breadth of the awareness that that our</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.490" end="00:50:14.250" style="s2">species through its evolution has just</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.670" end="00:50:16.500" style="s2">always been engaged with like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.250" end="00:50:19.859" style="s2">there&#39;s even people who who suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.500" end="00:50:22.770" style="s2">possibly that&#39;s what enabled to jump</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.859" end="00:50:25.349" style="s2">from a primate brain that is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.770" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">complex and has pretty complex things to</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.069" end="00:50:37.470" style="s2">and and also in terms of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.430" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">pattern and spectrum that there may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.470" end="00:50:42.510" style="s2">the use of these plants has actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:58.710" style="s2">been a key element in our evolution they</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.510" end="00:51:05.490" style="s2">really we&#39;re seeing especially here in</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.710" end="00:51:10.859" style="s2">California but resurgence of serious</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.490" end="00:51:13.069" style="s2">interest in psychotropic there were now</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.859" end="00:51:16.220" style="s2">they&#39;re calling them in thien&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.069" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">where we still cycle psychedelic drugs</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.220" end="00:51:22.460" style="s2">or agents</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:25.010" style="s2">these have clearly been a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.460" end="00:51:28.130" style="s2">human experience any for as long as</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.010" end="00:51:30.140" style="s2">there have been humans one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.130" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">popular ones right now I shouldn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.140" end="00:51:35.960" style="s2">the word popular but you know it&#39;s uh oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:42.950" style="s2">what&#39;s it called now I&#39;m speaking too</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.960" end="00:51:47.960" style="s2">quick ayahuasca hmm yeah don&#39;t try this</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.950" end="00:51:55.150" style="s2">at home very powerful drug but I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.960" end="00:51:58.390" style="s2">students now psychedelic experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.150" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">haven&#39;t had them since the 60s so</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.390" end="00:52:05.270" style="s2">research is going on it&#39;s now becoming</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:09.560" style="s2">at least accepted that these drugs might</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.270" end="00:52:11.990" style="s2">be helpful in medical ways but whether</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.560" end="00:52:13.220" style="s2">they help earth the human mind or not I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.990" end="00:52:15.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know I certainly wouldn&#39;t argue</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.220" end="00:52:19.070" style="s2">against it I think if you go back far</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.830" end="00:52:20.690" style="s2">enough people are yeah we will ever find</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.070" end="00:52:22.730" style="s2">a clear answer to that but but I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.690" end="00:52:25.670" style="s2">it is a valid question to explore</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.730" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">because I mean it does from my</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.670" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">experiences particularly with with</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:36.800" style="s2">psilocybin um it it really brings you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">more interior intuitive connected animal</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.800" end="00:52:46.180" style="s2">body and your whole way of perceiving oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">so sorry we&#39;ll do a mescaline desert to</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.180" end="00:52:54.589" style="s2">Iceland does to it makes you very</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">embodied in the way probably horny it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.589" end="00:53:02.300" style="s2">another way of the wider yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:06.050" style="s2">just I just sensed that that maybe we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.300" end="00:53:08.330" style="s2">we&#39;ve possibly through the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.050" end="00:53:12.230" style="s2">Church I don&#39;t know when when that taboo</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.330" end="00:53:18.520" style="s2">came in so strongly but of the use of</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.230" end="00:53:21.840" style="s2">these substances is partially the giving</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.520" end="00:53:25.410" style="s2">over the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.840" end="00:53:28.170" style="s2">to a priest rather than to actively in</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.410" end="00:53:29.790" style="s2">community I have experiences and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.170" end="00:53:32.790" style="s2">spiritual connection to a wider hole</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.790" end="00:53:34.740" style="s2">through ceremony with I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.790" end="00:53:36.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a big difference I find between</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.740" end="00:53:38.520" style="s2">the ceremonial use of these substances</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.690" end="00:53:40.500" style="s2">and the kind of recreational use of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.520" end="00:53:42.120" style="s2">these substances and I think if the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.500" end="00:53:45.480" style="s2">recreational use can be very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.120" end="00:53:49.260" style="s2">and in kind of pleasure-seeking and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.480" end="00:53:54.740" style="s2">not necessarily healthy and and but the</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.260" end="00:53:57.720" style="s2">the using the mass sacrament as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.740" end="00:54:03.090" style="s2">what we call the recreational use is</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.720" end="00:54:06.450" style="s2">often valuable opening up new channels</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.090" end="00:54:09.210" style="s2">of understanding in reality I&#39;ve met and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.450" end="00:54:11.310" style="s2">you should you have to ensure people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.210" end="00:54:16.890" style="s2">have served awakened to a larger</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.310" end="00:54:23.120" style="s2">universe through LSD or some other agent</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.890" end="00:54:27.390" style="s2">and then pursue a life of searching and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.120" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">you know a broader life of interest and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.390" end="00:54:34.470" style="s2">searching and looking into oneself</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:36.090" style="s2">because of that category I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.470" end="00:54:42.870" style="s2">what which came first the chicken or the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.090" end="00:54:44.760" style="s2">egg but but yeah well of course that was</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.870" end="00:54:46.230" style="s2">the problem in the sixties people would</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.760" end="00:54:56.070" style="s2">take these drugs and then they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.230" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">be Republicans anymore so yes so</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.070" end="00:55:02.910" style="s2">strongly crack down on them and but by</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">the way we just we just lost a month or</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.910" end="00:55:11.970" style="s2">two ago friend of mine that live Bernier</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">made rough mr. mm-hmm probably there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.970" end="00:55:17.820" style="s2">no man alive who knew as much about</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:21.330" style="s2">alternate alternative states of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.820" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">consciousness and psychoactive agencies</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.330" end="00:55:26.610" style="s2">my troth Nets mister who continued to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">write about these things throughout his</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.610" end="00:55:31.560" style="s2">whole life and as long as we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:34.050" style="s2">about him I&#39;m talking about it one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.560" end="00:55:35.500" style="s2">his last books was felled the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.050" end="00:55:39.099" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.500" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">which is the titles a little tricky</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.099" end="00:55:46.510" style="s2">because it suggests that it&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:48.940" style="s2">in his green consciousness&#39; work which</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.510" end="00:55:51.130" style="s2">is a little different but the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.940" end="00:55:53.920" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s just a huge book of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.130" end="00:55:57.970" style="s2">every topic you can think of collecting</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.920" end="00:56:00.550" style="s2">his experience totally fascinating I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.970" end="00:56:02.500" style="s2">read a lot of myths in the 20 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.550" end="00:56:04.630" style="s2">when it was a true Mahakali I read</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.500" end="00:56:06.580" style="s2">anything since to that I&#39;ll pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.630" end="00:56:08.050" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a couple of more</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.580" end="00:56:11.220" style="s2">things that I wanted to get your</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.050" end="00:56:13.420" style="s2">perspective on because so like this</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.220" end="00:56:16.150" style="s2">there&#39;s this big question what is life</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.420" end="00:56:20.020" style="s2">what is consciousness and but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.150" end="00:56:22.300" style="s2">also one that I think might be a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.020" end="00:56:29.980" style="s2">bit downriver from it which is what is</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.300" end="00:56:32.950" style="s2">time like the way we perceive so much of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.980" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">how we perceive time and how we locate</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.950" end="00:56:40.060" style="s2">ourselves with relationship to the past</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:43.240" style="s2">the present and the future maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.060" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">the sense that we currently have of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.240" end="00:56:49.750" style="s2">linear era of time but it says the past</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">is in behind us and the future is in</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.750" end="00:56:58.270" style="s2">front of us is to my mind the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:57:02.700" style="s2">property that like that it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.270" end="00:57:07.510" style="s2">experience that emerges out of how we</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.700" end="00:57:10.830" style="s2">explain our participatory agency in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.510" end="00:57:13.869" style="s2">world so so basically if we don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.830" end="00:57:17.400" style="s2">there seems to be an illusion of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.869" end="00:57:20.770" style="s2">the it makes for me perfect sense that</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.400" end="00:57:23.380" style="s2">like JG Bennett had this very complex</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.770" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">notion of time using all these Greek</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.380" end="00:57:30.339" style="s2">terms like hypothesis and so on where he</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">opened up the possibility that the past</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.339" end="00:57:36.190" style="s2">and the future are Co present in the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:40.800" style="s2">place that we can ever only be which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.190" end="00:57:44.730" style="s2">the experiential moment of the of now M</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.800" end="00:57:48.170" style="s2">what&#39;s your take on time and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.730" end="00:57:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s totally baffling I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.170" end="00:57:54.829" style="s2">fascinated by time myself for many years</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.480" end="00:57:57.160" style="s2">recently I&#39;ve realized how tightly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.829" end="00:58:01.010" style="s2">connected to the questioner pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.160" end="00:58:05.900" style="s2">for example William James talked about</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.010" end="00:58:07.849" style="s2">this quite a bit he you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.900" end="00:58:10.160" style="s2">well--there&#39;s it was for the block</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.849" end="00:58:13.490" style="s2">universe you&#39;re probably familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.160" end="00:58:16.220" style="s2">this notion James talked about well the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.490" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">block universe is just says that theater</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.220" end="00:58:22.819" style="s2">is some big multi-dimensional block I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:25.700" style="s2">think you would find at nine Stein and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.819" end="00:58:29.270" style="s2">if any system that says you can move</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.700" end="00:58:33.950" style="s2">forwards and backwards in it suggests</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.270" end="00:58:36.859" style="s2">that it somehow is fixed it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.950" end="00:58:38.540" style="s2">so the block universe if you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.859" end="00:58:41.720" style="s2">time travel you believe in a block</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.540" end="00:58:44.030" style="s2">universe because it&#39;s still there</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.720" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">somewhere and you can go backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.030" end="00:58:49.670" style="s2">forwards and of course if you stick to</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:52.579" style="s2">very traditional physics you can run the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.670" end="00:58:54.680" style="s2">equations backwards and forwards it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.579" end="00:58:59.059" style="s2">very Newtonian view so that&#39;s the block</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.680" end="00:59:03.140" style="s2">universe and probably most views of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.059" end="00:59:06.109" style="s2">evolution and a time come somehow out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.140" end="00:59:08.930" style="s2">the block universe view a but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.109" end="00:59:11.930" style="s2">have free will anything like that I</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.930" end="00:59:14.329" style="s2">don&#39;t think it suggests everything is</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.930" end="00:59:17.900" style="s2">already predetermined forwards and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.329" end="00:59:21.109" style="s2">backwards so where&#39;s the free will the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.900" end="00:59:23.750" style="s2">other view one I&#39;m a big proponent of</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.109" end="00:59:26.690" style="s2">but doesn&#39;t allow time travel so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.750" end="00:59:31.970" style="s2">too bad for some of the stories is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.690" end="00:59:37.460" style="s2">process view in that time is really</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.970" end="00:59:41.180" style="s2">defined by the ongoing process of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.460" end="00:59:44.630" style="s2">cosmos and forward process you can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.180" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">backwards in fact it&#39;s very closely</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.630" end="00:59:56.200" style="s2">related to complexity theory and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:58.390" style="s2">that when you drop a cube of sugar in a</p>

<p begin="01:00:00.760" end="01:00:06.549" style="s2">direction well that&#39;s a process process</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.670" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">for you the way time works in fact you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.549" end="01:00:10.420" style="s2">can&#39;t run it back we can&#39;t put it back</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.420" end="01:00:16.089" style="s2">said but you and I can&#39;t so I&#39;m training</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.349" end="01:00:18.609" style="s2">remember there&#39;s a physicist who has</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.089" end="01:00:21.190" style="s2">written about this a lot and continues</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.609" end="01:00:23.769" style="s2">to write very popular I could the amount</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.190" end="01:00:26.289" style="s2">sending time thing is Solomon for some</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.769" end="01:00:27.460" style="s2">maaske reason I&#39;m driving distillation</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.289" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.460" end="01:00:34.450" style="s2">well David Bohm had a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:39.640" style="s2">angle on untighten and the that saw time</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.450" end="01:00:43.269" style="s2">much more and yeah as a process and well</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.640" end="01:00:45.579" style="s2">he was a big process thinker yeah but it</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.269" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">was really who wasn&#39;t to develop the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.579" end="01:00:49.990" style="s2">view of time really in a fundamental way</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:51.309" style="s2">I should have made notes be there in</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.990" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">trouble remembering he doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.309" end="01:01:00.970" style="s2">about winning physicist that talks about</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:02.619" style="s2">creativity if you want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.970" end="01:01:06.339" style="s2">creativity you can&#39;t do the block</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.619" end="01:01:08.680" style="s2">universe either so his name will</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.339" end="01:01:10.930" style="s2">probably come to me because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.680" end="01:01:15.519" style="s2">associated with time consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.930" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">creativity so that&#39;s I have a process</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.519" end="01:01:19.990" style="s2">view time but it&#39;s it&#39;s a big mystery</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:23.049" style="s2">yeah but now that you brought up the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.990" end="01:01:26.019" style="s2">topic I&#39;m reading a book called time</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.049" end="01:01:26.650" style="s2">loops mm-hmm have you ever heard of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.019" end="01:01:31.619" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.650" end="01:01:36.519" style="s2">no conducts time loops and it&#39;s by eric</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.619" end="01:01:38.349" style="s2">Wargo w arg oh very far go and I mention</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.519" end="01:01:41.890" style="s2">this because if you try to find time</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.349" end="01:01:43.779" style="s2">loops at Amazon or something you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.890" end="01:01:49.299" style="s2">eight or ten books most in science</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.779" end="01:01:54.130" style="s2">fiction Oh Argo is a recent PhD from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.299" end="01:01:59.230" style="s2">University of Georgia and seen an</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.130" end="01:02:03.750" style="s2">anthropologist and he has done an</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.230" end="01:02:08.520" style="s2">amazingly scholarly job of looking at</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.750" end="01:02:12.210" style="s2">possibility that people experience the</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.520" end="01:02:15.180" style="s2">future the near future in very concrete</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.210" end="01:02:18.990" style="s2">ways and dreams and visions and so on</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.180" end="01:02:21.260" style="s2">and here&#39;s the catch these future</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.990" end="01:02:25.460" style="s2">visions feed back to what we do today</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.260" end="01:02:29.060" style="s2">mm-hmm and I mean he makes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.460" end="01:02:33.600" style="s2">fascinating case for this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.060" end="01:02:35.280" style="s2">for example I won&#39;t go into detail be</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.600" end="01:02:37.080" style="s2">thought about this right now or but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.280" end="01:02:40.350" style="s2">famous are you sure maybe with a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.080" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">famous Carl Jung synchronicity case of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.350" end="01:02:46.860" style="s2">the scarab beetle Chuck yeah when you</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:50.400" style="s2">yeah well there you know so so this lady</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.860" end="01:02:53.190" style="s2">is good and she&#39;s a client she&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.400" end="01:02:55.430" style="s2">go see her therapist Carl Jung who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.190" end="01:02:59.100" style="s2">famous for his weird and wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.430" end="01:03:04.680" style="s2">mystical ideas about occultism and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.100" end="01:03:07.790" style="s2">everything else and she how does this</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.680" end="01:03:10.230" style="s2">work she essentially creates the event</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.790" end="01:03:12.750" style="s2">where she talks about the Scarabaeus</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.230" end="01:03:14.430" style="s2">people and and and and he waves his hand</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.750" end="01:03:18.590" style="s2">and catches one in his hand and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.430" end="01:03:23.030" style="s2">bailiff oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.590" end="01:03:25.070" style="s2">but the point is that she had dreams</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.030" end="01:03:29.180" style="s2">about this sort of thing ahead of time</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.070" end="01:03:33.320" style="s2">and did she create an event from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.180" end="01:03:37.040" style="s2">dream I&#39;d have you better look through</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.320" end="01:03:39.710" style="s2">it interesting because so many of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.040" end="01:03:43.040" style="s2">indigenous wisdom holders have a deep</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.710" end="01:03:46.340" style="s2">deep attention to dreaming that again</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.040" end="01:03:48.140" style="s2">our culture doesn&#39;t but if original</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.340" end="01:03:51.020" style="s2">culture but but anywhere in the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.140" end="01:03:54.050" style="s2">and indigenous cultures pay a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.020" end="01:03:57.110" style="s2">attention to dreams and and I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.050" end="01:04:04.310" style="s2">had a number of experiences in my life</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.110" end="01:04:06.950" style="s2">where I would see a place seemingly for</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.310" end="01:04:09.590" style="s2">the first time and then after having</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.950" end="01:04:11.570" style="s2">seen it I would have this and I still</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.590" end="01:04:14.450" style="s2">can&#39;t really put my hand in the fire for</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.570" end="01:04:18.770" style="s2">it what I would call either real or</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.450" end="01:04:21.260" style="s2">false there&#39;s a mood of saying wow the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.770" end="01:04:22.880" style="s2">place we saw today I dreamt about years</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.260" end="01:04:26.300" style="s2">ago in that dream where I woke up</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.880" end="01:04:29.180" style="s2">thinking how much detail was in this</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.300" end="01:04:31.430" style="s2">dream why did I in this dream go into</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.180" end="01:04:33.290" style="s2">such detail about a particular place and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.430" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">then suddenly three years later I find</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.290" end="01:04:40.070" style="s2">myself in in exactly enjoy this book yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">even it gets even more complex because</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.070" end="01:04:45.830" style="s2">of the dream you had about this thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.700" style="s2">the future may affect the way you</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.830" end="01:04:51.530" style="s2">respond to it when you get there so</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.700" end="01:04:54.890" style="s2">there&#39;s this sort of feedback that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.530" end="01:04:56.750" style="s2">very weird and when I first heard it I</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.890" end="01:05:00.290" style="s2">couldn&#39;t take it seriously at all but</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.750" end="01:05:05.270" style="s2">now that I&#39;ve been reading it it does a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.290" end="01:05:07.550" style="s2">wonderful job you know I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.270" end="01:05:12.680" style="s2">recall the detailed stories right now I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.550" end="01:05:16.700" style="s2">wish I could but he really realized</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.680" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">Freud and a lot of the stuff about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.700" end="01:05:22.130" style="s2">unconscious and shows that it could be</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">in fact a product that this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.130" end="01:05:29.210" style="s2">weird reality and was people see things</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:32.540" style="s2">in the future and innocence and create</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.210" end="01:05:34.910" style="s2">them and so this was real</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.540" end="01:05:36.680" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not doing a very</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.910" end="01:05:39.230" style="s2">good job of describing it but his</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.680" end="01:05:42.140" style="s2">treatment of Jung and Freud the</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.230" end="01:05:45.050" style="s2">unconscious and a lot of the symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.140" end="01:05:48.550" style="s2">material in relation to this strange</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.050" end="01:05:51.320" style="s2">business about time and it also has a</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.550" end="01:05:52.910" style="s2">fascinating chapter about the science</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.320" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">fiction writer what&#39;s his name</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.910" end="01:05:57.560" style="s2">a philip k dick mm-hmm you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:05:59.630" style="s2">two-thirds of the science fiction movies</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.560" end="01:06:03.010" style="s2">come straight out of philip k dick he</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.630" end="01:06:06.770" style="s2">lived near me in California and he had</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.010" end="01:06:09.020" style="s2">precognitive dreams all the time he</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.770" end="01:06:13.040" style="s2">based his story about a lot of them and</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.020" end="01:06:16.550" style="s2">it&#39;s just very weird and one interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.040" end="01:06:18.410" style="s2">stuff so anyway finally look into like</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.550" end="01:06:21.050" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll even call him up and have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.410" end="01:06:27.080" style="s2">conversation with him at some point he</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.050" end="01:06:31.840" style="s2">will talk to his young PhD by the way he</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.080" end="01:06:35.150" style="s2">talked at Esalen about a year ago and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.840" end="01:06:37.070" style="s2">people were very impressed by the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.150" end="01:06:39.140" style="s2">last question I would love your</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.070" end="01:06:44.210" style="s2">perspective on is another thing that</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.140" end="01:06:46.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve got is wonderful it&#39;s it&#39;s number</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.210" end="01:06:48.830" style="s2">somehow related to the notion of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.550" end="01:06:51.310" style="s2">like this idea of the co-presence of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.830" end="01:06:54.470" style="s2">past and the future in the now I</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.310" end="01:06:57.410" style="s2">recently learned from a Maori elder um</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.470" end="01:07:00.410" style="s2">that the maari&#39;s have a concept of time</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.410" end="01:07:05.170" style="s2">which is called wha and that there is</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.410" end="01:07:11.090" style="s2">basically that that the potential of</p>

<p begin="01:07:11.090" end="01:07:15.170" style="s2">it the reap a turning which then</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.250" end="01:07:20.330" style="s2">manifests as a future is happening in</p>

<p begin="01:07:20.330" end="01:07:27.710" style="s2">to that is that in in the Western world</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.240" end="01:07:29.960" style="s2">we have this bizarre false dualism</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.710" end="01:07:32.210" style="s2">between so many things like humanity and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.960" end="01:07:34.940" style="s2">nature self and world mind and matter</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.210" end="01:07:38.570" style="s2">and one of the the other really bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.940" end="01:07:40.700" style="s2">falls dualism that sabotages us is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.570" end="01:07:45.970" style="s2">false dualism between theory and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.700" end="01:07:45.970" style="s2">practice that that seems to suggest that</p>

<p begin="01:07:49.000" end="01:07:56.260" style="s2">has absolutely zero agency in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.240" end="01:08:00.070" style="s2">universe until we form an action plan</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.260" end="01:08:03.040" style="s2">and then go out and implement whatever</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.070" end="01:08:06.760" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided the actions should be and</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.040" end="01:08:11.350" style="s2">the outcome should be but if everything</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.760" end="01:08:13.150" style="s2">is non locally connected and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.350" end="01:08:14.500" style="s2">much more dynamic relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.150" end="01:08:16.299" style="s2">consciousness and matter and</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.500" end="01:08:20.400" style="s2">consciousness is possibly primary in</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.750" end="01:09:12.880" style="s2">lives really makes you wonder about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.339" end="01:09:15.220" style="s2">nature of time and Dean Radin spot real</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.880" end="01:09:17.140" style="s2">magic he&#39;s working on another one I have</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.140" end="01:09:26.380" style="s2">in hearing from you his discussion of</p>

<p begin="01:09:26.380" end="01:09:34.900" style="s2">real scientist now he&#39;s in the lab no</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.650" end="01:09:36.779" style="s2">bullshit for him but yes so he&#39;s finding</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.900" end="01:09:39.910" style="s2">an interesting guy can get his attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.779" end="01:09:43.029" style="s2">he&#39;s not an academic and he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.910" end="01:09:45.609" style="s2">reclusive but he&#39;s very rigorous in his</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.029" end="01:09:47.940" style="s2">sinking but I did finally remember the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.609" end="01:09:51.370" style="s2">guy was trying to tell you the physicist</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.940" end="01:09:55.240" style="s2">ilya prigogine of course we&#39;ve heard of</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.370" end="01:10:01.060" style="s2">it yeah what yeah and he</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.240" end="01:10:07.060" style="s2">he his concept of time is based on</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.060" end="01:10:11.010" style="s2">process in which you know it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.060" end="01:10:15.430" style="s2">dissolving of the sugar cube things</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.010" end="01:10:16.990" style="s2">scattered disorder increases in some way</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.430" end="01:10:19.300" style="s2">he&#39;s not one of the people that argued</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.990" end="01:10:22.480" style="s2">that we&#39;re all running downhill it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.300" end="01:10:24.370" style="s2">just that this process of change that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.480" end="01:10:30.450" style="s2">inherent and everything in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.370" end="01:10:33.460" style="s2">is the fundamental definition of time</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.450" end="01:10:36.730" style="s2">it&#39;s a definition of time that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.460" end="01:10:40.300" style="s2">Newtonian you can&#39;t run it backwards and</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.730" end="01:10:42.610" style="s2">it gives birth to all manner creativity</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.300" end="01:10:45.400" style="s2">so I don&#39;t have a listeners books in</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.610" end="01:10:48.180" style="s2">front of me now but you&#39;ll see that he</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.400" end="01:10:51.520" style="s2">and others that have worked with him</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.180" end="01:10:54.670" style="s2">let&#39;s say Illiad pretty much with a B</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.520" end="01:10:57.970" style="s2">books order out of chaos that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.670" end="01:11:03.370" style="s2">his book I&#39;m familiar with this way yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.970" end="01:11:05.530" style="s2">well there you know he used to be a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.370" end="01:11:08.920" style="s2">of the conferences I would come to were</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.530" end="01:11:12.900" style="s2">number them with the urban Lazlo so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.920" end="01:11:16.090" style="s2">heard him speak a number of times and</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.900" end="01:11:18.520" style="s2">he&#39;s very impressive you know this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.090" end="01:11:20.470" style="s2">not his main thing he&#39;s got something</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.520" end="01:11:23.560" style="s2">else he&#39;s very interested in well he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.470" end="01:11:25.660" style="s2">gone now but yeah this alternative you</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.560" end="01:11:27.850" style="s2">know time and there&#39;s a physicist been</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.660" end="01:11:29.350" style="s2">writing very nice stuff about it if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.850" end="01:11:31.690" style="s2">want me to follow up I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.350" end="01:11:37.090" style="s2">remember that I just can&#39;t think of his</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.690" end="01:11:39.600" style="s2">name right now if you do remember and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.090" end="01:11:42.040" style="s2">want to take another deep dive into</p>

<p begin="01:21:02.710" end="01:21:08.290" style="s2">and understand that technology should be</p>
