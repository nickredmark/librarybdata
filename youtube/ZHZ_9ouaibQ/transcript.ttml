<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:13.230" style="s2">I was listening to your chat with Tyler</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.269" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">Hollett</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.230" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">the other day oh yeah its discord and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">thought he was a very bright fellow and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">had a lot of interesting things to say</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">and it made me think I and and something</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been thinking about for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.180" end="00:00:33.270" style="s2">while that I thought might be a topic</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">that you guys could speak on quite well</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.270" end="00:00:38.940" style="s2">since you know Plato and Aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:42.629" style="s2">the Greeks so well and that is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.940" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">of a soul what is the soul and how do</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.629" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">how do we how do we have a soul in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">machine and I&#39;ve heard you talk and kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:54.629" style="s2">of redefine the notion of soul John and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:57.660" style="s2">does that seem like a topic that might</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.629" end="00:00:59.699" style="s2">be of interest yeah I am very interested</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.660" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">in discussing that I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.699" end="00:01:06.900" style="s2">discussing that in connection with with</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:14.369" style="s2">nauseous and dialectic very much very</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.900" end="00:01:16.229" style="s2">much so maybe I could start try I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.369" end="00:01:22.939" style="s2">been talking with Chris about this and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.229" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">trying to I guess what it&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.939" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">cover maybe it&#39;s a combination there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">the word I want to use and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.220" end="00:01:34.049" style="s2">exist in English Carrie makes use of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">in his book Augustine&#39;s invention of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.049" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">inner self which of course is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:40.439" style="s2">relevant to what we&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">about now the thing about that is Carrie</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.439" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">takes great pains to say that yet this</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">is English he wanted to use the Latin</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:50.310" style="s2">term inventio in that time yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">rien de the publishers wouldn&#39;t let him</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.310" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">because well they&#39;re publishers and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">reason you want I won&#39;t use we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">to use the word inventio is that it</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">hangs between our two words invention</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:09.690" style="s2">and discovery so this is where for</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">example you could get around a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.690" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">thorny problems in math by saying math</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">is neither in</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">vented nor discovered but it is in been</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:21.000" style="s2">tio</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:23.550" style="s2">so I&#39;m very interested then if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.000" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">allow me to reinvent EO I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.550" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">reinvent you the soul if that makes any</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:37.170" style="s2">that&#39;s sure and I want to try and do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:39.420" style="s2">something sort of the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.170" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">Descartes so for really important</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.420" end="00:02:47.760" style="s2">historical reasons especially to try and</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:50.370" style="s2">form a an alliance between the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.760" end="00:02:54.630" style="s2">Church and Neoplatonic magicians from</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.370" end="00:02:59.160" style="s2">the Renaissance baked art pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.630" end="00:03:02.180" style="s2">completely it identified the soul with</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.160" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">the self and then he completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.180" end="00:03:13.140" style="s2">identified the self with the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">center of subjectivity the the place</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.140" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">where the mind touches itself in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:19.140" style="s2">consciousness you know you&#39;re conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:22.769" style="s2">by being conscious it&#39;s pure</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.140" end="00:03:24.720" style="s2">participation and as always with</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">Descartes included deconstructing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.720" end="00:03:29.700" style="s2">Descartes you have to be really really</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:31.109" style="s2">respectful there&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.700" end="00:03:37.560" style="s2">insights there that should not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.109" end="00:03:40.950" style="s2">abandoned but that confusion of soul to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">self to subjective Center is something I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.950" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">would like to try and full of heart well</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">nevertheless keeping the connections and</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:55.230" style="s2">so so also the soul is connected in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">way with this notion of the divine</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.230" end="00:04:01.970" style="s2">double yes or the sacred second self I</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">think as you you&#39;ve renamed that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.970" end="00:04:06.660" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s very much the case I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">there&#39;s something in here that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.660" end="00:04:14.269" style="s2">term our soul is in is aspirational but</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:16.799" style="s2">I would also like like more does</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.269" end="00:04:20.039" style="s2">Christopher Moore does with Socratic</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.799" end="00:04:21.750" style="s2">self-knowledge and reconfigures reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.039" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">here perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.750" end="00:04:28.460" style="s2">thus the</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:30.650" style="s2">itself as something not possessed but to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.460" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">which we have a perpetual aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.650" end="00:04:36.380" style="s2">relation that your true self is is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">the virtuous self that you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.380" end="00:04:41.450" style="s2">aspiring to right so the soul is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">something we have something we do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.450" end="00:04:45.500" style="s2">something we it&#39;s an activity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">something inspired to become at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.500" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">time so what I think it&#39;s what the soul</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:53.720" style="s2">this is an idea I&#39;m playing with serious</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:57.020" style="s2">play and I&#39;ve been playing with</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.720" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2">Christopher ease when my best purse one</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.020" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">of the best people to play with as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:05.419" style="s2">can imagine this idea of I just have</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:07.880" style="s2">this image of you guys in the playground</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.419" end="00:05:12.380" style="s2">with marbles yeah yeah great great play</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.880" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">Nathan a play date yeah although I may</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.380" end="00:05:21.290" style="s2">have lost a few of my marbles um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:23.720" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to pick up on this notion</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.290" end="00:05:27.710" style="s2">that could resonate with Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.720" end="00:05:30.169" style="s2">ideas of the one within us which I can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.710" end="00:05:32.620" style="s2">perhaps get to and then Buddhist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.169" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">about the no self and the true self</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.620" end="00:05:38.390" style="s2">especially in the work of nishitani</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:41.979" style="s2">and and so what I&#39;m gonna what I&#39;m sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:41.979" style="s2">of playing with is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:51.200" style="s2">there&#39;s two ways in which we participate</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:56.660" style="s2">in a kind of transcendence one is to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.200" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">coupled to well put it this way the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.660" end="00:06:00.169" style="s2">emergence of mind is wedded to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:01.760" style="s2">emergence of world and I don&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.169" end="00:06:04.220" style="s2">emergence of thought I mean the emerge</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.760" end="00:06:06.380" style="s2">the way what the way your mind has</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.220" end="00:06:08.090" style="s2">emerged developmentally the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.380" end="00:06:11.660" style="s2">mine and the emergence of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.090" end="00:06:14.300" style="s2">an increasingly complex of complex and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.660" end="00:06:18.380" style="s2">dynamic set of intelligible affordances</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.300" end="00:06:20.330" style="s2">for affinity and aspiration so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.380" end="00:06:22.910" style="s2">to use the way and what that does is</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.330" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">that couples us to be inexhaustible the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.910" end="00:06:27.350" style="s2">morning not just quantitatively but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:31.130" style="s2">qualitatively but there&#39;s also that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.350" end="00:06:36.949" style="s2">about us which I want to use a Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.130" end="00:06:39.659" style="s2">term which is our suchness it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.949" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">if this direction is the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.659" end="00:06:44.699" style="s2">participation the more nests the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:46.889" style="s2">movement into more nests this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.699" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">suchness is the breeze the direction</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.889" end="00:06:55.729" style="s2">towards individuation and the suchness</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:58.919" style="s2">is that about you that is resolutely non</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.729" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">categorical that would that it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.919" end="00:07:03.599" style="s2">what you love in a person which you love</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:04.710" style="s2">the their uniqueness and i want i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.599" end="00:07:06.870" style="s2">like that term because it&#39;s so bound up</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.710" end="00:07:10.469" style="s2">with narcissism but when you pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.870" end="00:07:14.280" style="s2">the irreplaceable way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.469" end="00:07:16.650" style="s2">person can is and continues to be a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.280" end="00:07:19.349" style="s2">venue and you get a sense of oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.650" end="00:07:21.330" style="s2">right that that&#39;s the suchness now the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.349" end="00:07:23.250" style="s2">buddhist claim that enlightenment is you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.330" end="00:07:30.469" style="s2">get such nice for everything it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.250" end="00:07:39.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of tailoring your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.469" end="00:07:41.580" style="s2">to the being mode in everything and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.750" end="00:07:44.460" style="s2">what i&#39;m playing with is this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.580" end="00:07:46.770" style="s2">though the individual the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.460" end="00:07:48.630" style="s2">this is right out of Tillich and Chris</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.770" end="00:07:51.509" style="s2">Wells tell you that this individual</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.630" end="00:07:55.259" style="s2">participation dialectic between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.509" end="00:07:58.590" style="s2">mourners and the suchness that activity</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.259" end="00:08:01.409" style="s2">is soul hmm between the morning and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.590" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">suchness yeah so you mean between some</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.409" end="00:08:08.430" style="s2">kind of let&#39;s say Eck excessive life and</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.730" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">the world and then the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.280" end="00:09:48.460" style="s2">side the resonant side is the fact and</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:54.290" style="s2">we experience the most in wonder and awe</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.460" end="00:09:57.080" style="s2">that the the world right the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.290" end="00:10:00.800" style="s2">discloses an inexhaustible nests that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.080" end="00:10:05.089" style="s2">always presencing through it and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.800" end="00:10:08.180" style="s2">soul is when those so what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.089" end="00:10:09.260" style="s2">do and you Chris probably sees this why</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.180" end="00:10:11.180" style="s2">you making use of Tillich&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.260" end="00:10:12.950" style="s2">individuation participation and talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.180" end="00:10:16.730" style="s2">about this a finding relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.950" end="00:10:18.680" style="s2">there&#39;s this mutual it&#39;s not reflection</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.730" end="00:10:20.960" style="s2">because the more earnest comes into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.680" end="00:10:24.950" style="s2">suchness and then the suchness right</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.960" end="00:10:26.930" style="s2">adds to the more ness of the world right</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.950" end="00:10:28.820" style="s2">oh it&#39;s great when you can get this the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.930" end="00:10:32.120" style="s2">handle of this vocabulary it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.820" end="00:10:33.740" style="s2">beautiful yeah and so what and of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.120" end="00:10:35.450" style="s2">this is deeply influenced with Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.740" end="00:10:37.490" style="s2">but I&#39;ll say one more thing and I&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.450" end="00:10:40.070" style="s2">it let Chris talk with what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.490" end="00:10:43.490" style="s2">to do and again I mean this respectfully</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.070" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">is I&#39;m trying to give I guess a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.490" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">non-theistic or secularized equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:52.280" style="s2">to what the soul&#39;s main function was</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:54.050" style="s2">which was to worship the soul&#39;s main</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.280" end="00:10:55.699" style="s2">function was to worship and Descartes of</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.050" end="00:10:59.809" style="s2">course left that transform</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.699" end="00:11:03.230" style="s2">finding to transcendence right he left</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.809" end="00:11:05.799" style="s2">that out and when he collapsed the soul</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.230" end="00:11:10.339" style="s2">into the self and then the self into the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.799" end="00:11:13.970" style="s2">unchanging center of subjectivity so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.339" end="00:11:18.379" style="s2">trying I&#39;m trying to reformulate</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.970" end="00:11:20.689" style="s2">reinvent eyo soul in a way that zaps</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.379" end="00:11:22.999" style="s2">Andry appropriates in a respectful</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.689" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">manner the soul&#39;s main function which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.999" end="00:11:29.209" style="s2">worshipped beautiful yeah before Chris</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:31.069" style="s2">speaks I wonder if the soul ever had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.209" end="00:11:33.529" style="s2">kind of fixed meaning if all of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.069" end="00:11:34.939" style="s2">terms kind of they have to be reinvented</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.529" end="00:11:37.369" style="s2">all the time otherwise they become</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.939" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">reified and they have been no longer</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.369" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">have any meaning well the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:45.290" style="s2">things can become rarified in this way</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">and ER they can be embedded in a myth us</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.290" end="00:11:50.839" style="s2">that stagnates and dies and has not been</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:53.359" style="s2">replaced by any new emergent mythos that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.839" end="00:11:56.809" style="s2">discloses new logos right and in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.359" end="00:11:58.519" style="s2">sense they&#39;re trapped within and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.809" end="00:12:00.769" style="s2">like Chris&#39;s metaphor of the dying star</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.519" end="00:12:03.079" style="s2">is so appropriate they&#39;re trapped there</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.769" end="00:12:05.179" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of stuck on the event</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.079" end="00:12:09.139" style="s2">horizon if I if I turn his dying star</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.179" end="00:12:11.989" style="s2">into a black hole other right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.139" end="00:12:13.489" style="s2">so think I think our notion of soul has</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.989" end="00:12:15.259" style="s2">been lost interestingly in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.489" end="00:12:16.819" style="s2">performing arts you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.259" end="00:12:19.309" style="s2">category of music and you know this much</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.819" end="00:12:22.100" style="s2">better than mine I do soul in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.309" end="00:12:25.779" style="s2">there was an attempt to reinvent eyo</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.100" end="00:12:29.629" style="s2">soul as a particular way of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.779" end="00:12:32.419" style="s2">connecting through into music yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.629" end="00:12:34.339" style="s2">exactly I mean you have to you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.419" end="00:12:35.209" style="s2">distinguish between music that has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.339" end="00:12:37.579" style="s2">soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.209" end="00:12:40.249" style="s2">yeah and music that doesn&#39;t have a soul</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.579" end="00:12:42.410" style="s2">I mean if you have a very fine fine here</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.249" end="00:12:44.749" style="s2">and the music that has it so I think is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.410" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">connected with that inexhaustibility and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.749" end="00:12:49.369" style="s2">the music that doesn&#39;t have a soul is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:51.459" style="s2">just a formulaic repetition of of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.369" end="00:12:54.019" style="s2">something you know it might be very</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.459" end="00:12:58.819" style="s2">performative it might be very salient to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.019" end="00:13:01.879" style="s2">use your term or and that and that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.819" end="00:13:04.309" style="s2">relationship that I&#39;m talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.879" end="00:13:06.980" style="s2">worship that individuation participation</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.309" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">tono&#39;s a dynamic tension creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.980" end="00:13:11.660" style="s2">tension</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:14.270" style="s2">that&#39;s very aspirational you are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.660" end="00:13:16.190" style="s2">participating in the sacred second self</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.270" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">well your individuating the current self</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.190" end="00:13:20.540" style="s2">and re individuating it andrey</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.730" style="s2">individuating it tapping into it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.540" end="00:13:27.050" style="s2">nice until you actually come to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.730" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">appreciate and become or asymptote</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.050" end="00:13:30.410" style="s2">towards the sacred second self mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:32.150" style="s2">beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.410" end="00:13:34.370" style="s2">Christopher I want to hear from you I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.150" end="00:13:36.440" style="s2">want to hear you sometimes I add to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.370" end="00:13:38.510" style="s2">riff riff one on somebody&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.440" end="00:13:42.440" style="s2">possibly to be added to that well I I</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.510" end="00:13:43.940" style="s2">guess yeah unsurprisingly what I say is</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.440" end="00:13:52.700" style="s2">just going to be a recapitulation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.940" end="00:13:54.260" style="s2">what John just said Chris I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.700" end="00:13:57.200" style="s2">courting contradiction by saying that no</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.260" end="00:13:59.090" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to say that that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.200" end="00:14:02.420" style="s2">pretty comprehensive I mean okay maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.090" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">I&#39;ll put it I&#39;ll try and put it what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.420" end="00:14:09.590" style="s2">did John I&#39;ll try and maybe put piffle</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:13.190" style="s2">II I to me that if I had to distill it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.590" end="00:14:16.550" style="s2">down as a working definition I would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.190" end="00:14:19.010" style="s2">that the soul when I what I understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.550" end="00:14:22.190" style="s2">soul to be is like the transitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.010" end="00:14:25.280" style="s2">property of the self that relates it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.190" end="00:14:28.970" style="s2">its own morna&#39;s I always come back to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.280" end="00:14:31.730" style="s2">thinking of soul as a I as a relational</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.970" end="00:14:33.350" style="s2">aspect which helps to dislodge the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.730" end="00:14:35.210" style="s2">notion that it&#39;s something fixed an</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.350" end="00:14:37.640" style="s2">entity fixed within time and space right</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.210" end="00:14:40.160" style="s2">if it has if it&#39;s fundamental nature is</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.640" end="00:14:43.400" style="s2">as a relational nature both expressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.160" end="00:14:45.350" style="s2">and impressive then its function in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.400" end="00:14:47.900" style="s2">very sort of Guardian way its function</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.350" end="00:14:51.980" style="s2">is as a relation to be cultivated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.900" end="00:14:57.800" style="s2">as a relation as the I&#39;ve sort of a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.980" end="00:15:02.150" style="s2">sort of like it is the intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.800" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">aspect in the orchestra of self that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.150" end="00:15:08.600" style="s2">bridges between the the suchness of its</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:11.330" style="s2">current composition to the morning of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.600" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">the yet unheard melody yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.330" end="00:15:16.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the true the transitivity to me is</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:19.640" style="s2">the property of the soul that most</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.520" end="00:15:21.290" style="s2">alludes its definition because an ended</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">that also explains it sort of multi</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.290" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">vocality and it&#39;s equivocal death</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:27.200" style="s2">clinicians right because it&#39;s if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.330" end="00:15:35.480" style="s2">keep trying to voice definitions on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.730" end="00:15:40.610" style="s2">that it continually bucks and eludes so</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.480" end="00:15:44.450" style="s2">so I think that the the as yeah when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.610" end="00:15:47.779" style="s2">think of the soul the best place to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.450" end="00:15:51.950" style="s2">start for me is to understand the soul</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.779" end="00:15:54.560" style="s2">as the expression of the existential and</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.340" end="00:18:15.890" style="s2">and then that the two poles of that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:18.410" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a disclosure of what the</p>

<p begin="00:18:26.120" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">on me to aspire to tap into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.960" end="00:18:34.700" style="s2">resources of my suchness what is often</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">called in Buddhism your original mind</p>

<p begin="00:18:52.910" end="00:18:59.480" style="s2">I think it&#39;s entirely appropriate that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.260" end="00:19:01.330" style="s2">deaf the definitions of faith and soul</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.480" end="00:19:03.740" style="s2">be understood coterminous ly because</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.330" end="00:19:06.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s almost as though faith</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.740" end="00:19:09.260" style="s2">faith isn&#39;t just is the described</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.260" end="00:19:11.270" style="s2">activity of the soul and so it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.260" end="00:19:15.020" style="s2">I think it&#39;s impossible to think of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.270" end="00:19:17.240" style="s2">in as independent dynamics I think once</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.020" end="00:19:19.330" style="s2">one is somehow a property of the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">so that the cultivation of soul</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.330" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">manifests in faith and the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:27.350" style="s2">of faith manifests in soul I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">appropriate to understand consistent in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.350" end="00:19:34.370" style="s2">that manner I I would say that soul is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:39.290" style="s2">the term for a power and faith is a term</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.370" end="00:19:41.450" style="s2">for the virtue that you know cultivates</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.430" end="00:19:49.860" style="s2">to virtue something I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.660" end="00:19:52.020" style="s2">about today also was the sanest word</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.860" end="00:19:54.210" style="s2">hurt you because in Peter Lindbergh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.020" end="00:19:57.330" style="s2">blog there was a big discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.210" end="00:20:00.690" style="s2">about virtue and and he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.330" end="00:20:05.429" style="s2">something like he made some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.690" end="00:20:08.010" style="s2">comment like he says he loves virtue</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.429" end="00:20:11.640" style="s2">more than he could love even a woman or</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.010" end="00:20:14.790" style="s2">his wife for all yep that kind of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.640" end="00:20:17.429" style="s2">that kind of that&#39;s what virtue means so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.790" end="00:20:22.440" style="s2">that seems to be related to faith as</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.429" end="00:20:26.010" style="s2">well yeah I mean so I let me try</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.440" end="00:20:28.679" style="s2">something that&#39;s close and related and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.010" end="00:20:30.630" style="s2">now may help visit um so I think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.679" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">reverence and here I&#39;m found following</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.630" end="00:20:34.380" style="s2">Woodruff because he explicitly argues</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:37.350" style="s2">that reverence isn&#39;t a feeling or an</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.380" end="00:20:38.790" style="s2">experience it&#39;s a virtue he&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.350" end="00:20:42.299" style="s2">bit less clear about what the virtue is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.790" end="00:20:43.830" style="s2">but his exert his examples and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.299" end="00:20:48.270" style="s2">allusions to the Platonic tradition make</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.830" end="00:20:49.799" style="s2">clear what the virtue is virtue is and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.270" end="00:20:52.290" style="s2">this is the other aspect of faith that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.799" end="00:20:53.790" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get it sorry reverence is</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.290" end="00:20:57.929" style="s2">the virtue that puts you into right</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.790" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">relationship to all right so that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.929" end="00:21:04.620" style="s2">are both excellently receptive and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.760" end="00:21:06.990" style="s2">excellently that&#39;s the disclosure and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.620" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">excellently responsive that&#39;s the demand</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.990" end="00:21:14.070" style="s2">to the experience of awe so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:18.330" style="s2">tap into the fundamental depths of its</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.070" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">transformative offering and so reverence</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.330" end="00:21:24.870" style="s2">is a virtue faith is by the more</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:28.620" style="s2">encompassing virtue the better you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.870" end="00:21:30.570" style="s2">right like I say that it alludes back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.620" end="00:21:32.850" style="s2">the notion of worship where we are</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.570" end="00:21:38.990" style="s2">trying to get into a comprehensive right</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.850" end="00:21:43.230" style="s2">relationship to the unfolding of of</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:50.970" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about faith that</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.990" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">means that we&#39;re not there yet we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.970" end="00:21:56.730" style="s2">haven&#39;t arrived yet it&#39;s a near knock up</p>

<p begin="00:21:58.260" end="00:22:03.090" style="s2">right and try to make this notion of</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.090" end="00:22:09.090" style="s2">says there it&#39;s coterminous inter</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.850" end="00:26:30.380" style="s2">something like Orban would talk about as</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.140" end="00:27:28.340" style="s2">Christopher I&#39;m just gonna say it also</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.450" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">means that that implicit within that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.340" end="00:27:33.080" style="s2">within the faithful relationship is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">capacity for the capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:39.050" style="s2">course you just find it John right</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.640" end="00:27:40.610" style="s2">because there&#39;s something there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.050" end="00:27:43.640" style="s2">something about a faithful relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.610" end="00:27:45.470" style="s2">that is necessarily unpredictable die</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.640" end="00:27:49.250" style="s2">think about the womb the womb with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.470" end="00:27:50.810" style="s2">view express that it always has a the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.250" end="00:27:53.150" style="s2">gnosis of the relationship always has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:56.630" style="s2">view to beyond the relationship and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.150" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s reliable</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.630" end="00:28:00.920" style="s2">enough to be to be to us to us to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.690" end="00:28:02.150" style="s2">absurdity right because when a</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.920" end="00:28:04.670" style="s2">relationship becomes so unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.150" end="00:28:08.870" style="s2">then it verges into absurdity but it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.670" end="00:28:11.090" style="s2">not so predictable as to become that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.870" end="00:28:13.490" style="s2">another kind of absurd Nurse Joy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.090" end="00:28:16.250" style="s2">right yeah but it&#39;s predictable total</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.490" end="00:28:19.820" style="s2">predictable miss is absurd and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.250" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">a sort of chaos engineering yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.820" end="00:28:23.180" style="s2">right that&#39;s the virtual engineering</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.080" end="00:28:25.100" style="s2">right you join us too between those yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.180" end="00:28:26.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s some think so the property so</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.100" end="00:28:29.150" style="s2">that the the property of faith in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.960" end="00:28:32.780" style="s2">relationship is that which keeps its</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.150" end="00:28:34.460" style="s2">poesis ongoing and real clinician right</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.780" end="00:28:36.350" style="s2">so that when you when you turn to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.460" end="00:28:38.390" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s why that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.350" end="00:28:40.850" style="s2">why faithful relationships are a font</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.390" end="00:28:43.780" style="s2">for existential renewal in some respect</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.850" end="00:28:46.059" style="s2">right because you find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.780" end="00:28:48.789" style="s2">and recollected anew and a faithful</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.059" end="00:28:50.620" style="s2">relationship precisely because in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.789" end="00:28:53.169" style="s2">intermediates the morning of the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.620" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">as well as the morning of yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.169" end="00:29:00.280" style="s2">so the the capacity for self coisa for</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:02.590" style="s2">the autopoietic evolutionary quality to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.280" end="00:29:04.960" style="s2">a faithful relationship is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.590" end="00:29:08.890" style="s2">that what makes it a font of an exhaust</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.960" end="00:29:12.669" style="s2">ability yes and notice notice how as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.890" end="00:29:16.419" style="s2">are participating in the other right</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.669" end="00:29:17.860" style="s2">hand right like Chris Chris said you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.419" end="00:29:20.610" style="s2">also internalizing the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.860" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">Ubik you individually your such</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.610" end="00:29:26.260" style="s2">necessities to internalize other people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">yes and this is what dialogo says I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.260" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">this is what des Louis does right this</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:32.380" style="s2">is a property of dialogo says precisely</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:34.750" style="s2">that by the revelation of value are so</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.380" end="00:29:36.460" style="s2">revealed and in your revelation that was</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.750" end="00:29:37.870" style="s2">more revealed and then the cycling that</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.460" end="00:29:40.780" style="s2">takes place is a consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.870" end="00:29:42.760" style="s2">opens the perspective of the diello goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.780" end="00:29:45.820" style="s2">to the to the to the sort of something</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.760" end="00:29:49.630" style="s2">like the ontological vertex that is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.820" end="00:29:52.210" style="s2">is available with it with now available</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.630" end="00:29:54.340" style="s2">by by virtue of in virtue I should say</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.210" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">in virtue I love that expression to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.340" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">back at all in virtue of that faith hmm</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:02.260" style="s2">there&#39;s something else that I was</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:04.539" style="s2">thinking about it is that as the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.260" end="00:30:07.570" style="s2">erotic aspect I was just going to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.539" end="00:30:10.299" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what and I in these</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.570" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">conversations often we&#39;re a bunch of men</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.299" end="00:30:14.710" style="s2">talking it seems to be there there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:16.380" style="s2">women involved as well and I hope more</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.710" end="00:30:19.390" style="s2">and more women get involved and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.380" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this invocation of the feminine</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.390" end="00:30:24.909" style="s2">which happens and then that seems to to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:26.620" style="s2">bring this conversation in the insole</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.909" end="00:30:28.750" style="s2">the conversation if I could if I could</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.620" end="00:30:30.549" style="s2">say so and I&#39;m not I know that Hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:32.470" style="s2">there I remember that the soul is</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.549" end="00:30:36.280" style="s2">feminine or the Holy Spirit is feminine</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.470" end="00:30:39.909" style="s2">in other languages it&#39;s it&#39;s masculine</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.280" end="00:30:42.190" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s inappropriate I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.909" end="00:30:44.860" style="s2">mean III think that way all the time in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.190" end="00:30:46.570" style="s2">terms of masculine feminine polarities</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.860" end="00:30:48.760" style="s2">but people seem to get offended when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.570" end="00:30:49.720" style="s2">well I I prefer the Taoist polarities of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.760" end="00:30:51.669" style="s2">yin and yang</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.720" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">because they are more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.669" end="00:30:55.910" style="s2">they&#39;re not limited to biological</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.620" style="s2">creatures and</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.910" end="00:31:00.080" style="s2">and then they also disposed us towards</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.620" end="00:31:01.400" style="s2">not getting overly politicized about</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.080" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">something important that we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.400" end="00:31:07.130" style="s2">about I was gonna bring up the I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">gonna bring up that connection because</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.130" end="00:31:13.640" style="s2">the more nests into such nurse and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:15.200" style="s2">when it sort of finds our individuation</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.640" end="00:31:16.910" style="s2">to participation when we get that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.200" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">appropriate tone ours that right</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.910" end="00:31:22.400" style="s2">relationship I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:24.320" style="s2">really the experience of beauty where</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.400" end="00:31:26.390" style="s2">we&#39;re and I want to bring beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.320" end="00:31:28.580" style="s2">Hans book on saving beauty and scara&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.390" end="00:31:30.590" style="s2">book on beauty I think a really really</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.580" end="00:31:33.140" style="s2">important works on reason it works on</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.590" end="00:31:37.700" style="s2">beauty because because what beauty is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.140" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">beauty is exactly like scary says you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.700" end="00:31:43.490" style="s2">know you come upon a beautiful tree and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:45.950" style="s2">there&#39;s two things you say geez I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.490" end="00:31:48.500" style="s2">realize trees could be like that right</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.950" end="00:31:51.140" style="s2">there&#39;s the more nests but then you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.500" end="00:31:52.910" style="s2">realize that this tree is somehow in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.140" end="00:31:55.940" style="s2">experience of beauty unique and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.910" end="00:31:57.920" style="s2">different from all other trees so right</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.940" end="00:32:00.290" style="s2">so the jury has a soul innocence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.920" end="00:32:01.100" style="s2">yeah the tree has a solar sets not in</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.290" end="00:32:03.800" style="s2">any animism</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.100" end="00:32:07.250" style="s2">I think enemy ISM is a for us an</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.800" end="00:32:11.330" style="s2">inaccessible mythos that that symbolize</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.250" end="00:32:13.370" style="s2">that correctly but yeah I I think in</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.330" end="00:32:15.860" style="s2">that sense it&#39;s a kind of animation</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.370" end="00:32:20.120" style="s2">where animation also means to set things</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.860" end="00:32:25.190" style="s2">into motion right so I think beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.120" end="00:32:26.600" style="s2">exactly that experience it&#39;s like most</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.190" end="00:32:29.090" style="s2">of the time we&#39;re doing relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.600" end="00:32:31.580" style="s2">realization because the goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.090" end="00:32:33.890" style="s2">produce relevance but sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.580" end="00:32:36.110" style="s2">relevance realization machinery is in</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.890" end="00:32:38.240" style="s2">the service of realization it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.110" end="00:32:40.280" style="s2">service of disclosing the more nests in</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.240" end="00:32:42.170" style="s2">to touch nests of everything it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.280" end="00:32:46.390" style="s2">service of beautifying the world and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.170" end="00:32:49.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of flip right where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:51.800" style="s2">you know the world though what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.460" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">trying to do is actually put myself and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.800" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">this is like the worship and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:58.280" style="s2">reverence I&#39;m trying to put my relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:01.280" style="s2">realization machinery in service it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.280" end="00:33:03.680" style="s2">not subjectively oriented I&#39;m putting it</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.280" end="00:33:08.450" style="s2">in service transductive ly through the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.680" end="00:33:09.920" style="s2">disclosure in beauty of you know how all</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.450" end="00:33:12.020" style="s2">over the universe</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.920" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">to have existed the way it did for this</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.020" end="00:33:17.450" style="s2">cop to be the way it is and to be here</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:19.910" style="s2">now the way it is and have all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.450" end="00:33:23.330" style="s2">properties that it has that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.910" end="00:33:26.810" style="s2">possibly grasp right here right now and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.330" end="00:33:30.370" style="s2">so and so this is in this again this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.810" end="00:33:32.390" style="s2">a notion of a beauty not of consumption</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:34.520" style="s2">consumption is the most primitive form</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.390" end="00:33:37.010" style="s2">of conformity I become one with</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.520" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">something by consuming it Plato talks</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.010" end="00:33:40.790" style="s2">about when you experience beauty the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:44.150" style="s2">conformity its you he says you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.790" end="00:33:45.410" style="s2">give birth in beauty the response right</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.150" end="00:33:46.490" style="s2">the part of the right relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.410" end="00:33:48.920" style="s2">Chris said is poesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.490" end="00:33:50.690" style="s2">I want to create I want to do more to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.920" end="00:33:53.510" style="s2">afford right</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.690" end="00:33:56.180" style="s2">more and more beauty in the world mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.510" end="00:33:58.010" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like beauty is like the like</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.180" end="00:34:00.800" style="s2">the it&#39;s like the physiognomy of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.010" end="00:34:02.630" style="s2">world&#39;s mourners it&#39;s what it&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.800" end="00:34:04.250" style="s2">mourners presents to us right the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.630" end="00:34:06.620" style="s2">countenance of the mortis is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.250" end="00:34:08.120" style="s2">what strikes us as beauty so gentle and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.620" end="00:34:09.800" style="s2">then you have word for this that I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.120" end="00:34:11.630" style="s2">I think you&#39;d like I&#39;m going to give it</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.800" end="00:34:13.850" style="s2">to you and see where I play it I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.630" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">in this self it&#39;s an interface where</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.850" end="00:34:17.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing hahaha you think we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:22.250" style="s2">face the world and we give it a way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.960" end="00:34:24.140" style="s2">facing us yes and all that yeah also</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.250" end="00:34:27.010" style="s2">picking up on the technological sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.140" end="00:34:29.450" style="s2">interface as that which finds and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.010" end="00:34:31.520" style="s2">conforms two things together so they can</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.450" end="00:34:33.590" style="s2">welcome you actually function together I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.520" end="00:34:35.120" style="s2">thought you might want to play with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.590" end="00:34:37.130" style="s2">I will play with that well I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.120" end="00:34:38.780" style="s2">entire it&#39;s also there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.130" end="00:34:40.429" style="s2">sort of a tongue-in-cheek way it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.780" end="00:34:45.130" style="s2">appropriate to this exact circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.429" end="00:34:47.630" style="s2">but exactly now is interfacing and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.130" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">cyka headed room oh I&#39;m just gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.630" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">that the the the the interface being</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:55.940" style="s2">beauty but there&#39;s also a nog leanness</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:57.650" style="s2">to the idea of interface as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.940" end="00:35:01.340" style="s2">like you need to have this technological</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.650" end="00:35:03.050" style="s2">barrier between us or something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.340" end="00:35:05.270" style="s2">that that&#39;s just a feeling I got when I</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.050" end="00:35:08.420" style="s2">when I heard the word yeah and exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.270" end="00:35:10.040" style="s2">that and so we&#39;ve got to get out I mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.420" end="00:35:12.230" style="s2">I want to bring back the face with an</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.040" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">interface listen why I brought up Tyler</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.230" end="00:35:15.830" style="s2">in the beginning because he was talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:17.630" style="s2">about this technological platform and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.830" end="00:35:20.030" style="s2">then I had two feelings about that I had</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.630" end="00:35:21.710" style="s2">one feeling about yeah a great lowing be</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.030" end="00:35:22.630" style="s2">creative and then a other feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.710" end="00:35:25.870" style="s2">like getting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.630" end="00:35:28.810" style="s2">clearly consumed by by this machine that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.870" end="00:35:32.610" style="s2">is just devouring all our creative yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.810" end="00:35:38.500" style="s2">yeah you know acts and potentials I</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.610" end="00:35:40.840" style="s2">think that&#39;s right but I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.500" end="00:35:42.940" style="s2">the technology is what it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.840" end="00:35:46.840" style="s2">sense I&#39;m sorry that sounds trivializing</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.940" end="00:35:50.950" style="s2">what I mean is it is a power that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.840" end="00:35:53.020" style="s2">not been coupled to virtue hmm there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.950" end="00:35:57.490" style="s2">nothing in virtue to pick up on Chris in</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.020" end="00:35:59.080" style="s2">which yet that we have decided you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.490" end="00:36:01.060" style="s2">how we&#39;re gonna actualize the potential</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.080" end="00:36:02.200" style="s2">of this you wouldn&#39;t want it to be avert</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.060" end="00:36:04.840" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t want a machine to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.200" end="00:36:08.290" style="s2">virtue either and in a sense that has to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.840" end="00:36:11.320" style="s2">be a uniquely well I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.290" end="00:36:13.450" style="s2">that I mean yeah I actually would rug</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.320" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">you the other way I think as we try to</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.450" end="00:36:16.540" style="s2">give them intelligence we better be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">giving them virtues of rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.540" end="00:36:19.960" style="s2">wisdom but that&#39;s another argument I</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.690" style="s2">think with what Tyler was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.960" end="00:36:26.200" style="s2">point out is what&#39;s happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.690" end="00:36:28.020" style="s2">discord servers right is a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.200" end="00:36:31.060" style="s2">powerful way in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.020" end="00:36:33.340" style="s2">appropriating the interface medium in</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.060" end="00:36:35.380" style="s2">order to do interfacing the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.340" end="00:36:39.250" style="s2">talking about it right now and in order</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.380" end="00:36:41.320" style="s2">to try and create the communities and</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.250" end="00:36:43.630" style="s2">the distributed cognition for the recall</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.669" end="00:38:32.039" style="s2">is appropriate because I think what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.369" end="00:38:34.439" style="s2">the presence of Phi Leah does is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.039" end="00:38:36.059" style="s2">essentially creates a matrix for the</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.679" end="00:38:51.630" style="s2">the functions of the dialogic practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.419" end="00:38:58.859" style="s2">insofar as it trains and tutors Phi Lea</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.630" end="00:39:03.630" style="s2">is that it becomes a kind of it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.859" end="00:39:07.169" style="s2">a way of performing the beauty of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.630" end="00:39:09.989" style="s2">erotic impulse in a way that it changes</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.169" end="00:39:12.499" style="s2">its it transforms it and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.989" end="00:39:15.719" style="s2">that the role of Phi Lea as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.499" end="00:39:17.759" style="s2">intermediary between the a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.719" end="00:39:19.469" style="s2">emergence of the erotic impulse and the</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.169" end="00:39:26.219" style="s2">that&#39;s why idea logos is focal and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.019" end="00:39:28.469" style="s2">think that&#39;s why they cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.219" end="00:39:30.269" style="s2">interpersonal what we might call what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.469" end="00:39:31.799" style="s2">have called the the horizontal dimension</p>

<p begin="00:39:34.469" end="00:39:38.099" style="s2">kind of thing that guy cultivates and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.969" end="00:39:40.649" style="s2">circling is so it&#39;s such a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.099" end="00:39:43.909" style="s2">starting point because what it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.649" end="00:39:47.639" style="s2">do is it seems to bound the arena of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.909" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">play in such a way that the air us</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.639" end="00:39:52.440" style="s2">becomes a parity like Xers</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:55.890" style="s2">that can then be molded and shaped and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.440" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">creatively directed to become the birth</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.890" end="00:40:00.540" style="s2">and beauty to become to become an agog</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:13.260" style="s2">so there&#39;s something really really</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.620" end="00:40:15.000" style="s2">central then about and and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.260" end="00:40:16.830" style="s2">will come out you know as this as this</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.000" end="00:40:18.150" style="s2">we work to refine this more and more I</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.830" end="00:40:21.120" style="s2">think it&#39;s going to become really</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.150" end="00:40:23.810" style="s2">essential to understand how this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.120" end="00:40:27.000" style="s2">sequenced and to understand how it how</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.810" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">you know what what the proper conditions</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.000" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">are in order for this to happen reliably</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:33.360" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s why there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:35.820" style="s2">about there&#39;s something about cordoning</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.820" end="00:40:41.730" style="s2">way then that it becomes a proper</p>

<p begin="00:40:44.070" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">it can be profoundly destructive and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.100" end="00:40:51.990" style="s2">it can feed it can feed and dilate every</p>

<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:42.810" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking of the religion that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.320" end="00:45:45.270" style="s2">not the religion yeah more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.810" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">religious almost the more we get into</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.270" end="00:45:49.590" style="s2">all these things and we find that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:55.020" style="s2">all these notions like faith and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.590" end="00:45:57.870" style="s2">worship and you know trance or really</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.020" end="00:46:00.330" style="s2">all about right but we also find virtue</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.870" end="00:46:03.510" style="s2">and we also find wisdom we also find</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.330" end="00:46:04.110" style="s2">rationality that&#39;s why I almost always a</p>

<p begin="00:46:08.460" end="00:46:14.070" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s so amazing about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:16.830" style="s2">is the way he weds himself any right to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.070" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">the other um Peter lets&#39;s commented on</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.830" end="00:46:21.360" style="s2">in the in the dialogues because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">tip-offs he has a suchness about him</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.360" end="00:46:28.350" style="s2">that allows him to reform himself to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:30.630" style="s2">anybody he&#39;s with right and he&#39;s a sort</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.630" end="00:46:35.579" style="s2">give birth but he also has this faith in</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.450" end="00:46:37.440" style="s2">the logos he is willing to follow the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.579" end="00:46:38.880" style="s2">argument and this white also requires</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.440" end="00:46:41.630" style="s2">the virtue of courage he&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.880" end="00:46:44.130" style="s2">follow the argument wherever it goes yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.630" end="00:46:46.140" style="s2">and it seems it always goes I was</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.130" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">reading Socrates this morning because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.140" end="00:46:50.490" style="s2">you guys I have for the first time I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:52.650" style="s2">reading him directly of course I&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.490" end="00:46:55.230" style="s2">him through other people and and the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.650" end="00:46:57.539" style="s2">last part of the chapter was you know he</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.230" end="00:46:59.579" style="s2">comes up to all these pseudo conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.539" end="00:47:01.470" style="s2">about things and then he suddenly he</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.579" end="00:47:04.589" style="s2">says well we don&#39;t know actually what</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.470" end="00:47:06.630" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about here the very end</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.589" end="00:47:10.819" style="s2">of the chapter I thought like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.630" end="00:47:10.819" style="s2">humor there that I didn&#39;t know there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.960" end="00:47:15.779" style="s2">person intended like thinking you had</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.190" end="00:47:18.390" style="s2">this grandiose understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.779" end="00:47:20.519" style="s2">something but really the whole point was</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.390" end="00:47:22.019" style="s2">that once you&#39;ve understood something</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.519" end="00:47:25.049" style="s2">you you don&#39;t know anything anymore</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.019" end="00:47:26.960" style="s2">you&#39;re at the beginning again or this</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.049" end="00:47:30.509" style="s2">gets taken up in the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.960" end="00:47:32.430" style="s2">practice so so the Neoplatonic universe</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.509" end="00:47:35.519" style="s2">in which is one at which thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.430" end="00:47:37.619" style="s2">the absolute pure oneness of the one and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.519" end="00:47:39.690" style="s2">then things emanate they proceed out to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.619" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">all the various multiplicities</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.690" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">instantiation and then everything right</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:45.869" style="s2">returns this is not a temporal process</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.819" style="s2">this is what&#39;s happening in ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.869" end="00:47:49.500" style="s2">the idea in dialectic is you&#39;re supposed</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.819" end="00:47:51.390" style="s2">to do that same thing you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.500" end="00:47:53.369" style="s2">project all of your thoughts all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.390" end="00:47:54.869" style="s2">their variations you have and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.369" end="00:47:57.809" style="s2">notice all the differences and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.869" end="00:47:59.519" style="s2">recollect and say yes but that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.809" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">projection and only and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.519" end="00:48:04.680" style="s2">recollect recollect back right and try</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:06.660" style="s2">and step back to what&#39;s deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.680" end="00:48:08.519" style="s2">what&#39;s affording all of the variations</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.660" end="00:48:10.200" style="s2">that&#39;s when you realize oh but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.519" end="00:48:11.400" style="s2">really know it and then you gather this</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.200" end="00:48:13.710" style="s2">is how you practice that like that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.400" end="00:48:15.569" style="s2">gather it back in and then you again</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.710" end="00:48:17.970" style="s2">project it out so that you externalise</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.569" end="00:48:19.650" style="s2">it you can come aware of it right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.970" end="00:48:21.299" style="s2">then you see all the variations on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.650" end="00:48:23.130" style="s2">and then you pull it back in it and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.299" end="00:48:25.140" style="s2">don&#39;t stop you just keep going back and</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.130" end="00:48:27.750" style="s2">forth because you&#39;re trying to get into</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.140" end="00:48:30.539" style="s2">conformity with how how how reality is</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.750" end="00:48:33.269" style="s2">unfolding in that constant procession</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.539" end="00:48:35.519" style="s2">and return and return and what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.269" end="00:48:38.069" style="s2">cool for me is that&#39;s exactly the main</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.519" end="00:48:40.349" style="s2">motion and artificial intelligence deep</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.069" end="00:48:43.109" style="s2">learning right you take some data and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.349" end="00:48:44.430" style="s2">you can compress out what&#39;s underneath</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.109" end="00:48:46.710" style="s2">them all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.430" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">and then you run variations from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.710" end="00:48:54.540" style="s2">see what sticks gather it back in right</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:56.640" style="s2">very it out projected out recollected in</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.540" end="00:48:58.710" style="s2">projected out recollected in and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.640" end="00:49:01.530" style="s2">how this that&#39;s what how these networks</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.710" end="00:49:03.450" style="s2">evolve their capacity to pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.530" end="00:49:06.030" style="s2">complex patterns in the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.450" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">what gives them their intelligence right</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.030" end="00:49:11.430" style="s2">right and then I guess I guess to then</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:13.560" style="s2">that that Neoplatonic process that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.430" end="00:49:15.720" style="s2">that Neoplatonic process beauty is</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.560" end="00:49:18.420" style="s2">really the kind of hypostatic emissary</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.720" end="00:49:21.990" style="s2">right that signals the realism of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.420" end="00:49:25.010" style="s2">process and and allows you to track and</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.990" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">follow it more yet perhaps more more</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.010" end="00:49:31.170" style="s2">more reliably allows you not to be stuck</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:34.230" style="s2">in your tracks somewhere yeah yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.170" end="00:49:36.990" style="s2">like it seduces you forward all the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.230" end="00:49:39.090" style="s2">so they&#39;re not you&#39;re not you know you</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.990" end="00:49:43.410" style="s2">just you don&#39;t fall asleep by the side</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.090" end="00:49:48.420" style="s2">of the road I think beauty is the mark</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.410" end="00:49:52.530" style="s2">of knowing by loving right right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.420" end="00:49:55.050" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s its point oh and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.530" end="00:49:58.850" style="s2">you know originally of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.050" end="00:50:03.630" style="s2">the the the identification was you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.850" end="00:50:04.890" style="s2">sure really sexually but of course what</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">you know what Chris has been describing</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.890" end="00:50:10.590" style="s2">repeatedly to great effect is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:12.330" style="s2">really doing is we&#39;re exacting that and</p>

<p begin="00:54:58.070" end="00:55:06.080" style="s2">around with this idea of something like</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.630" end="00:55:07.550" style="s2">Zen neoplatonism because to it the two</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.080" end="00:55:09.770" style="s2">would constantly undermine each other</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.550" end="00:55:11.750" style="s2">serve as n was trying to undermine</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.770" end="00:55:13.070" style="s2">itself all the time and you would say</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.070" end="00:55:16.270" style="s2">called the stink of Zen and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.570" end="00:55:19.340" style="s2">you become too religious and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.270" end="00:55:24.260" style="s2">Neoplatonism was always is always trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.340" end="00:55:27.340" style="s2">to do the same thing and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.260" end="00:55:30.590" style="s2">you know if we could somehow integrate</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.340" end="00:55:32.810" style="s2">them together like I say because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.590" end="00:55:34.490" style="s2">not if you&#39;ll allow me to play with the</p>

<p begin="00:55:42.020" end="00:55:48.500" style="s2">creative tension that would prove would</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.680" end="00:55:51.010" style="s2">keep well perhaps keep a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.500" end="00:55:53.869" style="s2">criticality for longer before things</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.010" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">everything eventually solidify right but</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.869" end="00:55:58.130" style="s2">maybe keep the fire of criticality</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:59.900" style="s2">burning a little bit longer oh yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.130" end="00:56:01.970" style="s2">I wanted to say about my discussion with</p>

<p begin="00:57:28.870" end="00:57:35.420" style="s2">talking about our incapacity for love</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.120" end="00:57:37.310" style="s2">now our denial for love in the way in</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.420" end="00:57:38.690" style="s2">which we have turned everything</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.310" end="00:57:41.060" style="s2">to consumption and commodified</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.690" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">everything and he also has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.060" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">a correlated thing was that this allows</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:48.800" style="s2">us to circle back because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:50.750" style="s2">love and beauty are bound together he</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.800" end="00:57:54.790" style="s2">has this wonderful chapter where he</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.750" end="00:57:57.530" style="s2">talks about the aesthetics of the smooth</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.790" end="00:58:01.790" style="s2">yeah that we want we want this like we</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.530" end="00:58:04.510" style="s2">want we we have we have re identified</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.790" end="00:58:08.060" style="s2">but his point is we have misidentified</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.510" end="00:58:09.170" style="s2">beauty with with making things as smooth</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.060" end="00:58:12.650" style="s2">as possible</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.170" end="00:58:15.590" style="s2">visually cognitively interpersonally and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.650" end="00:58:18.080" style="s2">his point is that what we are doing then</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.590" end="00:58:20.870" style="s2">is is this grand act of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.080" end="00:58:23.900" style="s2">because what we&#39;re basically saying is I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.870" end="00:58:27.230" style="s2">don&#39;t want anything to disturb me or</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.900" end="00:58:28.970" style="s2">disrupt me and that&#39;s this comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.230" end="00:58:30.620" style="s2">your point that meditation I went on</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.970" end="00:58:31.850" style="s2">teaching them my meditation classes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.620" end="00:58:34.970" style="s2">doing them I don&#39;t know if you knew that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.850" end="00:58:37.160" style="s2">and I did I did I did yeah I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.970" end="00:58:40.180" style="s2">burdened otherwise I&#39;d love to come but</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.160" end="00:58:43.070" style="s2">no no no that wasn&#39;t that wasn&#39;t no no</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.180" end="00:58:44.900" style="s2">why I repeatedly tell my students you</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.070" end="00:58:47.180" style="s2">know that meditation is not a vacation</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.900" end="00:58:48.770" style="s2">it&#39;s an education it should disturb you</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.180" end="00:58:52.490" style="s2">and if you&#39;re having unpleasant</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.770" end="00:58:54.080" style="s2">disturbing feelings good good right the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.490" end="00:58:55.430" style="s2">people that come in and all they want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.080" end="00:58:57.470" style="s2">do and they want to talk about how they</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.430" end="00:59:00.620" style="s2">feel wonderful you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.470" end="00:59:03.440" style="s2">appropriate at times to celebrate wonder</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.620" end="00:59:06.140" style="s2">and connectedness and presence but you</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.440" end="00:59:10.010" style="s2">should also have periods where there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.140" end="00:59:12.830" style="s2">demand and challenge on you yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.010" end="00:59:14.630" style="s2">and I guess you also have to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.830" end="00:59:16.310" style="s2">underworld that&#39;s what this guy was</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.630" end="00:59:18.110" style="s2">telling me today about you know the poet</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.310" end="00:59:21.890" style="s2">has to go into the underworld and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.110" end="00:59:25.430" style="s2">look at the dark aspects of your of your</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.890" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">world and and and of yourself and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.430" end="00:59:29.030" style="s2">know that and that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">meditation which well but you see that</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.030" end="00:59:34.070" style="s2">the the you know the Gnostic and union</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:36.050" style="s2">metaphors are ultimately Wed to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.070" end="00:59:39.230" style="s2">Neoplatonic practice that I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.050" end="00:59:40.640" style="s2">about because what do you do well how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.230" end="00:59:42.200" style="s2">you really journey into the underworld</p>

<p begin="00:59:55.820" end="00:59:59.270" style="s2">and the point is that I&#39;m taking shadow</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.470" end="01:00:02.300" style="s2">not just and it&#39;s too hard to look at</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.270" end="01:00:06.620" style="s2">you mean it&#39;s it&#39;s you know no because</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.680" end="01:00:33.050" style="s2">right but trying to do that for yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.890" end="01:00:34.970" style="s2">is almost impossible when that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.050" end="01:00:36.680" style="s2">homework of wisdom where people can</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.970" end="01:00:38.510" style="s2">successfully do that and what you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.680" end="01:00:41.650" style="s2">to do and this is why and this is mores</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.510" end="01:00:44.360" style="s2">point about self-knowledge requires</p>

<p begin="01:00:55.970" end="01:00:59.660" style="s2">we can move that from being an</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.660" end="01:01:05.210" style="s2">to an explicit one like in therapy right</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.180" end="01:01:07.610" style="s2">only then can I recover from my</p>

<p begin="01:01:07.610" end="01:01:11.780" style="s2">inaccessible to me that&#39;s how I can</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.740" end="01:01:14.750" style="s2">integrate that which means individuate</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.780" end="01:01:17.270" style="s2">right with the shadow the shadow is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.750" end="01:01:20.120" style="s2">disruptive things that I have to project</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.270" end="01:01:21.320" style="s2">out so I can see them the way like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.120" end="01:01:24.020" style="s2">how literacy makes your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.320" end="01:01:26.840" style="s2">available to you and then I can from</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.020" end="01:01:28.520" style="s2">that gather back in and gather in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.840" end="01:01:31.150" style="s2">criticality and that&#39;s what actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.520" end="01:01:36.500" style="s2">individuate smiie and moves me forward</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.150" end="01:01:38.330" style="s2">hmmm III mean and this is what Jung</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.500" end="01:01:39.740" style="s2">thought I mean dreams are a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.330" end="01:01:41.720" style="s2">weird because dreams are sort of other</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.740" end="01:01:45.230" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of alternatives to your ego</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.720" end="01:01:46.250" style="s2">mind but it&#39;s very I mean this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.230" end="01:01:49.250" style="s2">the things you were you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.250" end="01:01:51.230" style="s2">Socrates Socrates spends a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.250" end="01:01:53.720" style="s2">putting people into a pouria because he</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.230" end="01:01:56.690" style="s2">wants to disabuse them of all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.720" end="01:01:58.730" style="s2">incorrect yet intuitively obvious ways</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.690" end="01:02:01.040" style="s2">of how we give self-knowledge well I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.730" end="01:02:03.260" style="s2">just introspect bullshit you will not</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.040" end="01:02:04.400" style="s2">get a lot of if most of yourself will</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.260" end="01:02:06.680" style="s2">not be found</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.400" end="01:02:10.010" style="s2">right oh well what I do is you know just</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.680" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">uh you know just the things I like or</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.010" end="01:02:15.790" style="s2">choose no that&#39;s bullshit too right well</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:18.260" style="s2">the things that I sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.790" end="01:02:19.460" style="s2">assent to well no that&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.260" end="01:02:21.830" style="s2">because I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.460" end="01:02:23.930" style="s2">committed to but the true normativity of</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.830" end="01:02:25.880" style="s2">you is until I see you having to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.930" end="01:02:30.800" style="s2">interact with things that disturb you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.880" end="01:02:32.690" style="s2">and disrupt you mm-hmm I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.800" end="01:02:35.000" style="s2">mores book is brilliant about this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.690" end="01:02:37.100" style="s2">just bringing out that there is so much</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.000" end="01:02:42.250" style="s2">aporia in Socrates because he&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.100" end="01:02:46.220" style="s2">to get people to give up our feigned and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.250" end="01:02:49.430" style="s2">fallacious sense of expertise about our</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.220" end="01:02:51.650" style="s2">own self-knowledge this is what we also</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.430" end="01:02:53.930" style="s2">lost with the notion of a soul if you go</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.650" end="01:02:56.690" style="s2">back into you know the Christian</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.930" end="01:02:58.910" style="s2">tradition the soul was deeper it was</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.690" end="01:03:00.770" style="s2">that part of you there was a God given</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.910" end="01:03:03.170" style="s2">part of you right it was that part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.770" end="01:03:04.940" style="s2">you that transcended yourself awareness</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.170" end="01:03:06.950" style="s2">because it was that part of you that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.940" end="01:03:09.490" style="s2">you know striving for relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.950" end="01:03:13.610" style="s2">what is ultimate God</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.490" end="01:03:15.920" style="s2">so I mean Socrates&#39;s process of aporia</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.610" end="01:03:19.490" style="s2">is to humiliate in the old meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.920" end="01:03:22.610" style="s2">the term people&#39;s pretended expertise</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.490" end="01:03:25.850" style="s2">which is a kind of arrogance right about</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.610" end="01:03:28.220" style="s2">their own self-knowledge because it has</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.850" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">to be found in dialectic I mean this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.220" end="01:03:31.850" style="s2">now the the convergence of this ancient</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:33.530" style="s2">argument that self-knowledge is only</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.850" end="01:03:36.020" style="s2">available in dialectic in this new</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.530" end="01:03:38.030" style="s2">modern argument by people like Sperber</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.020" end="01:03:41.410" style="s2">and my good friend Greg enric&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.030" end="01:03:44.180" style="s2">that right that reason if reason was</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.410" end="01:03:46.850" style="s2">designed by evolution to work within</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.180" end="01:03:50.330" style="s2">distributed cognition not just inside</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.850" end="01:03:52.850" style="s2">people&#39;s heads hmm that&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.330" end="01:03:54.620" style="s2">yeah so if you have a confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.850" end="01:03:56.270" style="s2">and I have a confirmation bias but they</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.620" end="01:03:57.110" style="s2">aren&#39;t the same confirmation bias you</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.270" end="01:03:58.490" style="s2">know what we&#39;ll do</p>

<p begin="01:05:05.839" end="01:05:08.359" style="s2">and then I realize there&#39;s a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.070" end="01:05:10.220" style="s2">thing because as I start to put stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.359" end="01:05:12.079" style="s2">out into the world I realize what that</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.220" end="01:05:13.700" style="s2">abandonment is it&#39;s those things are</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.079" end="01:05:15.890" style="s2">gonna take on a life of their own</p>

<p begin="01:05:20.180" end="01:05:27.170" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking again of this whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.180" end="01:05:30.170" style="s2">of Moses not getting to the Promised</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.579" end="01:05:39.470" style="s2">we have to deal with the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.589" end="01:05:43.369" style="s2">disappointment of where what will lead</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.470" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">to or or we have to give up our our you</p>

<p begin="01:06:03.170" end="01:06:08.540" style="s2">deeply but this is my deep critique of</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:13.160" style="s2">what goes wrong in the Platonic</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.540" end="01:06:16.640" style="s2">tradition which is the the conjoining of</p>

<p begin="01:06:38.990" end="01:06:44.210" style="s2">sees so there&#39;s no final resting point</p>

<p begin="01:08:08.000" end="01:08:11.780" style="s2">brings our open cup or something at a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.710" end="01:08:15.590" style="s2">broken cup because what does the crack</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.780" end="01:08:19.640" style="s2">do it reminds us being mode of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.590" end="01:08:23.120" style="s2">suchness of this right but at the same</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.640" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">time it&#39;s exposing us to how everything</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.120" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">right it&#39;s tapping into the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:29.180" style="s2">inexhaustible &#39;no speak of</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:31.160" style="s2">happens when I catch the suchness</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.180" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">because of the crop the cup is</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.160" end="01:08:35.480" style="s2">beautified and the more earnest of</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.010" style="s2">reality speaks through it&#39;s like Leonard</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.900" end="01:08:43.310" style="s2">light can shine in and also in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.120" end="01:08:45.770" style="s2">Japanese aesthetics they say that a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.310" end="01:08:49.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like a woman or a man who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.770" end="01:08:51.890" style="s2">beyond that prime that they consider</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.370" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">that to be beauty not yeah not something</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.890" end="01:08:56.410" style="s2">in its prime a perfection of life but if</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.839" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">somebody has gone just beyond the prime</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.410" end="01:09:01.670" style="s2">so that it contains life and death</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.120" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">within it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not this false</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.670" end="01:09:06.740" style="s2">promise of perfection yes excellent</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:08.930" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.740" end="01:09:10.490" style="s2">beautiful thing you just said and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.930" end="01:09:12.710" style="s2">notice how we can&#39;t talk about these</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.490" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">things without all of these all of these</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.710" end="01:09:23.620" style="s2">nodal terms coming up Beauty love wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.920" end="01:09:26.630" style="s2">faith soul right there&#39;s a particular</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.620" end="01:09:33.140" style="s2">particularly beautiful analogy to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.630" end="01:09:37.819" style="s2">made about the role of analogically the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.140" end="01:09:42.140" style="s2">role of silence and the V so you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.819" end="01:09:43.760" style="s2">one of the things if I can sort of use</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.140" end="01:09:48.370" style="s2">this metaphorically at least at first</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.760" end="01:09:52.790" style="s2">one of the things that happens in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.370" end="01:09:56.390" style="s2">disclosing dialog is that the silence by</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.790" end="01:09:58.220" style="s2">which you are heard deepens and</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.390" end="01:10:02.120" style="s2">appreciates the meaning of what is</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.220" end="01:10:05.810" style="s2">spoken now the silence in the margins of</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.120" end="01:10:08.600" style="s2">any given utterance is always infinitely</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.810" end="01:10:11.030" style="s2">greater and more engulfing than the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.600" end="01:10:13.190" style="s2">speech that&#39;s proffered into it so</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.030" end="01:10:17.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which that the silence</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.190" end="01:10:21.020" style="s2">is infinitely appreciative of sound but</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.210" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">sound also contains the presence of that</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.020" end="01:10:24.740" style="s2">silence right as though between the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:28.100" style="s2">notes of music as though between the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.740" end="01:10:29.690" style="s2">syllables of speech and so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.100" end="01:10:32.450" style="s2">things that happens I think when a</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.690" end="01:10:34.520" style="s2">relationship becomes loving and faithful</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.450" end="01:10:37.760" style="s2">and all of the ways in which we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.520" end="01:10:39.850" style="s2">defined it the silence of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.760" end="01:10:42.770" style="s2">relationship becomes more and more</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.850" end="01:10:44.750" style="s2">pregnant so you become accustomed to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.770" end="01:10:48.380" style="s2">speaking into the silence of the</p>

<p begin="01:10:48.380" end="01:10:52.220" style="s2">spoken in to that silence appreciates by</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.810" end="01:10:54.680" style="s2">virtue of the fact that it was spoken</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.220" end="01:10:56.820" style="s2">into that particular form of attentive</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.680" end="01:10:59.130" style="s2">silence and then when</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.820" end="01:11:03.810" style="s2">then when when that relationship becomes</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.130" end="01:11:06.150" style="s2">more and more knowing its particular its</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.810" end="01:11:08.070" style="s2">particular auditing silence becomes</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.150" end="01:11:09.659" style="s2">something that you can internalize more</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.070" end="01:11:11.670" style="s2">and more right which i think is in many</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.659" end="01:11:14.849" style="s2">ways what Augustine&#39;s project was with</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.670" end="01:11:17.579" style="s2">his confessions right he&#39;s speaking into</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.849" end="01:11:19.230" style="s2">the silence and to allow a silence that</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.579" end="01:11:22.440" style="s2">is infinitely knowing an infinitely</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.230" end="01:11:26.460" style="s2">knowable and so is hearing himself heard</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.440" end="01:11:28.860" style="s2">in the in in in the property of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.460" end="01:11:30.929" style="s2">silence and so it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.860" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">relationships going back to your</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.929" end="01:11:35.849" style="s2">relationship to the to the tension</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:38.190" style="s2">between such and more for instance that</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.849" end="01:11:40.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which the tension</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.190" end="01:11:42.239" style="s2">between such and more can be analogized</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.230" end="01:11:45.170" style="s2">by the relationship between sound and</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.239" end="01:11:48.300" style="s2">silence and a more encompassing of</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.170" end="01:11:51.179" style="s2">silence that the sound becomes the more</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.300" end="01:11:54.540" style="s2">the logos of it deepens deepens deepens</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.179" end="01:11:56.400" style="s2">and appreciates and so to me I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.540" end="01:11:59.130" style="s2">that that&#39;s a way of understanding both</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.400" end="01:12:01.889" style="s2">the dynamic the dynamic of the</p>

<p begin="01:12:01.889" end="01:12:07.770" style="s2">a as a symbol on for poetic love and</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.579" end="01:12:11.790" style="s2">it&#39;s self transcendence but also then</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.770" end="01:12:14.099" style="s2">its capacity to be interiorized as a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.790" end="01:12:15.389" style="s2">of performing the dialectic interior Lee</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.099" end="01:12:18.210" style="s2">because I agree John I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.389" end="01:12:20.730" style="s2">way in which we cannot we cannot self</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.210" end="01:12:22.230" style="s2">introspect reliably to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.730" end="01:12:24.659" style="s2">we can do so in a distributed fashion</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.230" end="01:12:26.130" style="s2">but then when the distributed dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.659" end="01:12:27.380" style="s2">becomes interiorized</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.130" end="01:12:29.489" style="s2">it does become a way obviously</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.380" end="01:12:31.380" style="s2">internalizing the sage as you often say</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.489" end="01:12:34.230" style="s2">it becomes a way of cultivating that</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.380" end="01:12:36.300" style="s2">practice it within the it within the</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.230" end="01:12:40.079" style="s2">confines of your inner life but I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.300" end="01:12:41.909" style="s2">that has everything to do with with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.079" end="01:12:45.060" style="s2">not as though you&#39;re just importing a</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.909" end="01:12:46.050" style="s2">dialogue and then running it on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.060" end="01:12:48.630" style="s2">thing the thing that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.050" end="01:12:50.929" style="s2">internalizing is not the speech made by</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.630" end="01:12:53.489" style="s2">the other person it&#39;s the particular</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.929" end="01:12:57.050" style="s2">comprehending ear of silence that they</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.489" end="01:13:00.690" style="s2">lend to your speech and thereby</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.050" end="01:13:01.829" style="s2">pronounced it&#39;s more nests ok I want I</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.690" end="01:13:05.099" style="s2">want a riff on that because that was</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.829" end="01:13:06.599" style="s2">beautiful the music I felt I felt two</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.099" end="01:13:08.699" style="s2">thoughts came to me and that was music</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.599" end="01:13:10.280" style="s2">and clairvoyance there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.699" end="01:13:13.080" style="s2">clairvoyance that happens but</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.280" end="01:13:15.570" style="s2">to people and musicians when they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:13:17.790" end="01:13:22.140" style="s2">them VOC both senses of the term</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.460" end="01:13:24.630" style="s2">articulation which is to you know to</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.140" end="01:13:27.030" style="s2">speak but also to break things into</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.630" end="01:13:29.910" style="s2">their parts right and what chris has</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.030" end="01:13:32.040" style="s2">just made me realize what she often does</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.910" end="01:13:34.680" style="s2">is the way in which the silence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.040" end="01:13:40.230" style="s2">internalized into the articulation of</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.680" end="01:13:44.640" style="s2">our intelligibility and and that the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.230" end="01:13:46.170" style="s2">aporia are those moments of that well it</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.640" end="01:13:49.080" style="s2">depends you have to have cultivated the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.170" end="01:13:50.880" style="s2">correct receptivity but aporia is those</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.080" end="01:13:53.130" style="s2">moments of silence in which you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.880" end="01:13:55.200" style="s2">appreciate the mourners that is beyond</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.130" end="01:13:57.000" style="s2">you right and it demands a</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.200" end="01:13:59.760" style="s2">transformation for you and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.000" end="01:14:02.460" style="s2">suggesting is one of the things we do in</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.760" end="01:14:04.350" style="s2">dialectic is we learn to seek those of</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.460" end="01:14:06.780" style="s2">Hori --is that articulate our</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.350" end="01:14:08.820" style="s2">intelligibility in just the way chris</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.780" end="01:14:11.370" style="s2">articulated they&#39;re just late articulate</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.820" end="01:14:12.810" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of an ticinese when asked</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.370" end="01:14:14.430" style="s2">because he didn&#39;t write the volumes that</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.810" end="01:14:16.650" style="s2">Plato wrote he asked what did he learn</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.430" end="01:14:18.630" style="s2">from Socrates and he said something and</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.650" end="01:14:21.480" style="s2">right he said well I learned how to</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.630" end="01:14:23.940" style="s2">converse with myself and everybody was</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.480" end="01:14:25.920" style="s2">kind of like what what he meant was just</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.940" end="01:14:28.739" style="s2">what Chris said you need so much time</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.920" end="01:14:31.830" style="s2">living with Socrates mimetic Lee right</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.739" end="01:14:34.110" style="s2">that he had internalized the circuit</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.830" end="01:14:37.500" style="s2">that&#39;s a Socratic process and he was</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.110" end="01:14:41.180" style="s2">capable now after only practicing it</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.500" end="01:14:45.870" style="s2">years in dialectic of doing it himself</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.180" end="01:14:49.350" style="s2">so dialectic is not just a social</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.870" end="01:14:52.530" style="s2">behavior it&#39;s also it&#39;s something you do</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.350" end="01:14:55.170" style="s2">you know you speak with God in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.530" end="01:14:56.900" style="s2">or look that&#39;s where you learn how to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.170" end="01:14:59.489" style="s2">have you learn how to speak with</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.900" end="01:15:00.300" style="s2">absolutely are by nature and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.489" end="01:15:02.640" style="s2">you&#39;re the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.300" end="01:15:04.590" style="s2">that&#39;s when arguably that&#39;s that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.640" end="01:15:06.840" style="s2">bets if if the process there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.590" end="01:15:10.260" style="s2">fruition that&#39;s that&#39;s it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.840" end="01:15:14.550" style="s2">epoch TASIS I mean the neoplatonism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.260" end="01:15:16.470" style="s2">all I think very implicit in Plato but</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.550" end="01:15:18.810" style="s2">the neoplatonist bring out those two</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.470" end="01:15:20.160" style="s2">dimensions very clearly in fact they go</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.810" end="01:15:21.930" style="s2">a little too far they tend to emphasize</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.160" end="01:15:23.700" style="s2">if you&#39;ll allow me the vertical</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.930" end="01:15:27.780" style="s2">ontological aspect</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.700" end="01:15:30.690" style="s2">of dialectic within you the the the the</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.780" end="01:15:32.040" style="s2">discourse with one&#39;s own soul right and</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.690" end="01:15:35.310" style="s2">that&#39;s how Flatow by the way define</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.040" end="01:15:37.980" style="s2">dialectic you know discourse with your</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.310" end="01:15:39.360" style="s2">soul right they tended to emphasize this</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.980" end="01:15:41.250" style="s2">but there was that&#39;s because they had</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.360" end="01:15:44.000" style="s2">they lived in a school and it was so</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.250" end="01:15:45.720" style="s2">taken for granted that the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.000" end="01:15:50.120" style="s2">right right</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.720" end="01:15:55.530" style="s2">we intrapersonal was embedded into an</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.120" end="01:15:58.370" style="s2">existential interpersonal yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.530" end="01:16:00.600" style="s2">a community both both are always there</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.370" end="01:16:02.580" style="s2">mutually informing and transforming each</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.600" end="01:16:04.350" style="s2">other Chris right and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.580" end="01:16:07.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that Socrates I</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.350" end="01:16:10.560" style="s2">mean he alongside the socialized</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.560" end="01:16:12.030" style="s2">dialogues in Plato Socrates I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.560" end="01:16:14.310" style="s2">think that&#39;s what&#39;s represented by those</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.030" end="01:16:18.150" style="s2">moments of reverie that Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.310" end="01:16:21.510" style="s2">famously has when he pauses for hours at</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.150" end="01:16:23.460" style="s2">a time to listen to his diamond right</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.510" end="01:16:24.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the end that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.460" end="01:16:26.700" style="s2">interiorized</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.510" end="01:16:29.970" style="s2">excitation of the socialized dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.700" end="01:16:32.160" style="s2">in the fall and the epic TASIS form that</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.970" end="01:16:34.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve just described yeah Socrates</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.160" end="01:16:36.000" style="s2">makes it clear that the examination of</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.170" end="01:16:37.860" style="s2">others the Socratic examination of</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.000" end="01:16:40.830" style="s2">others is always for reasons we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.860" end="01:16:43.650" style="s2">already articulated always always also a</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.830" end="01:16:45.900" style="s2">self examination in Socrates I forget</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.650" end="01:16:47.790" style="s2">which dialogue it is but he says you</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.900" end="01:16:49.560" style="s2">know after I&#39;m done talking with you I</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.790" end="01:16:51.120" style="s2">always remember that there&#39;s a man</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.560" end="01:16:55.400" style="s2">waiting for me at home that I have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.120" end="01:16:59.130" style="s2">talk to and that&#39;s his own soul yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.400" end="01:17:01.380" style="s2">yeah and then it kind of feeds back to</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.130" end="01:17:04.440" style="s2">though doesn&#39;t it because for for like</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.380" end="01:17:06.480" style="s2">the sudden that the the the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.440" end="01:17:11.540" style="s2">that Socrates carries on with his</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.480" end="01:17:14.340" style="s2">diamond also is what is also what</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.540" end="01:17:17.190" style="s2">indicates the Kairos of the socialized</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.340" end="01:17:19.860" style="s2">alloys and the point of his entry into</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.190" end="01:17:22.710" style="s2">those dialogues right he&#39;s guided he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.860" end="01:17:25.590" style="s2">guided all the while by his inward</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.710" end="01:17:27.450" style="s2">dialectic and and that&#39;s what that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.590" end="01:17:30.090" style="s2">think that&#39;s precisely what tutors him</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.450" end="01:17:31.740" style="s2">to guide the socialized dialect because</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.090" end="01:17:33.360" style="s2">effectively as he does right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.740" end="01:17:36.040" style="s2">like there they&#39;re two concentric</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.360" end="01:17:37.300" style="s2">circles running on one another</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.040" end="01:17:40.810" style="s2">yeah I think throughout the entire</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.300" end="01:17:45.160" style="s2">corpus I think that internal dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.810" end="01:17:48.910" style="s2">you know transforms the mind into into a</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.160" end="01:17:52.660" style="s2">so it&#39;s able to achieve a state in</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.910" end="01:17:55.300" style="s2">process that is in deep conformity with</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.660" end="01:17:57.390" style="s2">the states in process of distributed</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.300" end="01:17:58.510" style="s2">cognition and ultimately of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.390" end="01:18:01.540" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.510" end="01:18:03.340" style="s2">I think dialectic is ultimate because it</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.540" end="01:18:05.170" style="s2">is an act of love it&#39;s ultimately about</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.340" end="01:18:07.120" style="s2">transforming to yourself so you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.170" end="01:18:10.330" style="s2">more and more have the perspicacious</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.120" end="01:18:12.100" style="s2">capacity to enter into conformity with</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.330" end="01:18:14.430" style="s2">the logos and then through the logos</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.100" end="01:18:17.800" style="s2">into conformity with on toes with being</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.430" end="01:18:20.650" style="s2">that&#39;s how you get ontological you you</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.800" end="01:18:23.680" style="s2">know you you you you get into affinity</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.650" end="01:18:25.630" style="s2">with the logos conformity with it and</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.680" end="01:18:28.030" style="s2">then through the logos you get into</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.630" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">affinity with on toes with being mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.030" end="01:18:31.870" style="s2">I was think just thinking as you are</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:34.180" style="s2">speaking that it&#39;s this is very high</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.870" end="01:18:36.220" style="s2">conceptual stuff but also it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.180" end="01:18:37.870" style="s2">simple at the same time you know totally</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.220" end="01:18:40.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a conversation you&#39;re having with</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.870" end="01:18:43.030" style="s2">your wife or your children or or or when</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.990" end="01:18:45.850" style="s2">you know you you go for a walk and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.030" end="01:18:48.730" style="s2">look at it it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.850" end="01:18:50.740" style="s2">all this complexity of contents concepts</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.730" end="01:18:53.020" style="s2">it&#39;s just the seeing attune to reality</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.740" end="01:18:54.730" style="s2">right being it yes that is giel ability</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.020" end="01:18:57.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that Paul is keep</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.730" end="01:19:01.150" style="s2">looking for and there&#39;s a scalability of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.250" end="01:19:03.940" style="s2">this course that is scale that well</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.150" end="01:19:05.860" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly you know as soon as we</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.940" end="01:19:07.270" style="s2">are persons we are in discourse because</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.860" end="01:19:10.960" style="s2">we become persons through discourse</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.270" end="01:19:12.820" style="s2">right and so yes this is very in some</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.960" end="01:19:14.530" style="s2">sense it can reach up or reach down</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.820" end="01:19:17.050" style="s2">whichever metaphor you want into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.530" end="01:19:19.030" style="s2">very foundations of your fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.050" end="01:19:20.890" style="s2">framing of reality and how your being</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.030" end="01:19:23.410" style="s2">you know framed to reality and by</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.890" end="01:19:25.270" style="s2">reality right all of that it can reach</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.410" end="01:19:27.880" style="s2">to that as you said this very high</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.270" end="01:19:30.250" style="s2">conceptual stuff but it is practicable</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.880" end="01:19:32.190" style="s2">in the most and I don&#39;t want this to</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.250" end="01:19:35.530" style="s2">sound like an insult in the most mundane</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.190" end="01:19:36.730" style="s2">discourse that you can engage in mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.530" end="01:19:39.640" style="s2">this is what I mean about it being</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.730" end="01:19:41.920" style="s2">scalable because every disc like nobody</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.640" end="01:19:44.680" style="s2">has to be an expert in Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.920" end="01:19:46.810" style="s2">philosophy to have found themselves in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.680" end="01:19:49.210" style="s2">conversation that takes on a life of its</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.810" end="01:19:49.719" style="s2">own and takes all of the participants to</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.210" end="01:19:51.310" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.719" end="01:19:53.560" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t get you on their own</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.310" end="01:19:59.050" style="s2">everybody knows that everybody has a</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.560" end="01:20:02.770" style="s2">capacity to practice them all we are</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.050" end="01:20:05.410" style="s2">trying to do is articulate this more and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.770" end="01:20:09.550" style="s2">more and more theoretically but also</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.410" end="01:20:11.680" style="s2">with with practicable consequences so we</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.550" end="01:20:14.500" style="s2">can afford it&#39;s in I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.680" end="01:20:16.270" style="s2">enhancement it&#39;s exaptation because of</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.500" end="01:20:18.790" style="s2">our current situation and because of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.270" end="01:20:21.250" style="s2">emerging potential of this of these</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.790" end="01:20:24.250" style="s2">media and these new communities of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.250" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">practice we have to somehow exact</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.250" end="01:20:31.719" style="s2">ancient dialectic into the current you</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:34.780" style="s2">know into these current new communities</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.719" end="01:20:37.960" style="s2">of practice and this new medium of</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.780" end="01:20:43.180" style="s2">communication you know so it&#39;s an end</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.960" end="01:20:46.600" style="s2">soling process yes I say like to Seoul</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.180" end="01:20:50.410" style="s2">again and you know in that that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.600" end="01:20:54.699" style="s2">part of making no that&#39;s the wrong verb</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.410" end="01:20:58.920" style="s2">exactly the wrong word that&#39;s a big part</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.699" end="01:21:03.370" style="s2">of affording somebody becoming a person</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.920" end="01:21:07.570" style="s2">right that installing process and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.370" end="01:21:10.090" style="s2">it what&#39;s really interesting is I saw I</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.570" end="01:21:11.860" style="s2">saw Justin I sorry i souls not something</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.090" end="01:21:14.530" style="s2">we have of that we&#39;re born with a soul</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.860" end="01:21:16.660" style="s2">is something we become and solve through</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.530" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">through time through my like I like in</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.660" end="01:21:21.100" style="s2">fact I make you verb the way you have in</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:25.930" style="s2">a verb that picks up on like connections</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.100" end="01:21:28.930" style="s2">to embodiment and enactment yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.930" end="01:21:33.190" style="s2">think it is and so I mean this is again</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.930" end="01:21:35.500" style="s2">this is a way of trying to reinvent you</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.190" end="01:21:37.030" style="s2">some of the practices of theory on the</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.500" end="01:21:38.800" style="s2">ancient world were where they were sort</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.030" end="01:21:40.540" style="s2">of practicing sort of animating things</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.800" end="01:21:42.760" style="s2">and we look at thatmy go that&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.540" end="01:21:44.920" style="s2">magic and you know and I don&#39;t doubt</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.760" end="01:21:46.750" style="s2">that there was there was degraded forms</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.920" end="01:21:48.760" style="s2">of it in which it&#39;s weird magic but</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.750" end="01:21:50.680" style="s2">there are also really powerful forms of</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.760" end="01:21:54.130" style="s2">it because you know professed for</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.680" end="01:21:56.500" style="s2">example says that internal Theor G is</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.130" end="01:21:58.090" style="s2">way more important than external fear</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.500" end="01:21:59.590" style="s2">Jeff and what it was is about this</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.090" end="01:22:02.849" style="s2">process right</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.590" end="01:22:05.170" style="s2">like you said open souling things uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.849" end="01:22:07.630" style="s2">reanimating them setting them back into</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.170" end="01:22:11.439" style="s2">their proper motion the the you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.630" end="01:22:13.959" style="s2">psyche is wind blowing it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.439" end="01:22:17.079" style="s2">self moving thing when we when we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.959" end="01:22:19.360" style="s2">deeply remember sati how everything is</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.079" end="01:22:22.119" style="s2">suka everything is self moving how the</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.360" end="01:22:24.719" style="s2">logos is not just a set but a continual</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.119" end="01:22:27.400" style="s2">gathering and unfolding like that that</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.719" end="01:22:29.170" style="s2">reanimation so that we&#39;re constantly</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.400" end="01:22:32.229" style="s2">remembering the morning into the</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.170" end="01:22:34.479" style="s2">suchness that was also a big part of of</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.229" end="01:22:37.090" style="s2">this whole set of ritual practices that</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.479" end="01:22:38.889" style="s2">we dimly understand called fear Jia in</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.090" end="01:22:41.979" style="s2">the ancient world so you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.889" end="01:22:44.679" style="s2">always be practicing furia you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.979" end="01:22:47.860" style="s2">contemplation meditation reflection and</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.679" end="01:22:49.300" style="s2">fear Jia and and then that was also</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.860" end="01:22:50.499" style="s2">ultimately supposed to leave the theosis</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.300" end="01:22:54.670" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna become more and more</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.499" end="01:22:59.050" style="s2">godlike by doing it yeah I thought of</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.670" end="01:23:01.749" style="s2">the reanimating the death star again an</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.050" end="01:23:06.519" style="s2">image came came back to me again well</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.749" end="01:23:11.199" style="s2">the zombies as obvious is is the horror</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.519" end="01:23:13.510" style="s2">of of what reanimation looks like when</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.199" end="01:23:15.389" style="s2">it cannot be properly housed within a</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.510" end="01:23:18.039" style="s2">world view it&#39;s it&#39;s horrific</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.389" end="01:23:20.469" style="s2">reanimation right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.039" end="01:23:22.929" style="s2">reanimation is the wrong word I guess</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.469" end="01:23:25.209" style="s2">yeah in souling I like my word and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.929" end="01:23:28.300" style="s2">but so that&#39;s a way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.209" end="01:23:33.459" style="s2">is the zombie as a retro Resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.300" end="01:23:36.820" style="s2">without any installment sure I mean part</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.459" end="01:23:40.539" style="s2">of it I mean the difficulty with</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.820" end="01:23:43.780" style="s2">Darkness is you know it stands for many</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.539" end="01:23:45.909" style="s2">things as a term because there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.780" end="01:23:48.459" style="s2">in which the darkness is to the light as</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.909" end="01:23:50.320" style="s2">the silence is to the sound to that</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.459" end="01:23:54.639" style="s2">there&#39;s that sense of Darkness dichiara</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.320" end="01:24:00.430" style="s2">darkness yeah well yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.639" end="01:24:05.530" style="s2">and so yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.430" end="01:24:08.830" style="s2">but there&#39;s a sense in which a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.530" end="01:24:11.320" style="s2">what we might think of darkness is just</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.830" end="01:24:14.860" style="s2">the other nests of things and their</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.320" end="01:24:17.020" style="s2">capacity to disturb us and disrupt us</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.860" end="01:24:20.650" style="s2">now we can either resist that and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.020" end="01:24:24.160" style="s2">hardened against it or we can like Rilke</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.650" end="01:24:26.860" style="s2">was uncle is saying we can get an</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.160" end="01:24:29.250" style="s2">adoptive relationship to it so that it</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.860" end="01:24:31.450" style="s2">starts to disclose itself as beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.250" end="01:24:33.580" style="s2">beautiful doesn&#39;t mean comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.450" end="01:24:36.310" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean smooth I like that point in</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.580" end="01:24:38.110" style="s2">the Lord of the Rings where Galadriel is</p>

<p begin="01:25:46.960" end="01:25:59.800" style="s2">beautiful the idea of of beauty as</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.410" end="01:26:02.080" style="s2">something that necessarily that</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.800" end="01:26:05.770" style="s2">necessarily destroys and recreates</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.080" end="01:26:08.050" style="s2">yourself that if that that the roughness</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.770" end="01:26:10.300" style="s2">of beauty and also the roughly roughness</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.050" end="01:26:13.810" style="s2">of love is such that you cannot</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.300" end="01:26:16.060" style="s2">encounter it without being so changed</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.810" end="01:26:20.080" style="s2">and if you can encounter it without</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.060" end="01:26:23.470" style="s2">being so changed then it has been it is</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.080" end="01:26:26.320" style="s2">less than it is less than it is less</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.470" end="01:26:28.510" style="s2">than the fullness of its nature it is it</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.320" end="01:26:30.190" style="s2">is less than the fullness of love if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.510" end="01:26:32.800" style="s2">can encounter it without also being</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.190" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">transformed by it so there has to be a</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.800" end="01:26:38.410" style="s2">crack in everything you know there has</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:41.200" style="s2">to be like one of those things about</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.410" end="01:26:42.970" style="s2">Leonard Cohen is his voice became more</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.200" end="01:26:44.890" style="s2">beautiful when he lost his voice you</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.970" end="01:26:47.710" style="s2">know and same with a lot of singers who</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.890" end="01:26:49.180" style="s2">who have these broken voices somehow</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.710" end="01:26:51.400" style="s2">they&#39;re more powerful when they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.180" end="01:26:53.740" style="s2">broken or some aren&#39;t though because</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.400" end="01:26:55.840" style="s2">they left them at church yeah that Prime</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.740" end="01:26:58.000" style="s2">but they still have even the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.840" end="01:27:00.820" style="s2">are that are very pure whatever still</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.000" end="01:27:04.110" style="s2">have a unusual strange quality to them</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.820" end="01:27:07.690" style="s2">oh yeah they&#39;re not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.110" end="01:27:09.340" style="s2">surprising in some way right yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.690" end="01:27:13.270" style="s2">gonna say the neoplatonist picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.340" end="01:27:16.840" style="s2">what Kris just said really understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.270" end="01:27:19.300" style="s2">the process and this is like so of</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.840" end="01:27:21.520" style="s2">giving birth and the socratic is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.300" end="01:27:24.550" style="s2">Midwife and they talked a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.520" end="01:27:27.280" style="s2">that the the strain and pain of labor</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.550" end="01:27:29.800" style="s2">that goes into giving birth and that if</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.280" end="01:27:31.690" style="s2">you try to give birth and think about a</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.800" end="01:27:35.710" style="s2">Howell concept is ultimately based on</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.690" end="01:27:38.650" style="s2">conceive right if you if you try to give</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.710" end="01:27:39.700" style="s2">birth without the pain of labor you will</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.650" end="01:27:45.040" style="s2">have a stillborn</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.700" end="01:27:47.650" style="s2">entity mm-hmm which all right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.040" end="01:27:50.140" style="s2">profound yeah but it&#39;s also hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.650" end="01:27:52.570" style="s2">because yeah yeah it&#39;s also a hopeful</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.140" end="01:27:54.370" style="s2">thing because you can&#39;t avoid the pain</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.570" end="01:27:57.130" style="s2">of birth right it&#39;s nothing something</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.370" end="01:27:59.440" style="s2">that nobody even can avoid destructive</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.130" end="01:28:02.320" style="s2">pain indicates a pain is the real</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.440" end="01:28:02.890" style="s2">indication of the real potential of real</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.320" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.890" end="01:28:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what pain is it&#39;s it&#39;s it is your</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:10.930" style="s2">mortality taking you by the throat and</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.320" end="01:28:15.070" style="s2">let&#39;s remember that before medicine</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.930" end="01:28:17.650" style="s2">right before modern medicine in a</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.070" end="01:28:19.930" style="s2">quarter of births there was a death of</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.650" end="01:28:22.570" style="s2">the mother of the child or the mother</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.930" end="01:28:24.280" style="s2">and the child there earth was always a</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.570" end="01:28:24.850" style="s2">very dangerous thing in the ancient</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.280" end="01:28:27.310" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.850" end="01:28:31.270" style="s2">that&#39;s why midwives are so important</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.310" end="01:28:37.650" style="s2">because right they help to mitigate our</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.270" end="01:28:37.650" style="s2">mortality so that we can give birth hmm</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.400" end="01:28:44.500" style="s2">that&#39;s what dialectic is which is what</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.380" end="01:28:46.750" style="s2">inflex the process with its share of</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.500" end="01:28:51.220" style="s2">danger which i think is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.750" end="01:28:52.780" style="s2">not adequately appreciated about this</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.220" end="01:28:54.790" style="s2">process about the dialect to provoke</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.780" end="01:28:57.520" style="s2">philosophy in general because we&#39;re too</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.790" end="01:29:00.280" style="s2">comfortable is that it&#39;s dangerous and</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.520" end="01:29:01.720" style="s2">and you know and the Association of</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.280" end="01:29:04.630" style="s2">wisdom with danger I think is not</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.720" end="01:29:05.680" style="s2">intuitive for a lot of people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.630" end="01:29:08.350" style="s2">know that it would have been intuitive</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.680" end="01:29:11.140" style="s2">to me either before undertaking it let</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.350" end="01:29:13.260" style="s2">every instance of it risks a form of</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.140" end="01:29:17.800" style="s2">dispossession that is utterly utterly</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.260" end="01:29:20.110" style="s2">destructive and that is I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.800" end="01:29:23.190" style="s2">necessarily so just as just as love is</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.110" end="01:29:27.070" style="s2">just as love does and so I think that</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.190" end="01:29:31.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s darkness has to be properly</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.070" end="01:29:35.560" style="s2">manifest in order for its sabhi ntral</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.170" end="01:29:39.160" style="s2">promise to be fulfilled that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.560" end="01:29:42.160" style="s2">the dark night of the soul yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.160" end="01:29:45.700" style="s2">thought of this notion of sacrifice as</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.160" end="01:29:49.780" style="s2">well there was one thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.700" end="01:29:51.550" style="s2">talk to you guys about is the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.780" end="01:29:52.570" style="s2">sacrifice and the scapegoat and because</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.550" end="01:29:57.190" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about that</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.570" end="01:30:03.030" style="s2">having read their ending Gerard and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.190" end="01:30:05.410" style="s2">saw Satan fall as lightning yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.030" end="01:30:07.720" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.410" end="01:30:11.410" style="s2">big topic that&#39;s bad you can&#39;t get into</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.720" end="01:30:13.780" style="s2">right now but anyway what you said Chris</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.410" end="01:30:16.840" style="s2">struck me as quite profound but notice</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.780" end="01:30:18.550" style="s2">what we&#39;ve done cuz we&#39;ve enacted it we</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.840" end="01:30:20.170" style="s2">start with this notion of soul and</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.550" end="01:30:23.050" style="s2">notice how we we&#39;ve done all the</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.170" end="01:30:25.330" style="s2">procession if rejected it out right into</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.050" end="01:30:27.880" style="s2">all of these variations almost like the</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.330" end="01:30:30.040" style="s2">projection of sound and music right but</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.880" end="01:30:31.930" style="s2">we&#39;re also periodically which we keep</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.040" end="01:30:33.820" style="s2">circling back and gathering back and</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.930" end="01:30:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to find what is the thread</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.820" end="01:30:39.610" style="s2">running what is it the symptomatic</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.880" end="01:30:40.870" style="s2">thread that runs through all these</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.610" end="01:30:43.330" style="s2">projections</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.870" end="01:30:46.660" style="s2">and thereby I can retrace back to their</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.330" end="01:30:49.210" style="s2">origin originating source right because</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.660" end="01:30:51.700" style="s2">we haven&#39;t disclosed it fully of course</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.210" end="01:30:53.590" style="s2">we haven&#39;t but you know we&#39;ve enacted</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.700" end="01:30:56.530" style="s2">the very process I&#39;m talking about we</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.590" end="01:30:58.810" style="s2">cycle at we project out we gather back</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.530" end="01:31:01.690" style="s2">in and we&#39;re constantly doing this and</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.810" end="01:31:04.510" style="s2">we&#39;ve just done it all over Seoul now</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.690" end="01:31:06.970" style="s2">have we come up if you know what I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.510" end="01:31:08.830" style="s2">think we have a donation but are we now</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.970" end="01:31:11.230" style="s2">in a are we now in a more right</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.830" end="01:31:13.600" style="s2">relationship with the reality that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.230" end="01:31:17.050" style="s2">referred to by Seoul I think so I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.600" end="01:31:19.270" style="s2">so - yeah so I think I think that just</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.050" end="01:31:22.120" style="s2">the notion becomes more evocative it</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.270" end="01:31:24.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take any final form or structure</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.120" end="01:31:27.610" style="s2">or are certainly not any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.490" end="01:31:29.650" style="s2">certainty attached to it ya know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.610" end="01:31:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like we come within range of</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.650" end="01:31:37.750" style="s2">knowing by the light of that which we</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.810" end="01:31:40.930" style="s2">cannot define yeah III think I think it</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.750" end="01:31:45.820" style="s2">these things are always epic static for</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.930" end="01:31:48.070" style="s2">us we&#39;re always right we&#39;re always we we</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.820" end="01:31:55.840" style="s2">get at rejected sense of them in our</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.070" end="01:31:57.880" style="s2">constant trajectory towards them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.840" end="01:31:59.770" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful but notice what you</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.880" end="01:32:01.600" style="s2">have to give up you have to give up the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.770" end="01:32:05.500" style="s2">having mode the having mode is about</p>

<p begin="01:32:48.880" end="01:32:54.550" style="s2">calling the sense of being called and I</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.570" end="01:32:56.800" style="s2">feel a particular urgency</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.550" end="01:32:59.380" style="s2">how its impregnating me and impressing</p>

<p begin="01:33:33.520" end="01:33:40.450" style="s2">never question that in in what you were</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.310" end="01:33:43.050" style="s2">saying yeah I I just want to reassure I</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.450" end="01:33:46.720" style="s2">was trying to offer reassurance that I</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.050" end="01:33:49.540" style="s2">am trying to cultivate a sense where I</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.720" end="01:33:53.290" style="s2">am receptive to being struck by people</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.540" end="01:33:55.810" style="s2">my insight connection criticism and</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.290" end="01:33:58.720" style="s2">commentary that they give such that I</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.810" end="01:34:00.790" style="s2">will take it to heart if I have good</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.720" end="01:34:03.010" style="s2">plausible reason to believe it was given</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.790" end="01:34:05.700" style="s2">in good faith that&#39;s a standard I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.010" end="01:34:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a virtue I&#39;m trying to cultivate</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.700" end="01:34:10.600" style="s2">and multiple times in this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.320" end="01:34:11.950" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen me I&#39;m struck by what either</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.600" end="01:34:15.730" style="s2">one of you have said something it was</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.950" end="01:34:17.950" style="s2">like oh wow yeah well I&#39;d also also</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.730" end="01:34:20.950" style="s2">Chris has been much quieter in this</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.950" end="01:34:22.810" style="s2">conversation and part of me is like</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.950" end="01:34:24.580" style="s2">wanting you to speak more because</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.810" end="01:34:26.710" style="s2">because you have such a way with words</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.580" end="01:34:29.400" style="s2">on the other on the other hand I think</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.710" end="01:34:32.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a dignity at other times in just</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.400" end="01:34:34.060" style="s2">you know being present in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.470" end="01:34:37.810" style="s2">conversation and that adds something to</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.060" end="01:34:40.570" style="s2">the conversation as much as words would</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.810" end="01:34:43.030" style="s2">add to the conversation I think so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.570" end="01:34:44.590" style="s2">because I I mean well I was just gonna</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.030" end="01:34:47.290" style="s2">say Chris listens better than anybody</p>

<p begin="01:35:06.670" end="01:35:09.159" style="s2">why it was that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.809" end="01:35:13.919" style="s2">spoke of this art because you come back</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.159" end="01:35:18.129" style="s2">out of the silence right um yeah yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.919" end="01:35:21.280" style="s2">in like and you speak in virtue of it</p>

<p begin="01:35:25.119" end="01:35:30.879" style="s2">I think um because because to me</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.379" end="01:35:33.729" style="s2">identifying with the rhythm of the dia</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.879" end="01:35:36.609" style="s2">logos doesn&#39;t always mean being its</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.729" end="01:35:39.669" style="s2">voice right because because the</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.609" end="01:35:43.059" style="s2">listening ear is that to me like the DIA</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.669" end="01:35:46.269" style="s2">logos the DIA logos takes that the the</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.059" end="01:35:49.209" style="s2">various dialects and collapses them into</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.269" end="01:35:51.369" style="s2">an entity so that a listening voice and</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.209" end="01:35:55.089" style="s2">the sorry the speaking voice in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.369" end="01:35:57.939" style="s2">listening ear collapse into unity and so</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.089" end="01:35:59.559" style="s2">the unity of the list that the listening</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.939" end="01:36:00.939" style="s2">ear and the speaking voice is such that</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.559" end="01:36:04.209" style="s2">partaking of the rhythm of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.939" end="01:36:06.999" style="s2">conversation can simply be that can</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.209" end="01:36:09.659" style="s2">simply be being its form of silence</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.999" end="01:36:13.719" style="s2">being its form of listening silence and</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.659" end="01:36:16.989" style="s2">and you&#39;re right I I and I have this I I</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.719" end="01:36:20.039" style="s2">share your feeling and you of wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.989" end="01:36:24.209" style="s2">make sure that at any time</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.039" end="01:36:29.709" style="s2">this speech is offered that it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.209" end="01:36:31.959" style="s2">offered in that it&#39;s that it&#39;s tuned to</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.709" end="01:36:33.909" style="s2">the rhythm of the dialogue so that it</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.959" end="01:36:36.309" style="s2">contributes to the evolution of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.909" end="01:36:38.139" style="s2">melody and it doesn&#39;t interrupt it or if</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.309" end="01:36:41.109" style="s2">it does interrupt it and it interrupts</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.139" end="01:36:44.319" style="s2">it in order to pivot it meaningfully and</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.109" end="01:36:46.569" style="s2">not gratuitously so I like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.319" end="01:36:49.179" style="s2">so important to me the economy of</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.569" end="01:36:51.699" style="s2">dialogo this is really really important</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.179" end="01:36:53.349" style="s2">to me and and and because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.699" end="01:36:54.969" style="s2">something that has to be finessed and</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.349" end="01:36:57.399" style="s2">it&#39;s something you can you can get</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.969" end="01:37:01.510" style="s2">better at and you can get more more</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.399" end="01:37:04.419" style="s2">fluent in so I think yeah but reticence</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.510" end="01:37:06.519" style="s2">is not reticence is not reticence is not</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.419" end="01:37:08.559" style="s2">fear or trepidation most of the time</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.519" end="01:37:10.769" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s just wait it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.559" end="01:37:13.780" style="s2">waiting for the chaotic opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.769" end="01:37:17.649" style="s2">where the voice becomes an essential</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.780" end="01:37:19.989" style="s2">part of the dialogic evolution and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.649" end="01:37:20.289" style="s2">and they&#39;re in big dignifies itself you</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.989" end="01:37:21.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.289" end="01:37:23.830" style="s2">so you</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.400" end="01:37:24.970" style="s2">I got this powerful image out of this</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.830" end="01:37:27.760" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you were attending</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.970" end="01:37:31.000" style="s2">it you know this notion of the way the</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.760" end="01:37:33.010" style="s2">Greek chorus bears witness because in</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.000" end="01:37:35.680" style="s2">dialectic all the people that are not</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.010" end="01:37:38.380" style="s2">speaking are basically the Greek chorus</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.680" end="01:37:41.950" style="s2">varying witness in a reflective fashion</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.380" end="01:37:46.000" style="s2">and always poised to you know disturb</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.950" end="01:37:48.940" style="s2">what the speaker has done or or do like</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.000" end="01:37:50.890" style="s2">they&#39;re meant to call the speaker out in</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.940" end="01:37:52.870" style="s2">both meanings of the word they&#39;re men</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.890" end="01:37:54.700" style="s2">they&#39;re right here now and they&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.870" end="01:37:57.040" style="s2">and they&#39;re with us in a sense yes</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.700" end="01:37:58.330" style="s2">exactly exactly right and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.040" end="01:37:59.920" style="s2">playing on this notion of calling out</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.330" end="01:38:01.300" style="s2">when you call somebody out and that</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.920" end="01:38:03.100" style="s2">means you&#39;re trying to draw them but</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.300" end="01:38:05.680" style="s2">you&#39;re also calling them into giving an</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.100" end="01:38:07.390" style="s2">account right of themselves and being</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.680" end="01:38:10.900" style="s2">responsible like I&#39;m calling you out</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.390" end="01:38:12.160" style="s2">right and and so I mean that that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.900" end="01:38:13.990" style="s2">I understand the function of the Greek</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.160" end="01:38:16.300" style="s2">chorus and what I was hearing when Chris</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.990" end="01:38:19.660" style="s2">was I just got this image when he was</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.300" end="01:38:21.850" style="s2">talking about oh you know all the people</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.660" end="01:38:24.910" style="s2">participating for example in a dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.850" end="01:38:26.770" style="s2">that the the what&#39;s happening is you</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.910" end="01:38:29.170" style="s2">know momentarily this person is the</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.770" end="01:38:31.030" style="s2">speaker right in the Greek and then you</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.170" end="01:38:33.520" style="s2">all the other people are the the Greek</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.030" end="01:38:35.590" style="s2">chorus bearing witness and and people</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.520" end="01:38:37.960" style="s2">often it&#39;s telling that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.590" end="01:38:40.390" style="s2">understand the dramatic function of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.960" end="01:38:42.400" style="s2">Greek chorus in you anymore you know so</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.390" end="01:38:44.680" style="s2">Chris was I correct and picking up on</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.400" end="01:38:45.220" style="s2">that illusion III know I think so I</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.680" end="01:38:49.000" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.220" end="01:38:51.430" style="s2">because I think the chorus does I mean</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.000" end="01:38:53.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason that the traditional</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.430" end="01:39:01.150" style="s2">function of the Greek chorus is in part</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.380" end="01:39:02.680" style="s2">a a a wordless X well they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.150" end="01:39:04.150" style="s2">wordless sometimes they speak but when</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.680" end="01:39:06.640" style="s2">they don&#39;t speak they are a wordless</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.150" end="01:39:09.430" style="s2">expression of the dramatic irony that</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.640" end="01:39:12.610" style="s2">knows the circumstances of the plot</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.430" end="01:39:15.220" style="s2">beyond its own knowing so right you</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.610" end="01:39:17.530" style="s2">listen for like the Greek chorus here is</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.220" end="01:39:20.280" style="s2">everything that is not said as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.530" end="01:39:23.260" style="s2">to everything that is said and so they</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.280" end="01:39:26.620" style="s2">represent the form of proleptic knowing</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.260" end="01:39:29.530" style="s2">that sees the meta meaning of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.620" end="01:39:32.730" style="s2">narrative beyond the beyond the meaning</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.530" end="01:39:35.680" style="s2">that the characters are living right</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.730" end="01:39:37.989" style="s2">so the representation of that presence</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.680" end="01:39:40.120" style="s2">in a dialogue I think is very important</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.989" end="01:39:43.930" style="s2">because it hears and sees everything</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.120" end="01:39:45.610" style="s2">that is that is yet unsaid that is yet</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.930" end="01:39:48.130" style="s2">unspoken that has not yet been shown</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.610" end="01:39:51.520" style="s2">forth and so the presence the presence</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.130" end="01:39:54.760" style="s2">of that person shows forth the dia logos</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.520" end="01:39:57.760" style="s2">to patterns that it has not yet espoused</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.760" end="01:40:00.640" style="s2">just as the Greek chorus with their eye</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.760" end="01:40:02.170" style="s2">to dramatic irony can see the meta</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.640" end="01:40:04.450" style="s2">meaningfulness of the narrative that is</p>
<p begin="01:40:02.170" end="01:40:08.910" style="s2">not available to the characters that are</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.450" end="01:40:11.860" style="s2">being born out through it that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.910" end="01:40:14.650" style="s2">and it gives me a slight insight into</p>
<p begin="01:40:11.860" end="01:40:16.690" style="s2">why why we&#39;re doing this as well because</p>
<p begin="01:40:14.650" end="01:40:19.210" style="s2">we&#39;re not just doing this for ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.690" end="01:40:21.010" style="s2">or for some egocentric reason even</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.210" end="01:40:23.110" style="s2">though it might appear that like putting</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.010" end="01:40:24.730" style="s2">our putting videos on YouTube because</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.110" end="01:40:27.130" style="s2">there is these there is this chorus</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.730" end="01:40:30.060" style="s2">around us there is this multiplicity of</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.130" end="01:40:33.730" style="s2">voices that we are responsible to or</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.060" end="01:40:36.190" style="s2">that or that our I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.730" end="01:40:38.830" style="s2">articulated that no I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.190" end="01:40:41.860" style="s2">exactly right that&#39;s the weird symbol on</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.830" end="01:40:44.140" style="s2">of this medium and true like I mean</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.860" end="01:40:45.130" style="s2">think about well think about Socrates he</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.140" end="01:40:47.050" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to write anything down</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.130" end="01:40:50.710" style="s2">because he thought the permanence of</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.050" end="01:40:54.520" style="s2">text would write choke off the life of</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.710" end="01:40:56.739" style="s2">lo of logos right ma plate of course</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.520" end="01:40:59.320" style="s2">then I Rana CLE especially in a</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.739" end="01:41:02.890" style="s2">dramatically ironic sense when I had to</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.320" end="01:41:06.040" style="s2">write all these dramas but what we are</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.890" end="01:41:09.100" style="s2">doing is we are doing the the weird you</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.040" end="01:41:12.310" style="s2">know we are in souling speech here in</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.100" end="01:41:14.950" style="s2">via logos and it has that you know if</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.310" end="01:41:16.780" style="s2">effervescent but ephemeral quality of</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.950" end="01:41:18.700" style="s2">conversation but it&#39;s also being made</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.780" end="01:41:20.830" style="s2">permanent by recording we are donating</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.700" end="01:41:23.020" style="s2">together it&#39;s also a performance of some</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.830" end="01:41:25.500" style="s2">kind yeah absolutely yeah like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.020" end="01:41:28.330" style="s2">just we&#39;re talking to each other Oh</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.500" end="01:41:30.250" style="s2">kind of seems that way if I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.330" end="01:41:31.450" style="s2">taken up and have a life of itself</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.250" end="01:41:33.489" style="s2">beyond us</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.450" end="01:41:34.960" style="s2">normally when conversation ended the</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.489" end="01:41:38.380" style="s2">only life it had was in the memory of</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.960" end="01:41:40.840" style="s2">the participants now like text it will</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.380" end="01:41:43.570" style="s2">have a life of its own independent of</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.840" end="01:41:45.219" style="s2">our authorship and that means we are</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.570" end="01:41:45.760" style="s2">bridging between the two things that</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.219" end="01:41:47.950" style="s2">Plato</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.760" end="01:41:50.320" style="s2">is oppositional we are getting the</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.950" end="01:41:53.020" style="s2">permanency of text what we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.320" end="01:41:54.970" style="s2">the living breath of dialogue and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.020" end="01:41:57.580" style="s2">getting feeder because we need theater I</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.970" end="01:41:59.830" style="s2">mean this is what&#39;s missing in our</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.580" end="01:42:01.830" style="s2">culture as real theater and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.830" end="01:42:04.840" style="s2">is what almost what&#39;s compelling us to</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.830" end="01:42:07.480" style="s2">talk like this and I appropriate that</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.840" end="01:42:11.620" style="s2">that Christopher Christoph would use</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.480" end="01:42:18.160" style="s2">these theatrical metaphors because you</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.620" end="01:42:21.040" style="s2">know all of the life is a stage yeah it</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.160" end="01:42:23.980" style="s2">also I think fits the dialogic process</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.040" end="01:42:25.570" style="s2">with its share of danger we were talking</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.980" end="01:42:27.730" style="s2">before about the fact that you know in</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.570" end="01:42:29.280" style="s2">order to be changed by something at hat</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.730" end="01:42:32.350" style="s2">you have to you have to risk</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.280" end="01:42:34.420" style="s2">dispossession and you have to risk there</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.350" end="01:42:36.340" style="s2">has to be something deleterious about it</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.420" end="01:42:38.260" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s the public</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.340" end="01:42:40.840" style="s2">nature of it actually fits it with that</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.260" end="01:42:42.640" style="s2">quality because there is or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.840" end="01:42:45.040" style="s2">if you guys feel I still feel that every</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.640" end="01:42:49.030" style="s2">time I do one of these things I feel a</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.040" end="01:42:50.830" style="s2">sense a very pregnant sense of risk I</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.030" end="01:42:53.770" style="s2">feel a very pregnant sense of danger and</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.830" end="01:42:55.810" style="s2">to me to me that&#39;s essential that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.770" end="01:42:57.580" style="s2">essential I thinks if Sevilla said</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.810" end="01:43:00.130" style="s2">something very very eloquent about this</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.580" end="01:43:03.750" style="s2">too in terms of co-led that the public</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.130" end="01:43:12.190" style="s2">nature is what actually allows for the</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.750" end="01:43:17.020" style="s2">is what is what the the public nature of</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.190" end="01:43:19.060" style="s2">these dialogues is precisely what opens</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.020" end="01:43:22.120" style="s2">them to the possibility of dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.060" end="01:43:25.600" style="s2">quality because you have to you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.120" end="01:43:29.800" style="s2">we&#39;re walking and the knife-edge and and</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.600" end="01:43:33.580" style="s2">so the and and I think there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.800" end="01:43:36.010" style="s2">of there&#39;s some kind of artful balance</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.580" end="01:43:39.070" style="s2">or equilibration that some dialogues</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.010" end="01:43:41.470" style="s2">strike better than others depending on</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.070" end="01:43:44.230" style="s2">the amount of awareness that the</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.470" end="01:43:46.300" style="s2">dialogue accommodates of the witnessing</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.230" end="01:43:49.840" style="s2">presence of the chorus that sees it from</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.300" end="01:43:51.550" style="s2">without and and and every dialogue is a</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.840" end="01:43:53.440" style="s2">little different how each dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.550" end="01:43:55.840" style="s2">accommodates that presence is a little</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.440" end="01:43:57.880" style="s2">bit different some seem to kind of carry</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.840" end="01:43:59.290" style="s2">on almost heedless of it some are so</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.880" end="01:44:02.530" style="s2">hyper aware that that baby</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.290" end="01:44:04.690" style="s2">come so fraught with their their foreign</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.530" end="01:44:06.040" style="s2">owing sense of risk that they become</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.690" end="01:44:07.990" style="s2">almost inhibited by it</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.040" end="01:44:10.630" style="s2">but there&#39;s some something down the</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.990" end="01:44:12.970" style="s2">middle of those two and when that</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.630" end="01:44:17.350" style="s2">catches properly I think that the the</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.970" end="01:44:21.100" style="s2">fear of exposure risk by the perspective</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.350" end="01:44:22.840" style="s2">that sees this from without is part of</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.100" end="01:44:25.210" style="s2">what helps to insole it with its</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.840" end="01:44:27.700" style="s2">possibility because perhaps if you make</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.210" end="01:44:30.490" style="s2">yourself vulnerable as well and if with</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.700" end="01:44:32.710" style="s2">three our sincerity you also become the</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.490" end="01:44:36.280" style="s2">potential object for ridicule ridicule</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.710" end="01:44:38.140" style="s2">or the potential scapegoat totally</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.280" end="01:44:40.840" style="s2">totally but that&#39;s the virtue again</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.140" end="01:44:44.200" style="s2">virtue virtue is what steers you between</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.840" end="01:44:48.640" style="s2">the you know the vices of deficiency and</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.200" end="01:44:51.820" style="s2">the vices of uh you know excess right</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.640" end="01:44:55.840" style="s2">and and and I&#39;m thinking here that part</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.820" end="01:45:00.040" style="s2">of what the chorus does I mean the</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.840" end="01:45:02.320" style="s2">chorus so the the hero is on center</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.040" end="01:45:03.790" style="s2">stage the way the hero archetype is on</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.320" end="01:45:05.890" style="s2">center stage right now in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.790" end="01:45:08.470" style="s2">discourse and I keep trying to remind</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.890" end="01:45:10.420" style="s2">people that the her like if always needs</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.470" end="01:45:13.570" style="s2">to be counterbalanced with the hubris</p>
<p begin="01:45:10.420" end="01:45:15.790" style="s2">myths and I think that chorus often</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.570" end="01:45:17.740" style="s2">speaks the voice of the warning of</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.790" end="01:45:19.240" style="s2">hubris to counter that that&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.740" end="01:45:22.690" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in the tragedies to</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.240" end="01:45:25.810" style="s2">counterbalance right the heroism of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.690" end="01:45:27.760" style="s2">hero and and in you&#39;re supposed to you</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.810" end="01:45:30.130" style="s2">right the the hero especially the</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.760" end="01:45:31.960" style="s2">tragedy ultimately is defeated but right</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.130" end="01:45:33.400" style="s2">and this is sort of more of a Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.960" end="01:45:36.910" style="s2">and interpretation than an Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.400" end="01:45:39.490" style="s2">but the point is that the the the person</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.910" end="01:45:41.710" style="s2">who&#39;s partaking in right the drama</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.490" end="01:45:45.460" style="s2">watching the drama right actually gets</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.710" end="01:45:48.700" style="s2">steered between right hubris and an</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.460" end="01:45:50.860" style="s2">overblown heroism and right so they</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.700" end="01:45:53.530" style="s2">don&#39;t they&#39;re not a coward because they</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.860" end="01:45:55.240" style="s2">admire the beauty of the hero but they</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.530" end="01:45:58.420" style="s2">remember the mortality because the</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.240" end="01:46:01.900" style="s2">chorus speaks of hubris and we witness</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.420" end="01:46:03.640" style="s2">it&#39;s what we witnesses affects so I</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.900" end="01:46:06.640" style="s2">think there&#39;s something important about</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.640" end="01:46:08.650" style="s2">the way we have this invisible chorus</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.640" end="01:46:12.550" style="s2">around us right now because it really</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.650" end="01:46:15.160" style="s2">helps us cultivate a virtue in which</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.550" end="01:46:17.160" style="s2">a kind of courage where we&#39;re not hyper</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.160" end="01:46:20.680" style="s2">vigilant and they&#39;re therefore</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.160" end="01:46:24.280" style="s2">terrorized into timidity or we are just</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.680" end="01:46:27.370" style="s2">over blowin and just speaking in some</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.280" end="01:46:30.370" style="s2">reckless and heedless fashion mm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.370" end="01:46:37.030" style="s2">so the word that came to me is is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.370" end="01:46:44.110" style="s2">chorus keeps you humble humility but</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.030" end="01:46:45.820" style="s2">also also not not will it encourages</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.110" end="01:46:48.310" style="s2">that there&#39;s some part if you&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.820" end="01:46:50.170" style="s2">a chorus you&#39;re part of a grand story at</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.310" end="01:46:53.320" style="s2">the same time so there&#39;s this humility</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.170" end="01:46:56.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s this this this you know this</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.320" end="01:46:58.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.080" end="01:47:04.930" style="s2">dramatic grandiose but you&#39;re right yes</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.720" end="01:47:07.810" style="s2">yes excitement life or actually it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.930" end="01:47:10.540" style="s2">higher order of relevance it represents</p>
<p begin="01:47:07.810" end="01:47:13.900" style="s2">a higher order of relevance that then is</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.540" end="01:47:16.630" style="s2">that then is is is is gifted to the</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.900" end="01:47:19.810" style="s2">dialogue much very much I was going to</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.630" end="01:47:22.060" style="s2">say that in addition to the humiliation</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.810" end="01:47:26.680" style="s2">of the hero the chorus also honors the</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.060" end="01:47:32.710" style="s2">hero right it&#39;s right the chorus will</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.680" end="01:47:35.980" style="s2">often you know speak the the the some of</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.710" end="01:47:38.410" style="s2">the virtues of the hero so the the right</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.980" end="01:47:40.060" style="s2">I just want to say this because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.410" end="01:47:41.590" style="s2">want it I don&#39;t want to make a portray</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.060" end="01:47:44.050" style="s2">the chorus as just something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.590" end="01:47:46.690" style="s2">humiliating the hero the chorus also</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.050" end="01:47:48.610" style="s2">honors the hero the the chorus reminds</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.690" end="01:47:50.410" style="s2">us the course will often remind us of</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.610" end="01:47:53.440" style="s2">elements of the hero&#39;s path that had</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.410" end="01:47:55.690" style="s2">rendered him heroic in important ways um</p>
<p begin="01:47:53.440" end="01:47:58.150" style="s2">so I just wanted to nuance that a bit</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.690" end="01:48:00.820" style="s2">Andrew the chorus is doing that you know</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.150" end="01:48:02.730" style="s2">that presentation of hubris but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.820" end="01:48:06.460" style="s2">also bound up with a recognition</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.730" end="01:48:09.100" style="s2">honoring of the hero if so I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.460" end="01:48:10.180" style="s2">make it what I&#39;m trying to say here here</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.100" end="01:48:12.100" style="s2">this is what I want to say the</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.180" end="01:48:14.140" style="s2">relationship between the hero and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.100" end="01:48:16.540" style="s2">chorus is not adversarial its opponent</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.140" end="01:48:18.190" style="s2">processing Damona processing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.540" end="01:48:21.580" style="s2">process that&#39;s it&#39;s supposed to be a</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.190" end="01:48:22.900" style="s2">self-correcting process I wonder if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.580" end="01:48:25.180" style="s2">something like the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.900" end="01:48:28.270" style="s2">the individual instrumentalist and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.180" end="01:48:31.420" style="s2">doctor of the orchestra something like</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.270" end="01:48:34.980" style="s2">that yeah I mean a really good book on</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.420" end="01:48:38.680" style="s2">all of this how important this is is</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.980" end="01:48:40.720" style="s2">this book bearing witness to epiphany</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.680" end="01:48:42.460" style="s2">persons things and the nature of erotic</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.720" end="01:48:46.120" style="s2">life and he doesn&#39;t mean sexual</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.460" end="01:48:48.100" style="s2">eroticism this is John rusyns book</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.120" end="01:48:49.360" style="s2">he&#39;s also what&#39;s in Canada at least he</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.100" end="01:48:50.650" style="s2">did when I wrote this book and this</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.360" end="01:48:52.600" style="s2">whole notion of bearing witness to</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.650" end="01:48:54.100" style="s2">epiphany right which is bringing</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.600" end="01:48:56.890" style="s2">together so much of what we&#39;ve said and</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.100" end="01:48:58.750" style="s2">how it&#39;s so central a process bearing</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.890" end="01:49:00.430" style="s2">witness in this right way is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.750" end="01:49:03.460" style="s2">deep ways in which we in culture a</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.430" end="01:49:06.240" style="s2">people and within which we we turn them</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.460" end="01:49:06.240" style="s2">into persons</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.470" end="01:49:16.000" style="s2">so maybe the chorus is a person</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.450" end="01:49:18.340" style="s2">generating function I think Chris is</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.000" end="01:49:22.150" style="s2">right it&#39;s the it&#39;s an overarching a</p>
<p begin="01:49:18.340" end="01:49:25.900" style="s2">higher-order relevance realization that</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.150" end="01:49:27.940" style="s2">is yeah contributing to the cultivation</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.900" end="01:49:30.610" style="s2">of personhood yeah very much and it</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.940" end="01:49:32.920" style="s2">reminds us what it reminds us what what</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.610" end="01:49:34.990" style="s2">is essential what matters what what is</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.920" end="01:49:37.360" style="s2">alive and what is what is you know what</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.990" end="01:49:40.830" style="s2">is who abuse and what is what is false</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.360" end="01:49:43.750" style="s2">what is good faith and what is bad</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.830" end="01:49:46.840" style="s2">precisely precisely because it because</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.750" end="01:49:49.630" style="s2">it creates because it creates the bridge</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.840" end="01:49:52.450" style="s2">of continuity between the frame and oh</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.630" end="01:49:54.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a trans framing device right it is</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.450" end="01:49:57.190" style="s2">it is the continuity between what is</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.820" end="01:49:59.020" style="s2">enclosed within the frame in in this</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.190" end="01:50:01.060" style="s2">case the narrative within this metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.020" end="01:50:04.000" style="s2">and what is beyond the frame wall</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.060" end="01:50:07.840" style="s2">narrative so and and you&#39;re precisely</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.000" end="01:50:10.810" style="s2">right that the the the the the the most</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.840" end="01:50:14.140" style="s2">the most apt description of that</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.810" end="01:50:18.940" style="s2">continuity is precisely the relation of</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.140" end="01:50:22.110" style="s2">faith yeah that&#39;s good and then you get</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.940" end="01:50:26.400" style="s2">oh and I think what that does to invoke</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.110" end="01:50:29.890" style="s2">both both of your you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.400" end="01:50:32.650" style="s2">familiar with Catholicism that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.890" end="01:50:35.770" style="s2">tradition was supposed to be tradition</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.650" end="01:50:37.559" style="s2">was your faithfulness to the chorus that</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.770" end="01:50:40.449" style="s2">precedes</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.559" end="01:50:45.099" style="s2">it is beyond you and pronounces upon you</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.449" end="01:50:48.669" style="s2">continuously mm-hmm yeah there&#39;s a host</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.099" end="01:50:51.659" style="s2">or something of precisely well yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.669" end="01:50:54.459" style="s2">the liturgy you always invoke the host</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.659" end="01:50:56.949" style="s2">all the people not only all the people</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.459" end="01:50:58.929" style="s2">that are present visibly you invoke all</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.949" end="01:51:01.329" style="s2">the invisible people that are present</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.929" end="01:51:05.789" style="s2">all the salient saw all the saints or</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.329" end="01:51:07.659" style="s2">maybe all the angels and saints oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.789" end="01:51:10.059" style="s2">heavenly absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.659" end="01:51:14.979" style="s2">so you and also you so you come back to</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.059" end="01:51:18.880" style="s2">being in a cosmos again during a</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.979" end="01:51:21.669" style="s2">wandering fragmented you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.880" end="01:51:23.829" style="s2">person and then you you you you you find</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.669" end="01:51:26.559" style="s2">yourself situated in a mandala or a</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.829" end="01:51:30.550" style="s2">cosmos or in a world again to use</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.559" end="01:51:33.489" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s yeah I think so yes I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.550" end="01:51:36.969" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been struck us but Spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.489" end="01:51:39.989" style="s2">has this notion of you know we can find</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.969" end="01:51:43.119" style="s2">what he calls the face of the universe</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.989" end="01:51:45.579" style="s2">which is this sort of Gestalt thinking</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.119" end="01:51:48.369" style="s2">that allows us to enter into right</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.579" end="01:51:50.349" style="s2">relationship with it right and and so</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.369" end="01:51:52.119" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s doing exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.349" end="01:51:54.939" style="s2">we&#39;re back to the interfacing notion</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.119" end="01:51:58.479" style="s2">again yeah tradition is a powerful way</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.939" end="01:52:01.689" style="s2">in which we interface with with the</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.479" end="01:52:04.510" style="s2">universe and may and make it as you said</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.689" end="01:52:08.969" style="s2">make it cosmic for us as opposed to just</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.510" end="01:52:10.929" style="s2">a an empty set of stuff thrown together</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.969" end="01:52:12.789" style="s2">not an empty stare I&#39;m going to say a</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.929" end="01:52:15.130" style="s2">purely logic I&#39;m a did me an empty set I</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.789" end="01:52:17.289" style="s2">mean a purely logical eternally purely</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.130" end="01:52:19.919" style="s2">formal set as opposed to a logos the</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.289" end="01:52:23.229" style="s2">difference between a Death Star sorry</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.919" end="01:52:25.059" style="s2">eNOS you know a set is you can put any</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.229" end="01:52:27.729" style="s2">any things into it they&#39;re just bound</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.059" end="01:52:29.349" style="s2">together by the formal grouping but the</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.729" end="01:52:30.729" style="s2">logo says they things are grouped</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.349" end="01:52:31.239" style="s2">together so that they come to belong</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.729" end="01:52:33.789" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.239" end="01:52:35.919" style="s2">and then and thereby and thereby they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.789" end="01:52:37.479" style="s2">belonging to each other is how they can</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.919" end="01:52:39.369" style="s2">include you and you can participate</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.479" end="01:52:43.739" style="s2">their belonging to each other is</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.369" end="01:52:43.739" style="s2">precisely how you can belong to them</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.869" end="01:52:55.489" style="s2">I should get going guys back to back to</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.369" end="01:53:01.550" style="s2">the the the the world as it is the world</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.489" end="01:53:03.139" style="s2">as it is exactly do you have anything</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.550" end="01:53:07.099" style="s2">else to say</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.139" end="01:53:09.080" style="s2">Christopher P for Windus nope I&#39;ll let</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.099" end="01:53:12.139" style="s2">that be the final word okay</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.080" end="01:53:15.739" style="s2">well thank you so much that was amazing</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.139" end="01:53:20.540" style="s2">um thank you Andrew thank you for</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.739" end="01:53:23.030" style="s2">convening us and yeah it&#39;sit&#39;s great so</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.540" end="01:53:24.860" style="s2">we talked about the soul this time that</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.030" end="01:53:26.570" style="s2">was a that was the word I threw in the</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.860" end="01:53:27.199" style="s2">beginning and maybe if we do it again</p>
<p begin="01:53:26.570" end="01:53:30.199" style="s2">sometime</p>
