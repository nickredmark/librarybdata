<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">by like framing the situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">because from from my point of view there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">a lot of conflict around</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">what what a woman is who a woman is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">this to me seems to be an issue of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">the kind of symptomatic uh liberation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">a woman you know the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">intervention into our biology that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.040" style="s2">allows us to choose</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">our kind of reproductive condition we</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.040" end="00:02:03.520" style="s2">can move into the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.520" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">unprecedented conditions that have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">afforded to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">by the kind of techno-capitalist world</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">that we&#39;ve inherited</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">and it seems like in the culture we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">seeing the symptoms of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">with this uh very</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">you know contentious conversations</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:22.480" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">who is a woman who gets to be in women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.480" end="00:02:27.040" style="s2">spaces what is it to be a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">and also the contested kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.040" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">of that term to biology and to sex</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">and so i wanted to start off the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">conversation with that very base and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">basic question</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">and to kind of see what is your</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">diagnosis where do you start when</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">what is a woman sure</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously an</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">extremely kind of contentious and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">emotional topic and you know very</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">politically fraught and has been the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">subject of a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know often quite vicious um</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">arguments i mean i think my starting</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">point when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:03.360" style="s2">you know introducing this question is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">almost to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.360" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">in terms of a kind of recent history and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">to think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">this question almost generationally like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">generation x like born in the 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">you know and i think what i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen in in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">at you know and many other people&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">is a kind of fracturing of these terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:29.360" style="s2">in certain ways so i mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:29.920" style="s2">i think the second wave idea that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.360" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.920" end="00:03:33.440" style="s2">you know sexual difference and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:35.599" style="s2">were men and women</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.440" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">and that gender was this kind of social</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.599" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">force that was kind of negatively</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">imposed on the outside and it would kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">and it would be about certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">expectations that would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">attach themselves to sex as it were</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">right so the idea that if you were born</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">female then you were supposed to be this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">person and if you&#39;re born male 1</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">especially this kind of person you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.720" style="s2">and so gender was this kind of external</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">force but</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.720" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">sex wasn&#39;t kind of contested in the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">way as it was today it was just a kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">of fact a kind of brute</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">biological fact right you were born male</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">or female and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">but actually there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">existentialist dimension which was kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">like to say but that tells you nothing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">about how you&#39;re actually going to live</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">life you know it&#39;s up to you in a way so</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">i think the second wave</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">um actually had quite a kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">trickle-down effect</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">on the way in which that idea permeate</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">permeated</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">however uh gently in education and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">and then i think that kind of shifted</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">something kind of happened in the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">10 years and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">you know i wrote this book in 2009</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">called one dimensional woman</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">which which is just a kind of short</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">polemic really about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">consumer feminism and it was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">against the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:49.120" style="s2">capitalism seemed to be kind of trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">to integrate women into the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.120" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">and into this kind of capitalist subject</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">you know it was a kind of marcus against</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">a kind of left refusal um of of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.039" style="s2">um idea that feminism and capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">were um compatible</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.039" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting looking at that now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t discuss this question</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">of gender at all i basically took it for</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">granted that we knew what we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">talking about when we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">men and women</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">um you know and that what we were</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">talking about was where the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">and economic aspects of how that played</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">out but</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">but the kind of the terms themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">weren&#39;t in contestation</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">so something definitely happened in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">10-year period in which i would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:34.240" style="s2">there are at least kind of two</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">definitions of gender at work you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.240" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">one of which was this kind of second</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">wave</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">definite the idea that gender was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">of imposition and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">and ultimately that was something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">needed to be abolished or eliminated you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">know the the second word position is</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">really that</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">gender was a negative thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">these expectations were bad for both</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">boys and girls and men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">actually what you wanted to do was</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">expand</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">uh you know the expressive possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:01.440" style="s2">of sexuality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:03.039" style="s2">uh and and habits and hobbies and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.440" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">love and all these other things and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.039" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">so people should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">you know do whatever they wanted kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">regardless of sex as it were</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">um but then i think it&#39;s it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">more obvious that there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">uh antagonistic concept of gender which</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:19.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mat doesn&#39;t work with the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">one and it and it&#39;s kind of tried to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.840" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">replace it</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">in lots of ways which is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:28.000" style="s2">perhaps of a gender as an inner feeling</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">you know something that is um</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.000" end="00:06:32.560" style="s2">an identity and i think we didn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">you know my generation didn&#39;t grow up</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.560" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">with that idea of identity and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">touches on</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">this question more broadly not just to</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">do with sex</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">but you know the the idea that one is</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">one&#39;s identity as opposed to what one</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:46.639" style="s2">does or</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">you know that i think we were much more</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">used to this idea of becoming rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">than being</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">something um and i you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">big a big question about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">technology you know what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">kind of live in such a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">a separated way in the mind body sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">split or the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">image feeling of self split online where</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">people are kind of constantly</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a felt need to present</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">oneself</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">as a thing you know as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">circulating identity</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">uh in this kind of playground um which</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">which oddly seems to have kind of become</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">very fixed</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">um you know and and people become very</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:27.680" style="s2">territorial and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">proprietorial about identity um</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.680" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">which you know i&#39;m i&#39;m very against and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t make sense for for</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">someone of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">my generation to think like that um at</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">all and if we had an identity it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">like a kind of shared uselessness you</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">know like everyone was a bit rubbish and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">that was quite good and i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:49.759" style="s2">in the 90s there was a kind of humor was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">much more about like everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.759" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">everything could be mocked</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">and there was like in a nice way you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">know and that everybody was kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">yeah i mean potentially uh could laugh</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">oneself and i think something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">that&#39;s become lost it&#39;s become very</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">people have become very rigid and uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">possessive</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">um about this so i mean to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">your question i just think</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">you know like we there&#39;s i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">not controversial to say that there are</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">at least these two definitions of gender</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:19.919" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">incompatible and that this is partly at</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.919" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">the root of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">in all of these debates about who who</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">can and can&#39;t call themselves a woman or</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">what does this</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">woman mean i mean the contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">definition seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">if you ask who is a woman it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">that uh part of humanity that has large</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:39.839" style="s2">gametes</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">right as opposed to small gametes which</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.839" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">would be the biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">definition it would be anyone who says</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">they are a woman</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">is a woman but of course this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">circular definition</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">right so there&#39;s no content to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">simply a kind of assertion</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">um that fits with a kind of very uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">asatoric definitive notion of language</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.160" style="s2">that language is this kind of possessive</p>

<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">image of beckett and i was very drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">this idea and i</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">i love samuel beckett so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">particularly how it is and the later</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">where the prose becomes kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">completely um</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">uh primordial and you know like you use</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.519" style="s2">this word</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">like sonic a lot like this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.519" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">kind of earthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.839" end="00:14:18.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.160" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">and but that brings me to the tie</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.800" end="00:14:21.760" style="s2">naturally</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.440" end="00:14:23.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve been reading a secret society</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.760" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">um i i&#39;m just in awe of these people all</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">getting together to have these talks and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">nature with one another and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">meet minds that were so similar</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">when there is traditionally so much</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">fighting on the left but to form like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">this higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">you know um mental spiritual connection</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:46.320" style="s2">um with the battalion society and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">curious to hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.320" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">what you think about the battalion</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">um yeah i mean i&#39;m like this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">secret society i think is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">like really really important um</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">interesting and all kinds of levels i</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">mean i think our current situation</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">you know like something like this for</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">example is kind of post academic or para</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">academic or</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">you know uh parallel to in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">formal institutional structure and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">think you know this is the world we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">kind of heading into the course i</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">i ran with justin murphy on but i was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">kind of you know absolutely this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:22.639" style="s2">you know experimental thing we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">former academics who left</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.639" end="00:15:27.199" style="s2">for various reasons you know partly to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">do the desire for freedom partly because</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.199" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">we were</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.279" style="s2">getting kind of in trouble uh for other</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.279" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">and you know i mean to to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">these new things i mean at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously a kind of huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:40.880" style="s2">tension brought up by figures like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">gambin in his you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.880" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">actually very perhaps hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:46.399" style="s2">criticism of zoom</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">you know he&#39;s kind of comparing the use</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.399" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">of zoom to almost kind of like fascist</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">uh um modes of being you know as if as</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">if we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re turning our back on</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing things like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">uh you know what we&#39;re losing is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">proximity</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">is the kind of social interaction you</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">know the the face to face</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">um and i think that that must also be</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">born in mind you know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">whatever happens well you know obviously</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">better that these things happen that</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">but they can&#39;t they&#39;re not the same and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.839" style="s2">they can&#39;t replace</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:21.759" style="s2">let&#39;s say an intimate you know social</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.839" end="00:16:22.959" style="s2">scene and so the question of the secret</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.759" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.959" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">i think whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">online or off you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">clearly i mean what&#39;s what strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.320" style="s2">about what but i and the others</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">and kozovsky and others were up to at</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.320" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">that time is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">trying to push the limits of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:38.480" style="s2">possible within a kind of agreement so</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.480" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">the idea that you have a loyalty and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">bond and whatever happens within the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">society and it&#39;s not even about doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">scandalous things necessarily people get</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">hung up on the human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">idea but i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">aspect of what they were doing i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">what they were trying to do is actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">push a kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">thought a sort of um group mental</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:06.880" style="s2">who&#39;s um esoteric aspects had to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">protected</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.880" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">in order for the esoteric to to then be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">able to thrive i mean because asifa was</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">kind of exoteric you know as in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">outward looking</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">um thing as well with the mag with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:20.319" style="s2">journal</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">you know and i and i do think i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.319" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">raven gave a very nice talk in there but</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:26.079" style="s2">i caused about how for example like</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">marriage could be conceived as a secret</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.079" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:30.160" style="s2">and i really like this idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">because it actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.160" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">repositions something that we might</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">criticize</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:37.440" style="s2">as a traditional structure as something</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">oppressive and you know should be</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">transcended and it reposes it as</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">something potentially much more like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:48.400" style="s2">intriguing and um and secret</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">and i actually really i thought that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.400" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">really uh interesting and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">i kind of agree i do think you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">that need for the uh</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">kind of developing that idea uh using pi</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">and and also thinking about uh issues</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">that i think even your poem brings up</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.200" style="s2">which is like a kind of alienation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">of connection to nature</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.200" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">and you just brought this up in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">sense of like proximity right because</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">all of these ways in which this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">particularly now</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.360" style="s2">we are finding ourselves in intimate</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:18.960" style="s2">relationships with one another are</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.360" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">mediated through</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.960" end="00:19:22.000" style="s2">this uh this technological force which</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.000" end="00:19:26.400" style="s2">inherently a manipulative it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:28.240" style="s2">inherently withdrawn manipulative uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.400" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">entity that we are interacting with and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.240" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">interfacing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">in order to have these most precious</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">uh aspects of the human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.600" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">that&#39;s why i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">um in the sense of like we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost so much already in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">the ground of the human experience that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.840" style="s2">we have to go back to the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">basic form of bonding</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.840" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">and secrecy which is the dyad is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">most basic form i mean you have the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">internal world</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">obviously um which can be your own</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">secret</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">realm but in a sense like at least from</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">the individual is a kind of illusion um</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">that we&#39;ve moved to be primary in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">contemporary sense but really we are of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">of a collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">and the individual is a kind of emergent</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">property of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:20.880" style="s2">so to try and to reform um bonds that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">are long-standing you spoke of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.880" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">these relationships that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:26.960" style="s2">throughout your life that are now</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:28.720" style="s2">like i mean they become more the most</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.960" end="00:20:31.679" style="s2">precious things that you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.720" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">and to kind of reform and re-understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.679" end="00:20:36.880" style="s2">and revitalize the notion of marriage</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">as kind of a revolutionary act where you</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.880" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">sealing off to the outside and you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">protecting a zone</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:46.000" style="s2">where the forces of technology cannot</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">penetrate where the forces</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.000" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">of identity you know kind of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">talking about earlier anita about how</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:53.760" style="s2">identity is this kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">thing out there that you like put on</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.760" end="00:20:58.480" style="s2">yourself and you contort yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">into this like house exterior form um</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.480" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s about presenting yourself to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">world and about like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">like almost curating a kind of celebrity</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">or kind of brand</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">like you push that out outside of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">membrane and in time</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">and in the inside you have this like</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">secret world that&#39;s kind of how i</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">have been thinking about um this notion</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">of marriage</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">yeah no i think that&#39;s really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">and actually i do i do agree that like</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">in the in the age of kind of tinder and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">the algorithm deciding who you should</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">date that actually um to to be loyal and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">and you know i mean to use badger in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:34.400" style="s2">language like to be faithful if you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">have fidelity to an event let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.400" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">love event you know to to be with</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">someone to decide actually to</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.400" style="s2">you know spend your life with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">is does actually now appear</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.400" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">not not so much domestic tyranny but</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">rather a radical and revolutionary act</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">even zizek was making this point you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">know about 10 15 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.480" style="s2">you know rather than the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">absolute and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.480" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">interchangeability of the other in which</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of constantly moving through</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">random others which i think kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">absolutely um</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">you know evacuates everybody of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.000" style="s2">uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.360" style="s2">in a way so i mean just to to answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">like rachel&#39;s question about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.360" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">thinkers i mean it it occurs to me that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">really in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:18.559" style="s2">of a piece with what we&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">it&#39;s really my peers</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.559" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">who i respect more i mean of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">there are kind of older</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">figures who i you know admire who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">still alive you know including a gambin</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">and baju and and others but actually the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">i i would say the most kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">and moving discussions are with people</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">who are i don&#39;t know i mean more or less</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">of similar</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">cohort or younger you know that that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">act of thinking i mean the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">dialogue itself is what&#39;s important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">the older you get it&#39;s less about having</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.280" end="00:22:57.600" style="s2">a particular master</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.640" end="00:22:59.120" style="s2">or a particular figure that one follows</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.600" end="00:23:02.080" style="s2">and reads up but rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.120" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s having the dialogue with particular</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.080" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">you know or it doesn&#39;t have to be two</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">but yeah like we keep coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">dialogue and i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">yeah absolutely the the esoteric aspect</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">you know walking with your friend in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">and discussing spinoza or something i</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">mean you know what&#39;s more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">really than this so yeah i think my</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">my peers would be my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">today i think it&#39;s amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">we&#39;re able to find peer groups like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">they think of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:39.600" style="s2">ccru and the uk and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">the tax society and what people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">doing right now and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">secret societies i mean they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">given a bad name</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:49.200" style="s2">by some people um but what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.200" end="00:23:57.440" style="s2">end goal of a secret society is it a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">way to heretically</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.440" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">communicate to succeed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">create a utopia what what is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just an exploration of those bonds</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.520" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">itself i mean i think the the act of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:13.919" style="s2">mutually agreeing with other people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">preserve a particular space</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.919" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">you know you can think of it as a kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">of yeah a secret society or a cartel or</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">a dyad or a</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.159" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">you know or a dialogic partner you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">in a way it&#39;s it&#39;s both closed and open</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">so i mean i think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">really you know noticed that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">happening again over the past 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">and and you know one of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">things i think that was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">in the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">at least in london and the london art</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">world and so on</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">was um in a sense a kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">abstract or even absent notion of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">friendship or loyalty like those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">weren&#39;t there anymore there was a kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">of dispensability of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">people you know where people had if they</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">transgressed or said or did the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:00.320" style="s2">thing people were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">um you know expelled increasingly in</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.320" end="00:25:04.159" style="s2">this kind of mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">um as kind of scapegoating mechanism and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.159" end="00:25:07.440" style="s2">as if there was some other abstract</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.840" style="s2">world in which</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.440" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">uh you know the left was working towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.840" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">a load of people it wasn&#39;t just everyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:16.480" style="s2">who was there and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">and it just kind of became more obvious</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">to me that no</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">that we are all we have you know there</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:24.480" style="s2">there isn&#39;t some other thing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">dispense with each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:28.400" style="s2">in order to you know uh be more in favor</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.400" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">it&#39;s we have to work with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.840" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">you know to imagine that you can just</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">kind of dispense with people in this way</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">was actually extremely kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:39.440" style="s2">destructive so</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.520" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">i kind of had a revelation about things</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.440" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">like loyalty and friendship</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">in a very real and concrete way and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:47.679" style="s2">about the meaningfulness of those things</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">you know these are not um</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.679" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">minor things these are absolutely kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">of um crucial central things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">actually sustain</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">a life and a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">thoughtful existence um</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:09.520" style="s2">how do you think that um alienation</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">works its way into the history of men</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.520" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">versus the history of women</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:15.360" style="s2">and how that shows up today with this</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">kind of atomization process</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.360" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">of kind of living in a techno-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">question i mean i&#39;ve been working a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">in the last two years on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">um discretion of of men rather than</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.559" style="s2">right so i&#39;ve written this book called</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">what do men want which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.559" end="00:26:36.320" style="s2">jokey reference to</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">freud&#39;s question what does woman want</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.320" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">and so i reposed it</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">to about men and and obviously there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">been a lot of discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">you know a very negative discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">about men in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:49.279" style="s2">you know these ideas of toxic</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.799" style="s2">masculinity and this idea that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.279" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">men are somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.799" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know fatally like awful</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.440" style="s2">thing um which has been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">promulgated by very liberal media</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.440" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">um you know at the same time it also a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.919" style="s2">kind of fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">of of of a resurgence or a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">particular kind of masculinity which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">then associated with the dissident right</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">alt-right or in cells or so on so i kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">of looked at all these sort of phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:16.159" style="s2">and the way in which they kind of play</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.159" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">in the discourse and it actually ended</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:22.159" style="s2">up being a book about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.080" style="s2">between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.159" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s actually really in the end a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.080" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">book about how men and women get along</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">and the kind of games and interactions</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">that they have in a very mixed</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.159" style="s2">world because after all our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:35.279" style="s2">contemporary world is a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.159" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">heterosocial</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">one right which is to say not a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">heterosexual one although sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">is that as well but</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">primarily it&#39;s a world in which men and</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">women work together</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">they see each other on the street it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">not a segregated world it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">intricate world which has caused kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">a lot of problems</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">and fears and anxieties perhaps because</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">there is so much proximity</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">um and you know particularly after</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">things like me too it&#39;s obvious that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">is a great deal of anxiety around things</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">like sexual approaches</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">and you know lots of people used to meet</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">their partner</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">or their future wife or husband at work</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">now you know many people would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">um anxious about um you know any form of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">flirtation or romantic interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:24.080" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">in a work environment so there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.080" end="00:28:29.279" style="s2">of you know a suspicion and</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">a hostility that&#39;s kind of been um</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.279" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">really uh exacerbated in the past few</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">um and i tried to think about what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">might mean to actually kind of reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">in a kind of fun and playful way</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">um so in terms of alienation i suppose</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in like yeah i guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">actually probably like a collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">project that would involve both men and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:53.919" style="s2">you know just in trying to work out</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s going on and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.919" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">be together</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.399" style="s2">and how we can live together in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:28:59.279" style="s2">kind of complicated way i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.399" end="00:29:02.240" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.279" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">in it&#39;s very complicated because i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.240" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">obviously i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">men and women are different right you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">know i do think there are important</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">differences</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">but at the same time i think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">collective social and intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">emotional and romantic and even</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.640" style="s2">friendship project</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:20.240" style="s2">that is possible you know and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.640" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">indeed happens you know men and women</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.240" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">are friends</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.480" style="s2">you know despite the ideas of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.480" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">and so i do think there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">shared um</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">a shared project which is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">and strange and interesting in that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">can work out together</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in marriage or friendship</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">or you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:42.000" style="s2">collectively socially and in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:43.600" style="s2">think we kind of have to do that i think</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:47.200" style="s2">the idea that we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.600" end="00:29:47.919" style="s2">opposed you know is um and that men are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.200" end="00:29:50.159" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.919" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">you know irredeemably flawed is</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.159" end="00:29:53.760" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">untrue and extremely unhelpful i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.760" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">think that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">experience that most women have of most</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">right it&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:04.720" style="s2">some terrible things that happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">right and we&#39;re all capable of terrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.720" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">things we&#39;re all we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">done harm we&#39;ve all hurt people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">all upset people we&#39;ve all behaved</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:13.360" style="s2">badly we&#39;ve all said things that have</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:15.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.360" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">you know caused real damage and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.760" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">older you get i think the more you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">learn to live with that and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">understand that and i think</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:25.919" style="s2">we live in a a very weird post-christian</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">period in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.919" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">socially which is to say we have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">kind of almost like an old testament</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">you know desire to punish each other but</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">without the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:39.520" style="s2">forgiveness you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">so people are very very kind of um quick</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.520" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">say well this person did or said that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:46.960" style="s2">but they&#39;re much much less</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:48.559" style="s2">uh amenable to forgiveness and and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.960" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">think we can&#39;t really proceed without</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.559" end="00:30:50.960" style="s2">forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s not to say that we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.960" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">recognize harm where it&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">occurred</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">but i think you know we have often this</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">kind of very cold vigilante</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">understanding and you know obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">internet has become a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">brutal tool in the punishment and use</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">circulation of names if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.159" style="s2">accuse someone of something you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely blunt you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.159" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">where your</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">your accusation is going to end up when</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">it often does a lot of damage</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:18.080" style="s2">to people so i tried to look at all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">these kinds of um</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.080" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">things and and suggest a more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">yeah like uh reconciled and playful and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">and intellectual and thoughtful way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">being together</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:32.960" style="s2">that does address alienation you know of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.960" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">i suppose i didn&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">yeah it really does um</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">so we&#39;re kind of at the halfway point so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.399" end="00:31:46.720" style="s2">if people want to throw chat</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">uh questions in and we will uh look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.720" end="00:31:49.760" style="s2">your questions and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:51.360" style="s2">you can meet yourself and ask your</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.760" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">question directly to nita or</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.360" end="00:31:56.480" style="s2">me or rachel um but i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna want to keep kind of riffing</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.480" end="00:32:00.799" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">um what you just presented here which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.799" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:06.080" style="s2">i think there seems to be a struggle</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">with pluralism</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">we seem to be struggling with the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:12.320" style="s2">that there are different kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">who need different kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.320" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">and that maybe there would be pockets of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">who would be appealing to certain people</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">based on their certain kind of desire</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">for those certain kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:26.840" style="s2">and there&#39;s a desire like it seems for</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">certain factions to devour</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.840" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">preferences of other factions and this</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">the case with maybe something like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">idea of like polyamory versus</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">monogamy right like there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">war about like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">you know which mating strategy is better</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">or dating strategy is better and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.200" end="00:32:47.200" style="s2">what about the possibility that for some</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">people polyamory works and for some</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.200" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">people monogamy works and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">would be philosophical intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">romantic</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.360" style="s2">like cultures and movements that appeal</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">to those two</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.360" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">microcosms of of existence and that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">one needing to devour the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">is is like kind of a moot point so what</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:08.720" style="s2">do you what do you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.600" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">this like lack of of pluralism that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.720" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">have in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">um yeah i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">in practice things are very pluralist i</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">think people</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">do live in very different life worlds</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">and you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">you know i i agree about polygamy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">do i mean polygamy polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">polygamy that&#39;s not generally engaged in</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">ask yourself whatever you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.680" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">about or reading or talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">about you know to ask yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">first place well what do i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">you know before you then start to think</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">oh well what does this person think or</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:02.400" style="s2">what should i think or what&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">thing to think or what are most people</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.400" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">you know i mean it&#39;s so basic but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">it seemed to take me a really long time</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">to learn this in certain ways and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">there&#39;s also a kind of often like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">female socialization</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">thing which is about being nice and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:17.520" style="s2">know it&#39;s quite hard to resist that sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">of training</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.520" end="00:36:21.119" style="s2">um you know where you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">upset people</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.119" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">and actually sometimes saying what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">think is going to cause um</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">upset um and then asking that question</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">of whether</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.800" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s worth saying what you think because</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to cause trouble or</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.160" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">or keeping quiet becomes like quite um</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">a major one so i don&#39;t know i mean again</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">i think this is just</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">a sort of existential lesson that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">perhaps i learned as well and and also</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">kind of recovering from</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">being a you know quite hardcore</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">alcoholic and then just waking up</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">and going like oh my god what have i</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">been doing for 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">and suddenly realizing in a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">that even though i&#39;d been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:05.200" style="s2">thinking and working and doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:07.599" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.200" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">and you know whether it was you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.599" end="00:37:12.240" style="s2">writing essays or</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">activism or whatever teaching that in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.240" end="00:37:16.400" style="s2">way some sort of basic</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">things i hadn&#39;t quite articulated or</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.400" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">grounded for myself which would be to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">with this freedom</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">to think independently first of all</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">and i think because also the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">leftist project</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">in a way it depends upon a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">putting</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">an abstract notion of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.320" style="s2">first as if</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">you know the individual is not really</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.320" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">relevant you know or that your</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">feelings or thoughts are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">secondary um</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:46.320" style="s2">to whatever the the group think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s very common for</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">almost any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">dominant group in a way um</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">so to like reclaim your own mind first</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">of all seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">major step</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:02.640" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve been feeling that way like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">very strongly because</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.640" end="00:38:07.440" style="s2">you know i think that there&#39;s so many uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:09.359" style="s2">maybe if we&#39;re being generous like kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.440" end="00:38:12.079" style="s2">of archetypes or um</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.359" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">concepts of what it means to actualize</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.079" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">that are being sold to you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">essentially um kind of competing for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">your attention and so as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s yours</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">and what&#39;s someone else&#39;s and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">kind of necessity</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">to take on the question of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">i think you spoke with that earlier with</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">the kind of second wave feminist kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">becoming oneself kind of arising into</p>

<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">throughout the entirety of your life</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:44.720" style="s2">cycle you know because that continuously</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">transforms over the course of someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.720" end="00:38:48.880" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">and that continual becoming</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.880" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">uh and that introspective process i</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">think is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">crucial for i mean i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">political act i literally</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">like i really think it&#39;s a revolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">political act</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:03.599" style="s2">to engage from oneself and to ask</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.599" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">way and i think maybe that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">question because there&#39;s so much</p>

<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">in a lot of like new age thinking like</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">weird health guru thing so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">like turn into ourselves and really ask</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">these difficult questions about who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">we becoming without falling into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">trap</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">of solipsism and narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">no sure i mean in a way i think this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">capacity to think or like</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">you know sort of re-reasserting</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">that basic empty category of thought is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">in a way it doesn&#39;t have necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">having even any content it&#39;s simply a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">potential it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">i couldn&#39;t think it&#39;s like i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">is why philosophy is always</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">going back to absolutely fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">things or foundational questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">constantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">and in a way philosophy seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">nothing other on some level</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">than the reposing endlessly of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">incredibly simple</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">you know forms of openness and wonder to</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">the very act of thinking itself and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">and that kind of always has to be born</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">in mind so so i would say even before</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.400" style="s2">this kind of content</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.839" style="s2">of like the self or particular things</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.400" end="00:40:12.319" style="s2">that one is thinking</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.839" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s to do with that kind of um capacity</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.319" end="00:40:16.000" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">um and that&#39;s what that kind of needs to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.000" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">preserved or protected and so i mean i i</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know in a weird way i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">like one is not even herself or</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">not even an individual at that level you</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like the cartesian thing of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s like okay i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.960" style="s2">therefore i am but it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">i mean descartes even says too much i</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.960" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">what he should say is there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:42.000" style="s2">thinking you know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">thought happening and it&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.000" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">so you know i i mean i know what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">mean and i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:50.960" style="s2">a lot of political resistance to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:52.640" style="s2">idea of individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.960" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">thinking you know that actually needs to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.640" end="00:40:57.119" style="s2">also be overcome i mean i also</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">um you know did psychoanalysis for three</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:01.119" style="s2">years and and actually like</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">you know i&#39;m still in analysis and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.119" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">getting over that guilt of even talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">oneself as if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:09.760" style="s2">interesting to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">about it and and actually there both is</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.760" end="00:41:12.880" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like well you&#39;re no more or</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">less interesting than anyone or anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">right um and in a way it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">you it&#39;s like whatever that means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">you know there is a a process there is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">there is a way in which you sort of came</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">to be who you are or in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually something kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.240" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">very interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">understanding that and actually that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">opens you up to the world</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">again you know that it that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">necessarily or hopefully become a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">narcissistic or solipsistic project but</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:49.280" style="s2">actually what it does is kind of break</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">you away from those things precisely so</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.280" end="00:41:52.400" style="s2">that you can be more</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:55.119" style="s2">in the world and more with other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.400" end="00:41:57.040" style="s2">and more thoughtful and more expansive</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.119" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">so i think both philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.040" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">psychoanalysis if we want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:04.960" style="s2">have that as a kind of breaking open</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">into the world you know that it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.960" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">confirmation there&#39;s nothing positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">necessarily about it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">psychoanalysis is famously not there to</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.440" style="s2">make you feel better</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t teach you how to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.440" end="00:42:20.000" style="s2">happy or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.760" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">nor does philosophy exactly</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.000" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">oh great be happy maybe</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">you need to be more interesting speaking</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.200" end="00:42:30.400" style="s2">of interesting i&#39;ve been looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:32.319" style="s2">some very interesting questions and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.400" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">comments in this chat</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.319" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">um hello kante would you like to unmute</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve worked with budo uh nina and uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">yuva i&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve probably read</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">loads of uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">jack and hegel but the question is um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">would you say almost uh because you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:57.200" style="s2">in the battalion i was never really in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.200" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">in the course for that but uh one</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">example of a feminine</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.000" style="s2">femininity that is always referred to as</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">the antigone myth</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.000" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">and that kind of conspiracy between</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">antigone and ismane</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">and i was just wondering like what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:12.480" style="s2">thought about like almost like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">the modern</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.480" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">version of that or how how would that be</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:17.599" style="s2">interpreted in today&#39;s light especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:19.920" style="s2">given the fact that i know</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.599" end="00:43:21.359" style="s2">one of one of our things raven talks was</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.920" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">the importance of motherhood</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.359" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">whereas in taken he&#39;s traditionally seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">as a figure who&#39;s kind of against the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">idea of motherhood and that&#39;s what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">almost be against by committing the act</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">when she does</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:36.000" style="s2">um yeah no sure i mean there&#39;s loads of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.240" style="s2">things to say about antigone and her</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.000" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">relation to the state and to justice</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.240" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">and so on i mean like i mean before his</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.640" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">death recently bernard stiegler was</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.560" end="00:43:46.079" style="s2">talking about greta thunder as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2">antigone</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.079" end="00:43:49.599" style="s2">figure right so i mean it&#39;s quite it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">kind of quite strange i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.599" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">what whatever we think about about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">idea but but</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">you know the idea of kind of um the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">the female figure opposing if you like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:37.280" style="s2">at the risk and cost of her own</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.359" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">extinction</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.280" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">because that&#39;s what she&#39;s committed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">so it&#39;s a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">you know she&#39;s a kind of heroic figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:46.160" style="s2">obviously in this way</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">you know and she poses the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.160" end="00:44:49.599" style="s2">of a kind of thought and being outside</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.599" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">what the laws are what we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">do um</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">no and in that sense she&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">a perennial figure of thought</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">and being you know that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">you know exists as a possibility for for</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">in a way or not for anyone but i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">potentially for anyone like can anyone</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">be antigone</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">perhaps you know it&#39;s like a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:18.720" style="s2">um in particular circumstances perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:19.760" style="s2">so i mean what i mean one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.720" end="00:45:22.800" style="s2">suppose that</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">maybe is quite lacking today in many</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.800" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">ways is the kind of idea of tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">you know we live in a world that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">of obviously very</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">technocratic technological progressive</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">in lots of ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:38.000" style="s2">very positivistic very scientific</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">you know that that even in the face of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.000" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">kind of global pandemic and what could</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:44.800" style="s2">be an opportunity to rethink</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">um values and death in particular i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.800" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">this is kind of again what gambin was</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:52.480" style="s2">was saying that that actually it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">still remains at the level often of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.480" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">very uh you know statistical</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">political technocratic discourse right</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">necessarily been a rethinking or</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:07.280" style="s2">opening up of these deeper questions</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:09.760" style="s2">about the value of life and death</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">you know and the reality of of death you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.760" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">when we talk about extinction and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">possibility environmentally or</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">globally in relation to some you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">like the pandemic of course it raises</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">this question of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">human extinction um</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:29.200" style="s2">you know are we able as a society to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.200" end="00:46:33.520" style="s2">about about tragedy and about fate in</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:35.920" style="s2">the same way that the greeks</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.520" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">might might have done i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.920" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">you know tragedy seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">disappeared in into</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">you know it seems to have dissolved</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">right into this kind of technocratic</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">image of death in which death is simply</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">hygienic possibility for being you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of hidden away</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">um so i mean figures like antigone</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:59.280" style="s2">point to a different relation to death</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">right i mean of course they do</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.280" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">you know to to want to to and again</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">again they talked about burial rights</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.000" style="s2">he was very very opposed to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">that people would no longer be able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.000" end="00:47:12.319" style="s2">bury</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">they&#39;re dead and to be there in ritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.319" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">ways you know in ceremonial ways</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">yes no sacrifice yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">ritual and also the the banning</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:32.160" style="s2">of those that came before you not you</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:35.520" style="s2">but like the general act</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.160" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">of people starting something</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.520" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">together that they&#39;re really passionate</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:40.319" style="s2">about and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">many people come in don&#39;t really get it</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.319" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re just really good at mimicry</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:47.680" style="s2">and they work their way up you know um</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">and academia</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.680" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">did you ever feel like these people</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">were against you or did you just find a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:56.079" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">to get along with them did you play the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">game like how do you operate</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">in that frame um yeah but i mean i was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">lecturer for 13 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">i mean i think things shifted once the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">because obviously we had the fee regime</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">in britain that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">you know so the fee we lost the battle</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.119" end="00:48:14.400" style="s2">to stop their fees becoming very high so</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">they were 9</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.400" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">000 pounds a year so students were</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">ending up with in 50 000 pounds worth of</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">debt</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">you know more like the american model</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:27.359" style="s2">you know i i i think it became i mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">you know where i was teaching was not an</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.359" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">elite institution so my students were</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">often coming from working-class</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">backgrounds and they were often</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">working while they were studying and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:39.440" style="s2">cost</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:41.440" style="s2">in every sense of doing a degree was was</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.440" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">very high and the anxiety that it would</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.440" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">it was inducing was very very high and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">and i felt that it became harder and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:49.359" style="s2">harder and less moral</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:52.240" style="s2">to be a teacher in that environment you</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.359" end="00:48:55.599" style="s2">know to actually support this system</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.240" end="00:48:58.720" style="s2">of mass debt um you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.599" end="00:49:00.960" style="s2">you know the mass induction of debt uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.720" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">in us in a system in which people were</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.960" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">not going to get jobs that were</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">worthy of their intellect in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">following the degree um</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i mean i was never</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:15.520" style="s2">really i mean i&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">yeah i was a good academic in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.520" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">and a really bad academic in other ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">most academics are personally very</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">socially conservative</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">even if they work on like you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:28.839" style="s2">revolutionary stuff or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">they&#39;re actually very um you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.839" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">uh careful um about how they behave</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">because a lot of people don&#39;t obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to lose their job</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">um so they they you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">academia became very inhibited and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:42.160" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">that more and more like i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.160" end="00:49:46.720" style="s2">a lot of fear in academia of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:48.240" style="s2">speaking about particular issues and a</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.720" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">lot of academics just keep their head</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.240" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.040" style="s2">which isn&#39;t very good for a productive</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">intellectual environment right like</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.040" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">you what you want is people who are free</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">to to think and to speak and to do work</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">that might actually you know tell you</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:02.720" style="s2">things that people don&#39;t want to know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.720" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">to push the boat out to to actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:09.200" style="s2">yeah say dangerous and difficult things</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:10.839" style="s2">not just for the sake of it but because</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">they might be true</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.839" end="00:50:14.559" style="s2">um you know and i think that that became</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">harder and harder</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.559" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">for everybody um and i do think</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">contemporary academia</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">is over i i think those institutions</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">many of them are going to fall they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:25.040" style="s2">going to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">as a result of kobe but they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.040" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">already kind of over</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">um in many many ways ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">because they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">screwed um you know because of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">of fear and the dominance of particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:38.880" style="s2">ways of speaking and i don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">was kind of everywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.880" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">it was it was getting bad definitely</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">um and students themselves were becoming</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">afraid to speak in seminars you know i</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">really noticed this as the years went on</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">they they were afraid in case they said</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">the wrong thing and that they would get</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.000" style="s2">punished by their peers</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.680" style="s2">and a lot of students were on you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.000" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">quite a lot of antidepressants they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.680" end="00:51:00.480" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.359" style="s2">you know in very bad mental states</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.480" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.359" end="00:51:04.880" style="s2">um and it was really quite sad and awful</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:06.880" style="s2">to see that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.880" end="00:51:08.319" style="s2">and there was very little really you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.880" end="00:51:10.880" style="s2">do as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.319" end="00:51:12.079" style="s2">random lecturer about that so there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.880" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">a kind of general</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.079" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">negative climate um i would say and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">the question then becomes what comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">after and i think after a plague</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">there&#39;s usually like a renaissance you</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">know cultural renaissance so i think a</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">lot of the old institutions whether</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">they&#39;re academic or artistic</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">or whatever all of these big things a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">lot of them are going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">radically change or they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">fall</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">apart and people are going to start</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.839" style="s2">doing much more of their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.680" style="s2">um and i actually think and i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.839" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">maybe justin makes this argument</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.680" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">that the elites are actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">abandon a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">elite institutions and set up their own</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">as well you know that actually they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.599" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">just hand them over</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">um two people who give chair random</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:57.680" style="s2">meaningless chairs and positions</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">to people in order to appear gracious</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.680" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">and woke but actually they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:05.760" style="s2">carry on doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:09.200" style="s2">elsewhere so</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:10.319" style="s2">yeah we have a good question from dan we</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.200" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">actually have a few</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.319" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">questions from dan feldman in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">dan do you want to mute yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">ask your questions um sure</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">but uh can you copy one of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:24.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">i haven&#39;t been following raven i have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.160" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">question which one did you like best</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">um i think that this one where would you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">expect this discourse to open up to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">more metaphysical approach</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:36.079" style="s2">is interesting and then also the one</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.720" end="00:52:38.160" style="s2">before which was oh</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.079" end="00:52:39.119" style="s2">jealousy is related to fear there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.160" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.119" end="00:52:43.119" style="s2">practices that can dissolve fear but</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">this is a side discussion in some way to</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.119" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">the discussions of polyamory i think the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:48.880" style="s2">more interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.079" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">is this what needs are people attempting</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.880" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">to meet by participating in polyamory</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">versus pairing versus aestheticism</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">what are the biggest underserved needs</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">in this meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:00.800" style="s2">i&#39;m going to roof on that and then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s i think you did just</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.800" end="00:53:07.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll just go you you did well thank you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">um nina i&#39;ll i&#39;ll repost the question if</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.440" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">you want to look</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">you know i can see them i can see them</p>

<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">they&#39;re two slightly different ones i</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know dan</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">would you want to sort of focus on</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">on one um</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.400" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">i mean i guess to riffing off of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">comments</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">that that we&#39;ve lost the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">tragedy in society i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:40.839" style="s2">it&#39;s to me it&#39;s an aesthetically</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">um blind ignorant dumb</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:46.000" style="s2">society where 80</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">of what it means to be human is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.000" end="00:53:50.240" style="s2">reflected in</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:52.400" style="s2">in the minds and the souls of the people</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.240" end="00:53:56.319" style="s2">running the society</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.400" end="00:53:59.760" style="s2">um and i would argue that that&#39;s a lack</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.319" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">a lack of you know considering</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.760" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">philosophical or metaphysical issues to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to tie this together into a</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.720" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:17.520" style="s2">well okay here here&#39;s the question uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning that the academia and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.520" end="00:54:20.640" style="s2">the universities are sort of collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:21.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s going to be probably some</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.640" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:25.920" style="s2">a flight from them into what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">starting to see and i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.920" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to see this</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">is some kind of embedded uh learning</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:34.880" style="s2">ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">where learning institutions perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.880" end="00:54:39.119" style="s2">completely unrelated to the historical</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">learning institutions will start</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.119" end="00:54:42.640" style="s2">seed forms will start appearing and they</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.640" end="00:54:45.680" style="s2">embedded tightly into the community and</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.359" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.680" end="00:54:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a more organic form a more</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">organic complex uh emergent form</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">of learning and education</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">that is focused i&#39;m hoping on</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:06.720" style="s2">actually solving the problems that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">old system created</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.720" end="00:55:10.559" style="s2">and i&#39;m wondering if you have any any</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">thoughts or ideas of whether</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing anything in that yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:16.319" style="s2">mean i i think you know i think people</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">want to learn and talk to each other i</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.319" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">mean you know like on on some level we</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">have access</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">you know if you have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:22.880" style="s2">internet to the entire history of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">existing</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.880" end="00:55:26.720" style="s2">texts right i mean that you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:27.119" style="s2">possible to get hold of everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.720" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.119" end="00:55:30.960" style="s2">more or less that&#39;s been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:33.920" style="s2">preserved of human</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.960" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">production right so on some level like</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.920" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:40.640" style="s2">immense richness of things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:42.079" style="s2">revisited read together discussed and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.640" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">on and i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">yeah i mean i think people have always</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">spontaneously organized or</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">taught themselves and you know thought</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.599" style="s2">together in</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">you know auto didactic ways or kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.599" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">working-class</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">ways or you know that so i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">not going to stop i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">obviously the technology does allow for</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">kind of multiple platform use in</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:05.520" style="s2">different ways and</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">you know i mean it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.520" end="00:56:09.280" style="s2">to be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.559" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">how much people can meet in person you</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">know i mean i think we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">heading into another lock down here</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:15.520" style="s2">as well i mean not not clear exactly yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">but i</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.520" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s you know those sorts of things are</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">maybe you know clearly becoming much</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">more pressurized and people have lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">you know completely different attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">to whether they are want to be outside</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">with other people or not like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:31.920" style="s2">really huge psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:34.079" style="s2">difference in how people react anxiously</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.920" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">or otherwise to these um</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.079" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">rules or laws it&#39;s not even clear what</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">um and so yeah i mean i think i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">there will be all of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">as you say like learning ecosystems um</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:48.559" style="s2">that are more community based i think i</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">think you&#39;re yeah you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.559" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">more like</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:52.319" style="s2">patchworks of different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">intellectual desires i mean you already</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.319" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">like in forums and and so on you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:58.480" style="s2">people are kind of drawn</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:59.359" style="s2">all over the place right so those ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.480" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.359" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">what interests people i mean i think i</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">mean the kind of more boring</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">institutional question would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">like what happens to accreditation right</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">because obviously people can run around</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">learning whatever they like</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s great and often</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">people are highly motivated to do that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.319" style="s2">much more so than if they think they</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">have to get a degree in order to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">but you know when if institutions kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">of collapse and then you just</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:25.280" style="s2">end up with lots more para academic or</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:26.880" style="s2">kind of semi-academic things</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.280" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">then the question about accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.880" end="00:57:30.000" style="s2">then becomes an issue like what is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:32.559" style="s2">degree worth is it worth</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.000" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">anything you know does it matter if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.559" end="00:57:35.599" style="s2">have one or not i mean</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">what are there even any jobs is there a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.599" end="00:57:39.760" style="s2">kind of economy that</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:40.400" style="s2">in which that would make sense anymore</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.760" end="00:57:43.119" style="s2">um and i</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.400" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">think those are like perhaps massive and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.119" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">really difficult to answer questions at</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:47.680" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">um but i think in the meantime the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.680" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">desire to know and to learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">will absolutely um you know persist and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">i i think people will</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">yeah more and more realize that they are</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">capable you know that it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:01.359" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">these things i mean people were mocking</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.359" end="00:58:06.880" style="s2">people for starting podcasts during the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">um the lockdown but actually i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.880" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">like why not i mean why not people have</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">podcasts to discuss whatever they want</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">and if people are interested in the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">things they can listen to that podcast</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">every podcast will have like one or two</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:20.559" style="s2">listeners</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:22.240" style="s2">but but why not this is like this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.559" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">already very beautiful like</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.240" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">not everything has to appeal to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">largest number of people all the time</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s never going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">you know people make their own kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">worlds and communities and</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">secret societies you know so</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">definitely and the stella is kind of one</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:44.559" style="s2">yeah exactly it&#39;s a really you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">impressively organized one i mean given</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.559" end="00:58:46.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">the range of speakers you have is</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.559" end="00:58:51.280" style="s2">incredible</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">yeah i always spoken back home yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.280" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">you&#39;re one of us</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:59.119" style="s2">i actually wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">uh about embodiment i know it&#39;s very big</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.119" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">in these communities to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:04.640" style="s2">environment but i also know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">as someone who&#39;s also studied market</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.640" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">fisher and nick lands that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:12.799" style="s2">there is not a disembodied philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:14.319" style="s2">that is directly engaging with the mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.799" end="00:59:17.839" style="s2">and not the body</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">and i&#39;m curious if you will get crap</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.839" end="00:59:21.599" style="s2">from other women</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">for like having philosophers you like</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.599" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">embodied enough and just this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">like male female energy</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">dynamic does this kind of thing go on</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">with your</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">peers and how how does that work</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:35.520" style="s2">um i i don&#39;t know i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.799" style="s2">think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.520" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">too much of that kind of um criticism</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.799" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">going on i mean i i i don&#39;t know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:45.680" style="s2">i suppose just just personally it was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">kind of revelation to like</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.680" end="00:59:51.280" style="s2">get fit and work out and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">realize like how much mentally better i</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.280" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:56.000" style="s2">and that this was actually very positive</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.640" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">for my</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.000" end="00:59:59.200" style="s2">you know philosophical thinking as well</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:00.079" style="s2">you know and it&#39;s actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.200" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.079" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">to reflect on that kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">between mind and body in that way</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">um just on some very basic personal</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">level i suppose and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:12.079" style="s2">you know to revisit someone like spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:14.079" style="s2">for example you know who says like</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.079" end="01:00:15.520" style="s2">thought and extension and basically two</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.079" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">different ways of looking at the same</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.520" end="01:00:18.799" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:20.160" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a kind of parallelism</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.799" end="01:00:22.160" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a very different</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.160" end="01:00:23.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not kind of mind-body split that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.160" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">then needs to be put back together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.920" end="01:00:25.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:27.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a slightly different way</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.520" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">of understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.760" end="01:00:31.119" style="s2">the two you know as as one in a certain</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">way you know that they&#39;re kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.119" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">same thing just seen</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">under different attributes and yes i</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">said i know i mean i think yeah i wonder</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s going on with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">embodiment discussion</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:46.400" style="s2">at the moment i mean certainly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:48.640" style="s2">kind of lots of questions about how</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.400" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">disembodied people are like the virtual</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.640" end="01:00:52.400" style="s2">the you know the online you know i mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">when i was doing the research about</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.400" end="01:00:55.440" style="s2">masculinity and men obviously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:00:58.160" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.440" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">question of like men working out came up</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.160" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">a lot you know like the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">uh big celebration of kind of uh gym</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">you know going to the gym and working</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:09.920" style="s2">out and and that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">um you know came up a lot and it was</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.920" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">actually very very interesting and i</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">kind of defend that in the book</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">um as it were you know to say well why</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:22.160" style="s2">why how is it not a positive thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.760" end="01:01:23.520" style="s2">that people that men look after their</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.160" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">bodies rather than</p>

<p begin="01:02:22.319" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">in your in your sphere things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:30.319" style="s2">you&#39;re doing conversations you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">um yeah i don&#39;t know i mean i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.319" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">starting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">to think i&#39;m doing this course on the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">philosophy of risk which is the</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">next kind of big topic i&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.319" style="s2">thinking about um</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.079" end="01:02:41.839" style="s2">and that was in relation partly to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">pandemic it was partly this question as</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.839" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">i was saying about different people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:48.079" style="s2">psychological attitudes you know like</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">actually how do human beings calculate</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.079" end="01:02:52.160" style="s2">their own relation to risk and</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">probability so i wanted to actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.160" end="01:02:54.160" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">you know i&#39;m teaching this course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.160" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">an adult ed course in the uk</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">um about these kind of questions right</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">so because it struck me as very</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">interesting that you had in some</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">situations you could see people</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">being very authoritative or even</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">authoritarian about the rules</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">but sometimes they would break the rules</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:14.640" style="s2">and and actively break the rules like</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">to go on a black lives matter protest</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.640" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">because they valued that more</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">right so you had this kind of often like</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:23.039" style="s2">really massive sea change in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">perspective and evaluation of their own</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.039" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">relation to risk or the collective risk</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.680" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">so i wanted to then just go through like</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">those concepts</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:32.480" style="s2">in this course so yeah that&#39;s one big</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:34.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.480" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">i&#39;m working on and yeah the finishing</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.480" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">the man book basically just doing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.760" style="s2">final edits and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">probably writing more controversial</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.760" end="01:03:42.160" style="s2">articles</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">than a telegraph because i needed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.160" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">make some money uh defending</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">jk rowling and the right to write</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.599" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">fiction about whatever</p>

<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:03:58.640" style="s2">and nasty messages</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.160" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s fine you know people can do</p>
