<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">maybe take a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">time to just give a give a run through</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">your learnings in those 40 years and how</p>

<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">and how slowly people are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">importance more and more too slowly but</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">um you must have lived</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">this waking up in your own life</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">i think people are waking up and and</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">that she is in a way a symptom of a much</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">broader</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">set of dynamics in in our world and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">think at some levels it&#39;s immensely</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">exciting and we may get onto covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">and so on the implications of that but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">i mean to your question 40 years 45</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">years professionally but before that</p>

<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:06.800" style="s2">lived in places like northern ireland</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">and cyprus and israel and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.800" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">um something happened to me when i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:13.599" style="s2">very very young when i was about six or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">seven and i was exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.599" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">in the dark on my own ten tens of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">baby eels or elves it was one of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">magical moments where you just suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">felt absolutely because i was completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">on on my own in the countryside you felt</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">uh panicked at one level and incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">uh at another because i already at six</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">or seven i</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">knew about the sargasso sea element of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">eel&#39;s um life cycle and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.720" style="s2">and out of that came you know when i was</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:47.519" style="s2">at school when i was 11</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.720" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">i stood up and that was 1961 and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.519" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">world wildlife fund</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">was just being launched um and i i stood</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">up in front of 80</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">fellow students and i was paralytically</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.760" style="s2">shy i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">do this sort of thing at all and and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.760" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">i asked them for their</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">weekly allowance for two weeks and got</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">it from everyone and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">sent that off to the uh one life fund um</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">and then you mentioned kindly</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">environmental data services and that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:19.840" style="s2">later that was in 1978 as you said</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:22.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting that i&#39;ve founded</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.840" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">ends in environmental data services</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.000" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">with um two people one of whom was max</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:30.800" style="s2">nicholson who was one of the co-founders</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">of wwf all those years back and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.800" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">and i i discovered you know you you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">suddenly find these things about</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">your own life history and and max and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">were traveling down to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">wwf by car in about 1979</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.320" style="s2">and he asked me the question how did you</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">get involved in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.320" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">and i said well all i remember was being</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">at school going into the school library</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">uh reading something reading a newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">i&#39;m just feeling i had to do something</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">and he said and he said he knew exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">what that was because they got</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">i think 10 pages front cover and 10</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:07.600" style="s2">pages into one of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">major national more popular but national</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.600" end="00:05:09.840" style="s2">newspapers</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:13.199" style="s2">and as soon as he said that i could</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.840" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">remember seeing that coverage in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.199" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">paper and subsequently i found the um</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:20.560" style="s2">the electronic files</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.759" style="s2">uh of all of that but just to conclude</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.560" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">the the first</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.759" end="00:05:26.160" style="s2">um organization that i co-founded was</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">environmental data services</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.160" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">and that wasn&#39;t simply to dig back into</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">the world of the natural</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">environment and so on it was actually to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">dig into the world of business for</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.199" style="s2">for exactly the reasons you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">described which is that at that time you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.199" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">know most of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">were in friends of the earth or</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">greenpeace or whatever and they they</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t like business</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">to put it mildly i mean they just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">trust uh corporate people and and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">know this is after the 60s and and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">all of that sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">insurrection in a way</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:57.360" style="s2">but i felt business was crucial i felt</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">that unless and until we got business</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.360" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">people thinking in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:02.639" style="s2">uh a lot of the stuff that we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">see in the world wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.639" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">happen that&#39;s been a pretty hard slog as</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">you said but i actually think we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:10.639" style="s2">a great deal of progress</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">since how have you seen it changing then</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.639" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">because when you founded sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">that was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:19.919" style="s2">um shortly before you wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">cannibals were forks and and introduced</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.919" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">a triple bottom line into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">business thinking so so i mean you</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">personally have certainly</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">started a rethink in at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">like initially the british kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">focused business businesses or based</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">businesses but then</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">globally um how</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">how did you because i i sensed that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">germany there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">in the 80s and early 90s there was this</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:48.160" style="s2">leadership</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">in in the right direction and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.160" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">suddenly in the mid 90s there</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">was this global globalization</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">boom where everybody just felt they had</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">to either rush along with it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">or they would get left behind and and i</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">know that for example in germany a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">companies that were proudly producing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">the region</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">with regional capacities</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">maybe exporting key elements globally of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">course but</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.599" style="s2">but paying a lot of attention that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">were supporting a community</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.599" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">and where they were based was suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">starting to globalize as well and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">and exporting manufacturing to other</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.800" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">um how did you see that change from</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.800" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">kind of a hopeful start in the late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">early 90s to then that backlash</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:39.280" style="s2">of of greed</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:44.879" style="s2">i think as long as human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">involved you&#39;ve always got the greed</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.879" end="00:07:49.199" style="s2">uh factor and in fact when i went to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">university first time around to study</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.199" end="00:07:53.599" style="s2">economics and when i gave up economics</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">after one year in 1968</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.599" end="00:07:57.840" style="s2">um two economists lived on with me after</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">that and both were economists</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.840" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">absolutely loathed to promote by or</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">hated by my</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.560" style="s2">uh professors and they were nikolai</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:06.080" style="s2">condratiev and joseph schumpeter and</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.560" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">both of them saying the same thing which</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.080" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">the the economy the the national global</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">economy it pulses it goes through</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">periods of um wild excitement</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:18.879" style="s2">and then wild disillusionment and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:19.360" style="s2">despair and then sort of comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.879" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.360" end="00:08:24.160" style="s2">ashes again and you know schumer to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">to obviously about creative destruction</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.160" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.319" style="s2">middle of one of those</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">um periods and these pulses of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.319" end="00:08:31.599" style="s2">globalization</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">have happened before and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.599" end="00:08:34.800" style="s2">particularly as you know happened before</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.200" style="s2">the first world war</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.800" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">um that&#39;s really interesting okay just</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.200" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">come in there the the contractif cycles</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:48.080" style="s2">are normally uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">like you can match them roughly against</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.080" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">major technological innovations</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">and steam engine and and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">computing internal combustion engine and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">i&#39;m a bit concerned that in this because</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">you speak a lot particularly now in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">most recent book the green swans of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">massive opportunity for transformative</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">and continuous dynamic improvement</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">um but then i also saw in a video</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.760" style="s2">in and that volans put out recently</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">somebody from</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">from the singularity university driving</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">this agenda of um</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s all about technological change and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">my sense is that the next contrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">cycle if there is one</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not a technological um</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.360" style="s2">as much as a as a change in in social</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">technology in governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.360" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">in rescaling what we do at what scale</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">and how we do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a re-jigging of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">um economic system</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">in order to rebuild the redundancies</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">at local and regional scale that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:58.880" style="s2">cut</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:10:00.080" style="s2">in the rush for efficiency um not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.880" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">understanding that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.080" end="00:10:04.320" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">well but several things can be true at</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.320" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">the same moment</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">and you know i&#39;m not a technology</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">fetishist i happen to be fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">uh and technology and i do think that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">headed into a a another sort of</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">up wave if you like and um just as a</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">is described as um the u-bend</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">and i think you know i was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">this two and a half years ago and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">and the book was completed at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">december before covert 19.</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">but the diagram shows a period of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">extraordinary evolution macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">cultural all the rest of it driven by uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">many of the technologies you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">but i show a a really sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">catastrophic u-bend uh coming up and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna be over in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">18 months or two years these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:02.800" style="s2">often when they happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">take 12 to 15 years to clear and when</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.800" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">you look out on a transformed landscape</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">the economy has moved</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:11.120" style="s2">and typically it&#39;s always moved east you</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:12.800" style="s2">know it went from china to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.120" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">india the middle east and it went into</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.800" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">parts of europe then it went into the uk</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">with the industrial revolution then it</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:21.279" style="s2">skipped the atlantic to east coast and</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.279" end="00:11:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going back to china again</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">um and i think this is this is one of</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">challenging me the sustainability they</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.279" end="00:11:37.120" style="s2">challenge me at violence by saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:39.480" style="s2">you seem to like growth and i came up</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.120" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">with the concept of green growth back in</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.480" end="00:11:44.079" style="s2">mid-1980s um and the reason i do that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">if you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.079" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">a forest for example and you have a fire</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:49.200" style="s2">that sweeps through then you have</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">regrowth</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.200" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s the same with our economies and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:54.959" style="s2">and what goes exponentially done</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come exponentially up but</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.959" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">something else does and i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:12:02.399" style="s2">got to work out how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">grow that new uh economy</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.399" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">in such a way that we can support if it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">gets to 10 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">in a way that doesn&#39;t wreck the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">and so on so just very briefly to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">the reason why i think we are headed</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">into a new uh condrative cycle</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">is that more technologies are now coming</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">through that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">any point in our history as a species so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">it&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">um satellite remote sensing it&#39;s drones</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">it&#39;s uh big data machine learning</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the internet of everything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:39.040" style="s2">synthetic biology</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">it&#39;s robots all of these things too</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">are starting to come together and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">come binding and hybridizing in ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">uh uh very difficult even for the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">driving those technologies to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">envision and and and predict so i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">the next 30 40</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.639" style="s2">years are going to see a convulsive set</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.639" end="00:12:59.120" style="s2">technology-driven changes whether we</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">like that or not</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.120" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">and i one of the things i worry about is</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">that there are many people in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2">sustainability world</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">who are sort of saying you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">want to go there and we don&#39;t we are i</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">believe that&#39;s a possibility and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">that set of industrial revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.720" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">and we&#39;re sidelined and then i think we</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.720" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">are set up</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">to do this sort of whole unintended</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">uh game all over again so i&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">that technology is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">uh the most important but by god it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">critical and it really does shape our</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">economies and our societies and in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">end it shapes social media and all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:38.639" style="s2">rest of it shapes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2">way that our brains work um sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.639" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">that&#39;s good and sometimes it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:44.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s precisely what i&#39;m a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">concerned about is</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.320" end="00:13:50.240" style="s2">that we yet again haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">paused enough despite this current</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.240" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">opportunity to really reflect</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">um that we&#39;ve had through covet 19 and</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.959" style="s2">and like i have conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">people in in the bay area</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.959" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">and silicon valley that um on the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">hand</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">would say that they&#39;re personally quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:10.880" style="s2">critical with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:14.639" style="s2">technology but that they they feel that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.880" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">exponential tech um is something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.639" end="00:14:19.680" style="s2">isn&#39;t stoppable um but</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">just as much as we&#39;ve now seen that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.680" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">can take radical decisions like</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:25.600" style="s2">grounding all airplanes and and pressing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">a stop on</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.600" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">on global production um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.360" style="s2">it is possible if we have enough will</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">and enough conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.360" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">to to have a more nuanced conversation</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:40.079" style="s2">what technologies to use when and how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">use them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.079" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">and um at what level of proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.639" style="s2">and constant turnover because i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">see how we have the material and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.639" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">energetic basis to keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:58.240" style="s2">making more of these um</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">programmed obsolescence type products</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.240" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">that were currently so addicted to and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">um i&#39;m also concerned that by having</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">like i&#39;ve been in a number of workshops</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">lately where</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">when you bring in somebody from google x</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">to facilitate the workshop</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">then the entire linguistic framing the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">we that we think about the solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">space only leads us towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">um technologically based solutions we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:27.279" style="s2">never have the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">because of the way the workshop is</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.279" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">framed with brilliant minds in the room</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:32.399" style="s2">there isn&#39;t never the opportunity to go</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">upstream</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.399" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">and say are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:39.120" style="s2">things at the right scale how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">refit human patterns back</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.120" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">into the natural patterns that sustain</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:45.839" style="s2">life on earth how did how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">heal in in everything we do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.839" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">this false dualism between humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">nature the cathedral split that is so</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">deeply in our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">that we now believe that technology is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">going to save us</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:01.279" style="s2">from having destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">the capacity of the planet to support</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.279" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">higher life forms if we don&#39;t watch out</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">they for me there&#39;s a balance between</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">yes definitely</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">technological solutions are needed and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:13.360" style="s2">it&#39;s great that they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">and we&#39;re despite the fact that in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:18.000" style="s2">you have the story of the golem and you</p>

<p begin="00:16:18.000" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">and that we&#39;ve for thousands of years we</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">knew that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">there is a sort of be careful with</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">technology because you might</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">what seems like a um servant becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">master and then we have become the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">servants of that master</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:35.279" style="s2">how do you how do you see that nuance</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:37.600" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.279" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">starting well in in a way let me just</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.600" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">say something and then i&#39;ll answer the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">and and um some of your listeners some</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">of your viewers may</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">assume that um i went into business in</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">the 1970s and i&#39;m part of the business</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">world and i just wanted to say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:55.279" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">um at different times i&#39;ve done things</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.279" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">which seemed suicidal or at least</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">semi-crazy to many people</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">who were colleagues so for example in</p>

<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">uh late 1980s we launched a campaign</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">around the concept of green consumerism</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:13.280" style="s2">we did a book called the green consumer</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">guide it sold a million copies in</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.280" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">18 months and we were sued</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">sustainability was sued by</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">three different business units of one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">our clients which was</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">uh imperial chemical industries ici</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">back in the day when it existed and we</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">were also sued by mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">and through my life we have periodically</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">done things which</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.039" end="00:17:36.799" style="s2">we&#39;ve turned down a huge amount of work</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">uh because it doesn&#39;t fit with our</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.799" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">uh values um and and so all i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:44.720" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">greenpeace once described us as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.720" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">greenpeace and pinstripe</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">suits in the sense that we were taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">that agenda into</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:53.440" style="s2">boardrooms and c-suites and so on i just</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">put that on the table to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.440" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">don&#39;t make assumptions to the audience</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.600" style="s2">about where we&#39;re coming from and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">i mentioned my original training as a</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.600" end="00:18:03.600" style="s2">city planner</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">and my thesis though was on urban</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.600" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">and that was not just structural and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">economic it was also</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:11.600" style="s2">social and it was environmental uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">regeneration and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.600" end="00:18:18.080" style="s2">i abs it&#39;s wired into the core</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">of of who i am and the way i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.080" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">then let me answer your question which</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">when i went to uh silicon valley with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">couple of colleagues i didn&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">four or five years ago i i asked</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">everyone we met</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">um the same question and the question</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">have you ever heard of thomas mitchell</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">jr</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">and not a single person we met on that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">trip had ever heard of thomas mitchell</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">jr and i would let that say</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">stage say well perhaps you there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">reason why you should because he was</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">at his peak in the 1920s and 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:52.559" style="s2">brilliant chemical engineer</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">he had over 100 patents to his name</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.559" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">um and i just very quickly ran through</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">three stories about</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">him which one is that he came up with a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">brilliant breakthrough technology</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:06.640" style="s2">which was leaded gasoline</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:08.720" style="s2">which was a wonderful fuel efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">innovation but actually poisoned the</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.720" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">nervous systems of millions of young</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">people around the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">he then came up with freon sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">classic chlorofluorocarbons</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">and blew a hole in the stratospheric</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">ozone layer</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">and you know he&#39;s been described as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">single organism</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:26.080" style="s2">in earth&#39;s history that has done most</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2">damage to the planet and yet these</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.080" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">entrepreneurs these innovators these</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:30.400" style="s2">investors</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">had never heard of him so unintended</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.400" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">consequences was</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">written in to his dna and then as as</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">many of your viewers and listeners will</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">he sadly contracted polio in the early</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:44.480" style="s2">1940s he built himself a semi-robotic</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">bed to get himself</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.480" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">in and out of bed without nursing care</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">and it strangled him</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">and i just i told that story to these</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">people just say</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:55.039" style="s2">have you thought about the longer term</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">unintentional consequences of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.039" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and the answer was glib it</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re thinking about that the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:03.120" style="s2">time but i then asked and who from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:04.640" style="s2">sustainability world is coming into</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.120" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">challenge at close quarters</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.640" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">the work that you&#39;re doing and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">answer was almost nobody</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s partly because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">sustainability world has largely been</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">focused on</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">the industries that caused the problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:18.799" style="s2">last time around so</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">oil and and coal and automotive and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">aerospace and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">all that sort of stuff and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">looking into synthetic biology we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">looking at the people who are starting</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">to think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.840" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">how do you start to do deep ocean mining</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">and things like that i mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">some people clearly are but i think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s where i feel we should be leaning</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">into the future leaning into the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">of technology not because we believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.559" style="s2">that technology will ultimately save us</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.000" style="s2">but because unless we&#39;re in there</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.559" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">we can&#39;t shape the culture that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.000" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">exactly the culture you&#39;ve described</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">tech rules everything else and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">you know sort of we&#39;ll discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">later no no i i</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">i completely and utterly um</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">understand that you are in there to stay</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">in the conversation in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">help um to be at the table um</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">means that you can at least try to shape</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">discourse and at the same time because</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:16.559" style="s2">like we because of that that respect and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">and your</p>

<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:29.600" style="s2">against your knowledge of where people</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.200" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">have worked for since the beginning of</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">and i see certain patterns that life</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">follows</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">that i feel we&#39;ve left the path</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">of like where we are life of course and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:05.600" style="s2">to some extent</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s i believe that it is a mental</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">to oppose technology and nature in the</p>

<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">part of the biophysical system that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">actually the biosphere and for</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">from my definition of nature life is a</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">part of it somehow but it is maladaptive</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:31.840" style="s2">very often and it is um destroying</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">into those natural patterns using the</p>

<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">by a regional scale healthy</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:02.159" style="s2">regional economies that still trade</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.159" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">like again the the gentleman from</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">video um was sort of speaking the</p>

<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">calling the exponential 20s and he said</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.200" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s still that model of you need</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">and intelligence and good people in</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.320" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">these networks if they</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">put their minds to how do we facilitate</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">how we use technology no i i totally</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">agree i mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">as it happens i know nick hahn he came</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">to my 70th birthday</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">party last year i i think he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">gentler end of that singularity</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">university and exponential</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">world i think he&#39;s well aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">grand challenges as they call them that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">we now face as a species</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:45.840" style="s2">and he&#39;s trying to position exponential</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">solutions in a way that will appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.840" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">corporate people the googles i mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">who helped fund singularity university</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">of course but um</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">just a couple of things about your</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">points around biology and i know i i</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">admire your</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">biological roots immensely and i i</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make it sound as though i i</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">every subject i take</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">begin i i i drop out of um</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">but i when i was at school i gave up</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">biology or</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">it was given up for me because i refused</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">to cut up animals</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:18.960" style="s2">and um so i i lost that but then</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.480" style="s2">in the 70s and my 20s i came back and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.960" end="00:25:21.200" style="s2">started to write for new scientists one</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.480" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.200" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2">science magazines and i did that for</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">five years</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">and and because of that i got to meet</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">some of the most extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">scientists and then i edited and as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">hobby in the evenings</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">a new biotechnology newsletter and i got</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">to sit</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">next to nobel prize-winning</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">molecular biologists as they sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">docked</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">proteins on the screen and so on and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">became</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">very interested in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">different aspects of biology</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">including the use of biological</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">concepts and frameworks in thinking</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">about our economies and our societies so</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">for example when i was doing sociology</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">which is what i went to on to do after</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">economics</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">uh first time around was um the work of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">e.o wilson at</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">wilson who who talked about sociobiology</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">which most sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">loathed because it reduced us to the uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">you know the the the status of an animal</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">and and uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">compared us to you know ant colonies and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">i think he was much wiser than that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:29.200" style="s2">think there was</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:31.039" style="s2">a great deal about what he was um</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.200" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">talking about which we could still learn</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.039" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">from and much more recently i i was on</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">the board for six years of janine</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">benius&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:41.600" style="s2">biomimicry 3.8 and i i love</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">some of that biomimicry thinking i you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.600" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">know i and i it goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">some of the reading i did almost a child</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">people like darcy thompson and so on</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">on structure and form and and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">just finally i you know i live in london</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">uh and i you know it&#39;s a city and i love</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">cities and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.679" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">as a city planner i i learned relatively</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">early to appreciate both their strengths</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">um and now you know cities as incubators</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">of pandemics</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">are are sort of back in the news but</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">london just very recently</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:15.840" style="s2">declared itself the world&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">national park city</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.840" end="00:27:20.399" style="s2">and that for me is the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">conceptual approach that you know i</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.399" end="00:27:24.399" style="s2">welcome where people start to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think of your city as a city as</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.399" end="00:27:26.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve always thought of it and imagined</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.799" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">think of it as an ecosystem and yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">got parks it&#39;s got green space and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.760" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">street trees and all the rest of it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">what can we collectively do</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:38.799" style="s2">to make it much more of a living</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">organism that benefits</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.799" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">the health of everyone here and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">very much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:46.399" style="s2">in people&#39;s minds now since kervin 19</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">hit and they&#39;ve been able to hear</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.399" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">birdsong and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:50.559" style="s2">all the rest of it it&#39;s astonishing how</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">in this country uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.559" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">the the uk the interest in wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">always high</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">but just rocketed up uh in in the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">six months or so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">you know i felt for me because here in</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">spain the lockdown was very</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">intense in terms of we weren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">allowed out to exercise or</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">for a short walk so i i literally was</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">locked into a flat for 51 days with</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">very little connection to green nature</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">or the ocean or</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">the things that nourish me every day</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">normally and</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:24.240" style="s2">and i really felt it in my body how</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">intense it can be when you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.240" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">nature deficit disorder like i remember</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">walking back</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">um from taking the rubbish out and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:35.039" style="s2">the the recycling and um stepping under</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">a tree</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.039" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">and really noticing that i hadn&#39;t stood</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">under the canopy of a tree for</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">weeks and it it felt like something was</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">rushing back into me it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">really quite phytochemical</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:53.279" style="s2">but in terms of cities</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">there&#39;s of course that&#39;s the huge agenda</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.279" end="00:28:59.520" style="s2">now how do we deal with our</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">massive cities and like 19 certainly has</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.520" end="00:29:02.559" style="s2">made some people reflect of whether they</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">want to live in</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.559" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">large cities so there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">some some rearranging happening for at</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">least the privileged ones that have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">choice to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">to decide where to go but even in india</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:14.399" style="s2">i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard that a lot of people who were</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.399" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">fleeing into the cities</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">to find the better life so so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:22.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">are now fleeing back into the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.640" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">out of the slums because yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">the conditions and daniel i i would love</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">to ask you a question which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:34.080" style="s2">technology a little bit about business a</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.080" end="00:29:39.919" style="s2">um you know cities and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">how do you view the human species how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.919" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">you view</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">the you know people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:46.320" style="s2">exosomatic</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">evolution where where we stop evolving</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.320" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">biologically to</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:51.360" style="s2">to some degree and we evolve through our</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">technology and so on how do you think</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.360" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">about that do you think that&#39;s stoppable</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">do you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">something that um is a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">i personally feel that we have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">chance of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:13.120" style="s2">a longer and deepening arch of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">evolutionary journey</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.120" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">if we step into the maturity</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">of um precisely what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">earlier the technology shape</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">ultimately ends up shaping how we think</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">i lately</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">um you know a couple of years ago i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">working with guy education and i was</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:32.080" style="s2">creating these flash cards that help</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">people have conversations around</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:38.880" style="s2">the local implementations of the sdgs</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">and and while i was working on those i</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.880" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">i used buckminster fuller&#39;s advice as my</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:46.159" style="s2">sort of design briefing of if you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">to change the way people think</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.159" end="00:30:49.520" style="s2">don&#39;t tell them what to think give them</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">a tool</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.520" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">the use of which will change the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">they think and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">that giving myself that design brief was</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">very useful and</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">very very productive for for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">particular project but lately i&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">back to that sentence</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">and realized how much maybe also</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">partially because of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">too much time online too much time in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">front of a computer and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">feeling that in my own body i began to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">realize wait a minute this applies to</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">every technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.320" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">money um computers cars</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">books exactly and the printing press was</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">a massive</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">step in that direction so it changes the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">way we think</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">and yes if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">also take gertie&#39;s advice that he who</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see nature everywhere sees a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">nowhere in the right light</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:41.360" style="s2">into a deeper dimension we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">somehow come to peace with technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.360" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">being part</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:49.840" style="s2">of what we do but i but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.840" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">adaptive evolutionary path that we now</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">need to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">to my mind isn&#39;t predominantly a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">technological one but it&#39;s a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">and biological evolution is too slow</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">to respond to the converging crises that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">um caused by not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:12.240" style="s2">systemic connections and not</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">like by the power of science and</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.240" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:16.799" style="s2">came through the reductionist method the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">shadows</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.799" end="00:32:20.480" style="s2">and it gave us a lot of wonderful things</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">but the shadow side of that was that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.480" end="00:32:23.919" style="s2">it compartmentalized</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">our knowledge and our awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.919" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">world in into</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">silos that now reinforced by</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">professions and academic disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">make it really hard for us to really</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:37.200" style="s2">think systemically about the mess where</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re doing such a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.200" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">brilliant job because you&#39;ve started so</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">many different disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">um and and and you you&#39;re clearly a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">generalist</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">and informed by so many different um and</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:52.480" style="s2">you wilson said that the future will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">the future leaders will have to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.480" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">generalists and synthesizers because</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">because we have a lot of information big</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">data out there but we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">very little wisdom and for me wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">comes through cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">and wise use of technology can only</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.159" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">if we do it in attunement to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">biophysical realities of the ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">and bioregions we&#39;re in so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">so for me um</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the evolutionary rite of</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">passage that our species</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">is currently going through that that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:28.399" style="s2">have exactly that conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">question you asked me is it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.399" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">to what extent will technology play a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">role but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">create a culture that uses technology</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">wisely at the right scale</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">otherwise i think we will blow it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting i i would love to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:46.399" style="s2">able to take the lids off</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">our brains and understand how you and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.399" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">both see and the world think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.600" style="s2">culture because</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:53.120" style="s2">when i think about culture um i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.600" end="00:33:55.840" style="s2">about civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.120" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">and and their decline and and and fall</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.840" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">uh eventually uh but i also think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">soft and hard culture</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:04.240" style="s2">and and soft is around who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">it&#39;s our values and it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.240" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s our interactions and it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">conversations and so on the hard stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.840" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">is the buildings we build and the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">that they over time start to interact</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">our lives and shape them and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">the technologies you use for mobility</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:20.320" style="s2">and communication and so on</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">and i you mentioned uh about mr fuller</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.320" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">and and um</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">it&#39;s true that i&#39;ve given up a fair</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">number of disciplines along the way but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">the one i&#39;ve always loved uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">is history because i think if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">understand a certain amount about</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">history you can see a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">future as others have um said and i once</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">had a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">absolutely magical breakfast with um</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.919" style="s2">about mr fuller and reykjavik in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.919" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">and his capacity to explain</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">really concepts complex science in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">very i mean for example we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">about the oceans at one point and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">you take a a a stainless steel sphere</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">as high as uh i was at the time six foot</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">he said</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">and you breathe on it the depth the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">condensation of your breath</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">is the average depth of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">world ocean</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:11.200" style="s2">and i i found that out of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:12.160" style="s2">including this one i learned stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.200" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">sticks with me</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.160" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">much to a much greater degree than</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">endless classroom uh work or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">although even in classrooms you meet</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">teachers who are extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">individuals who</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.160" style="s2">who have that capacity i mean i remember</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">learning spanish to a degree for one</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.160" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">year when i was about</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">14 and the person who taught me had</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">fought</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">on the republican side and the spanish</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">civil war</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">he didn&#39;t bring very much of that into</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">the classroom but because he had gone</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.119" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">through that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">there was this extraordinary existential</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:47.280" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">and it had partly to do with history it</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.280" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">had partly to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:53.040" style="s2">challenges which in different ways we</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">all face at different stages in our life</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.040" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">and then that sort of question of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">sort of future are we headed into what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">we uh do we want and i remember having</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">early 80s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:05.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve been pursuing for years the science</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">fiction</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.599" end="00:36:10.240" style="s2">author frank herbert because he did dune</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:11.920" style="s2">i&#39;d read that it was a set book when i</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.240" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">was doing sociology religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.920" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">at university and i wanted to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">him and he lived in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">the pacific northwest i have family uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">in seattle and around that area so i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">often be there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">try and find him and every time i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">there he was somewhere else and finally</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">we met</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:32.240" style="s2">in london um a couple of years before he</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">died</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.240" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">um and he he was just going back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">seattle and then up to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:40.640" style="s2">the olympic peninsula and he asked me</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">where i&#39;d come from and i said i just</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.640" end="00:36:45.839" style="s2">come back from</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">seattle as it happens and and he in dune</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.839" end="00:36:49.680" style="s2">as you know he described uh as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.680" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">that built around very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">sophisticated technology to cope with</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">extreme environmental conditions</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">and for me when i think of culture i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">thinking about the fremen culture in in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">dune or</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.920" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">or whatever it is and you know he he</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">turned out to be the most extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">environmentalist</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">and he described trips that he&#39;d made by</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">playing down the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">west coast of the united states and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">seeing the change in the landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">the stripping out of the forests and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">and he had solar panels even then on his</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">home and so on his draw</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">is extraordinarily um i just think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">blessed to have these people</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">and we should seek them out wherever we</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">can find them</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:31.520" style="s2">absolutely the dedication in the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">book of the dune</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.520" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">trilogy is to all the dry land</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">future yeah and that&#39;s what the entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.119" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">is is dedicated to it that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">level of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">premonition or or clarity about where we</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">were heading</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:51.119" style="s2">and like i completely agree i wish i</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">wish i could practice the voice of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.119" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">bene jesuit</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">um it took me 40 pages to get into that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">damn book and then suddenly i was in</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">that world but it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">it was quite a shock um and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">somebody sent me a</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">two days ago a video of um</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">almost a decade-long project in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">yemen</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:15.839" style="s2">um where they&#39;ve been bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">desertified land which was um</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.839" end="00:38:19.040" style="s2">desertified because governments changed</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.040" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">policy and controls and they</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">they&#39;re basically trying to sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">probably come across the scheme but</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:31.680" style="s2">harness uh acute rainwater</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:33.599" style="s2">wall it in have it go back into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.680" end="00:38:34.960" style="s2">aquifers and now they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.599" end="00:38:36.640" style="s2">shrubs and they&#39;ve got grasses and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.960" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve got trees and so on coming</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:39.839" style="s2">back and the prospect is the rivers will</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">come back</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.839" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">as well and this that stuff gives me</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">chills because that&#39;s not only frank</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">herbert territory</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the that&#39;s the world we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">now construct for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">absolutely but that&#39;s that&#39;s again where</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.599" style="s2">we need to find</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">that cultural maturity to have the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:39:00.400" style="s2">how do we do it because we can reforest</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:02.240" style="s2">with large corporations coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.400" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">regenerative space and saying oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.240" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve now found our way and where</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">monsanto starts large monocultural</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:13.119" style="s2">reforestation</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">plantations with um partnerships with</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.119" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">the nature conservancy</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">so there&#39;s strange new bedfellows</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">happening um</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">all around the globe and and and yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:26.079" style="s2">maybe we need a little bit of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">uh incremental changes that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.079" end="00:39:30.880" style="s2">that create the enabling conditions for</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">true transformative change to happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.880" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">um but if we don&#39;t have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">around how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">like for example it&#39;s it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">reframe the entire</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">climate change problem um as a healing</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.119" style="s2">of the water cycle through</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.720" end="00:39:48.680" style="s2">biosequestration</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.119" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">and um geotherapy rather than</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.680" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">geoengineering based uh methods of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">going beyond biosequestration or finding</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">there are few</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">bio-assisted ways of shifting carbon</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">from the biological carbon cycle which</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">is only 300 years</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">and therefore not long enough to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">sequester the amount of carbon we put</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">in the long run we also need ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">sequestering the carbon into the g</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">geological carbon cycle which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">much longer and and that would then</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">enable us to</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">rebalance um global climate patterns to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:26.160" style="s2">a point that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">that we don&#39;t run over the climate cliff</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.160" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">but but that&#39;s precisely where we</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">it&#39;s we have to have this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">about scale</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:37.440" style="s2">um because so many people now say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.440" end="00:40:41.480" style="s2">let&#39;s do regenerative let&#39;s scale it up</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:44.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.480" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">regenerative practice is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.160" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">place based and place sourced it comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">the biocultural uniqueness of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">communities and their bioregion or their</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">their life sheds and um</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:01.599" style="s2">that&#39;s where i feel that that if we want</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">to really be transformative</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.599" end="00:41:05.520" style="s2">yes we need to have the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.440" style="s2">with business but in the sense of saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.520" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">did you not see what happens to global</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.440" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">supply lines under covet</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">19 and and this is still the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">of that domino effect that is still</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">running like i feel a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:20.560" style="s2">saying when are we coming out and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:23.680" style="s2">they&#39;re thinking they can can restart</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.560" end="00:41:25.359" style="s2">the the um production but um what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.680" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">actually happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.359" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">upstream in so many not just their</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">suppliers but the suppliers of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">suppliers</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:34.319" style="s2">are all so globally interlinked and many</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:38.079" style="s2">of them have gone bust or</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.319" end="00:41:41.520" style="s2">have had different periods of shutdown</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.079" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">and and therefore we we see entire um</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.520" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">areas of business completely unable to</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:46.880" style="s2">restart</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">and what we can learn from that is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.880" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:51.720" style="s2">even the big companies need to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:54.400" style="s2">about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.720" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">decentralize our production and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">there was already a beginning of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:58.640" style="s2">conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">decentralized manufacturing and even</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.640" end="00:42:02.000" style="s2">large companies started to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:04.400" style="s2">we have one factory in</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.000" end="00:42:05.520" style="s2">asia in one factory in north america or</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.400" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">central america</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.520" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">um but my sense is that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">we could take the best of technology and</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">the best of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">co-creative transformative innovation to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">reinvent production and consumption in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">way that it</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:25.040" style="s2">is more biomaterial space that it the</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:26.960" style="s2">very production</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.040" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">of the materials that we use for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.960" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">products we use in the region</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">actually drive the regeneration of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">local ecosystem because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.720" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">necessary to have more forests because</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to have healthy rivers</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">and productive um and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s where i believe is the fine line</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:46.240" style="s2">between high technology and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.480" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">more permaculture eco</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.240" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">vision of of that future is that because</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:52.560" style="s2">there&#39;s so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">we also need to be open enough to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.560" end="00:42:55.119" style="s2">maybe some of these biomaterials have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">be grown</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.119" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">in test tubes using synthetic biology</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">we have to be careful to do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:05.520" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">create unintended side effects and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.520" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">the the wisdom of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">a lot of these elders we mentioned is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">if we do things at a scale where</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">feedback is relatively fast</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">we can of course correct for unintended</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">consequences much faster</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">if we create global systems we the the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:29.920" style="s2">feedback is too slow</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">no i agree and i you know as i listen to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">you i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m both delighted that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a wider conversation evolving</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.000" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:38.400" style="s2">we&#39;re having this that discussion now</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:39.760" style="s2">and for a very particular reason which</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.400" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">is that when i look back at what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:42.560" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">over the years uh part of it has been</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">and and in some ways uh valuable but i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">i&#39;ve been described as grit in the</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:02.640" style="s2">know i&#39;m an irritant and and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:04.560" style="s2">you know some of these people if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.640" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">could throw me out all us out they would</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.560" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">gladly do so but</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:10.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in there to hold people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:13.839" style="s2">attention and also</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.400" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">uh to some degree feet um to the fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:16.960" style="s2">and one of the reasons i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">one of the ways in which i&#39;ve provoked</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.960" end="00:44:20.560" style="s2">is by strapping</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.480" style="s2">unlike concepts together so sort of</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.480" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">i i did it with green growth and greek</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">whatever it happens to be but they</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.280" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">just through wanting to adapt language</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">to the circumstances in which they find</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">they they sort of um make language</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">uh potentially powerful language uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">quite often</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:29.040" style="s2">increasingly meaningless and so in</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">talking about regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.040" end="00:45:34.560" style="s2">regenerative capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">i&#39;m absolutely determined to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.560" end="00:45:38.640" style="s2">that if we can get the attention of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">business community then we can bring the</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.640" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">concepts into the boardroom and so on</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">but do it in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">hold ourselves to account to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:49.839" style="s2">that uh you know we don&#39;t simply give</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">people new toys to play with</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.839" end="00:45:53.119" style="s2">uh but this actually helps drive uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">wheelchair</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">i i i mean in my book designing</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">regenerative cultures i also</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">purposefully um included</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">what i would consider a paradox into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:05.839" style="s2">title because you don&#39;t design cultures</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">cultures emerge</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.839" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">through the sum total of all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">relationships interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:12.319" style="s2">communications that flow among people</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.319" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">our enactment of it constantly and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">reenactment of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">um so so you can&#39;t really design and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">predict them in a sort of engineering</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">type way</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">but then we can design for um positive</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">and to come back to the subtitle of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">new book and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">i think it&#39;s it&#39;s i i&#39;ve had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">conversation about that subtitle with</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">people lately</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">and previously i also had a number of</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">similar conversations with people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:45.920" style="s2">had initially supported john fullerton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">white paper development of um which was</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">in the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">part of the white paper was always</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">called regenerative um</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">economics yeah and people and he asked a</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">white group of people to contribute and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">comment on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.319" style="s2">and then when it when the final version</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">of the white paper was um</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.319" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">published it was called regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">capitalism and um there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">section of people who were offended by</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">that and i actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">did i actually said no this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">because he&#39;s not talking to you your</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">allies already he&#39;s trying to bring this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">into a different</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">arena his former colleagues in on wall</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">street and in the banking world</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">and and so it it is actually a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">use of language</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">because he&#39;s he&#39;s trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:30.720" style="s2">engagement through it</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">but when when i posted recently i thank</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.720" end="00:47:34.559" style="s2">you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">for the copy and wonderful dedications</p>

<p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">posted about</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.280" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">your book and it ensued a whole</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">i should actually copy it and share it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">because people get triggered by the word</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">capitalism people get triggered by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">word growth</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">and i i as a biologist agree that it</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.599" style="s2">depends on what kind of growth and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">not that we like i find it dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.599" end="00:48:03.359" style="s2">to be devil growth altogether i actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:06.640" style="s2">also personally</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.359" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">feel that to the devil capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.640" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">and the word capital altogether is is</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.640" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">wrong we because it&#39;s it&#39;s a stock and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.640" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">flow model</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:16.640" style="s2">that that is useful to to to work with</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:19.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.640" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">um but where do you sit with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.760" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">because basically there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">trying to redesign or reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.880" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">capitalism to make capitalism green to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:30.400" style="s2">make capitalism regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.400" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a whole other group of</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.400" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">people saying that&#39;s the wrong place to</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">because there are fundamental issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">um ownership of the means of production</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">and so on that um the capital</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">capitalism can&#39;t be retrofitted we need</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:52.800" style="s2">reinvent a new economic system from from</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">the bottom up and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.800" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">where do you sit on on that spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:00.160" style="s2">well it&#39;s funny i did a</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:49:03.119" style="s2">a a webinar yesterday in new york</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">uh and one of it was around faith and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.119" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">leadership and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:08.240" style="s2">most of the people around the table were</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">from the business world i mean there was</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.240" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:13.920" style="s2">yale professors and so on but um the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:15.839" style="s2">whole black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.920" end="00:49:16.960" style="s2">issue was absolutely the forefront of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.839" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">people&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.960" end="00:49:21.680" style="s2">minds of course and and rightly so</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">um and one of the things i said part way</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">through uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:26.240" style="s2">was if you go back into your own family</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">histories</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.240" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">you&#39;ll find all sorts of stuff some of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">the stuff you&#39;ll be pleased to see and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">some of the stuff you really want</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">so in both my elaine and my wife and</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">it was endemic in in britain and her</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.079" end="00:49:48.880" style="s2">family fled to the um caribbean to</p>

<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:02.559" style="s2">a phrase in english which is when my</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.359" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">ship comes in</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.559" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">and what it means is when my ship comes</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">i think a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">declare that capitalism is intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">evil or the</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">and there&#39;s nothing</p>

<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:55.599" style="s2">think we look back through history and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.040" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">we see</p>

<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">get close to it but we won&#39;t get there</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.839" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">and partly i i was shaped by going out</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">and working in the early 70s</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.400" style="s2">on alternative technology farms where</p>

<p begin="00:51:31.599" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">and most of those places become became</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">like lunatic asylums because</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">you know they were intentional</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">communities people came with all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:44.240" style="s2">their problems from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.319" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">wider world and and um it sort of didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:47.599" style="s2">now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2">a little bit more confident that we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.520" end="00:51:55.119" style="s2">take the system that we have and bend it</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:57.359" style="s2">uh over decades and generations</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.119" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">than i am that we can all suddenly after</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.359" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">covert 19</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">so to go out and set up our family farms</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">as a solar roof</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">and and and create a completely</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">dramatizing for effect but</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">um i think i think we&#39;re very complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:18.480" style="s2">i think um environmental crime</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">not just human rights related crimes are</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.480" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">embedded in our entire history of a</p>

<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">and yet and yet and yet along the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">certain communities certain parts of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">civilizations have worked out how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.319" style="s2">live</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">much more um in much greater alignment</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:37.200" style="s2">uh natural systems and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">really where we&#39;ve got to try and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.200" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">drive the conversation and we&#39;ve got and</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">if we leave</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">capitalists untouched by that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re going to be swept</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.079" style="s2">aside</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">i think that is the you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.640" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">three horizon framework</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">um yes that in the second horizon where</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:57.599" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">um as john amazing put it when</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.599" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">hospice working the degenerative</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">capitalist system</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">and not out of existence but to to to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">state where we only maintain</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">what we do want to maintain from it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.880" style="s2">we&#39;re midwifing a more regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">viable system into the world the third</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.880" end="00:53:15.680" style="s2">horizon</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">in that space in between the the second</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.680" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">horizon it&#39;s all about dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">navigation</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">um it&#39;s solutions are never final</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">i completely agree with you i think too</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">somehow when they speak about</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">sustainability or regeneration or any of</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:36.319" style="s2">these these visionary goals of we can do</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.119" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">better um they</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.319" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">somehow begin to speak about it as if</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:42.480" style="s2">there is an end point that if we get all</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">those pieces in place</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.480" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">then everything will be fine and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.720" style="s2">sustainable or regenerative and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">personally believe because the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.720" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">system continues to change</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">journey of learning and apprenticeship</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.920" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">that never ends that we might as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">settle into understanding that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:07.599" style="s2">temporary and that that&#39;s why in my book</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:09.599" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.599" end="00:54:10.800" style="s2">do this little bit of epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.599" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">aikido of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.800" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">focusing so much on questions rather</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">than solutions and answers because</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:20.800" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re a little bit over um</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">confident as a species that we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.800" end="00:54:24.160" style="s2">design</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">solutions and answers that are final um</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.160" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">when history has always showed us that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">the well most well-intended solutions</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">have turned into tomorrow&#39;s problems</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">so why would we think um that our</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">solutions would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.800" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">differently but but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:42.079" style="s2">in this journey of trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.079" end="00:54:48.400" style="s2">the big money big business engaged</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:50.079" style="s2">it&#39;s such a fine line for me personally</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.400" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">to stay because i always</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.079" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">again bachmann fuller said in the end</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">only integrity is going to matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:55:01.280" style="s2">so so i i check in with myself a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.920" end="00:55:04.559" style="s2">what do i do and what do i not do and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.280" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">for me there is this dance of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.559" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">engaging business and taking like how</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:11.119" style="s2">many consultants have i heard</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">yeah but we can&#39;t take our clients that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.119" end="00:55:15.280" style="s2">far they&#39;re not ready yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">um this is as far as i can have the</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.280" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">conversation with them</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">and i i i honor people who are sticking</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">in that field but</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">but the minute you do that you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">that knife&#39;s edge between</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">being the great and the oyster and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">transformative change in the and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">the seeding of new thought forms that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">so necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">at the same time if it means</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:43.599" style="s2">incremental solutions then then it</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">becomes part of what will stefan call</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.599" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">predatory delay like</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:50.079" style="s2">um and and and yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">i again there&#39;s no clear-cut answer to</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.079" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">this we i think we&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">we&#39;re all sometimes part of helping a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">company</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">do his their predatory delay game and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">and sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:03.760" style="s2">plant a seed that really leadership to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:04.400" style="s2">the point that they&#39;re really taking the</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.760" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">whole thing in</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.400" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">a whole new direction yeah no it it it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:11.760" style="s2">it that&#39;s absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">and and i think alex uh stefan with uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.760" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">predatory delay has sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">really spotlighted an instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">part of what business does which is to</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">protect its sunk</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">capital its you know vested interests</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:28.640" style="s2">and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">just to again to sort of say that in</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.640" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">in a way that we&#39;ve tried to exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:34.720" style="s2">you were saying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">sort of test ourselves against whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.720" end="00:56:38.000" style="s2">we&#39;re really making</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">the sort of difference that we declare</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.000" end="00:56:42.559" style="s2">we want to make um we did a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">studies quite some years ago but where</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.559" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">we looked at lobbying activities at a</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">time when</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">by companies by at the time when nobody</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">was talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">and when two of our biggest clients uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">asked us to shut that project down we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:57.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">um and and uh i&#39;m very pleased that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.440" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t and now you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:02.880" style="s2">people like influence map who are who</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">are tracking that in much greater</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.880" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">um uh detail we shouldn&#39;t be naive uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">the and in fact the closer to</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">transformation we come the more the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">entrenched incumbent industries will</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">fight back</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">and they won&#39;t do it cleanly and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:17.200" style="s2">won&#39;t do it transparently they&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">behind the scenes in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.200" end="00:57:22.079" style="s2">uh different ways so i i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">nikhan came to my</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.079" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">70th it was meant to be a birthday party</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">it turned into a conference but</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">um one of the things i said there and</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.839" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">people keep reminding me was</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:35.200" style="s2">i think you know yes i&#39;m 70 but i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">the next 10 to 15 years are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.200" end="00:57:39.520" style="s2">by far the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:40.000" style="s2">exciting and by far the most challenging</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.520" end="00:57:42.720" style="s2">and by far</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.000" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">the most dangerous of my entire working</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.720" end="00:57:45.599" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">uh to date and i say that because i</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.599" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">think all sorts of things are now coming</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">to a head and they&#39;re starting to feed</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">off each other so you know wildlife</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">trafficking leads to</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">a pandemic leads to a</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.799" style="s2">of time that depresses</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">uh greenhouse gas emissions and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.799" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">we&#39;re living in a system</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:10.559" style="s2">but without the governance or the</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">political or the economic systems that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">they and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:15.119" style="s2">really enable us to do justice to the</p>

<p begin="00:58:15.119" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">uh created um and one of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:20.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been asked</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">and it goes back to a slightly sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.720" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">point we&#39;ve already discussed which</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">is the role of technology um</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;ve been wondering whether the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">human brain</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">as it&#39;s currently configured you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">the standard issue one that we all have</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">is really fit for purpose and what comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">next and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.520" style="s2">if we go on our current development</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">trajectory and things become more and</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.520" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">more complicated faster and faster and</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">and the only way i can see of dealing</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:49.359" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">if that continues is artificial</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.359" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">intelligence artificial wisdom call it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:54.559" style="s2">what you will but</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">uh but at the moment all the signs are</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.559" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">that ai and machine learning are going</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:58:59.440" style="s2">off in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">trajectory which will not be uh wildly</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">uh on that uh journey so i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:06.160" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">is our biggest and most important uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.160" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">investment and</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:12.079" style="s2">we do quite a lot in that uh area and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s still one of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.079" end="00:59:15.119" style="s2">jangling questions in the back of my</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.119" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what we do to failure no i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">like you opened up a big box there with</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:26.319" style="s2">for me ais is something that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:29.599" style="s2">be careful with because</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.319" end="00:59:33.119" style="s2">um what ai does really well is</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.599" end="00:59:36.799" style="s2">integrate quantitative data</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.119" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">and and analyze it and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.799" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">the problem about how life works is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">and the life enabling conditions</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.720" end="00:59:48.559" style="s2">at multiple scales are all about</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:52.400" style="s2">qualitative relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.559" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">that can be somewhat abstracted into</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.400" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">analysis and data but not in their</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.839" end="00:59:59.680" style="s2">entirety the it&#39;s it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">maura bateson is trying to bring in with</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.680" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">warm data labs this understanding that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s a contextual nuance that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:07.920" style="s2">in the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.920" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">siloed data that actually is much richer</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">but that ai has absolutely zero idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:20.720" style="s2">how to access and and so to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">into a kind of um jack fresno type</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.720" end="01:00:26.319" style="s2">um future of um</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">of having the scientists and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.319" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">computer and the big ai</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">um divi out and and calculate in real</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:34.559" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">global resource flows and then everybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.559" end="01:00:40.000" style="s2">gets some sort of proportion</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">i i find that extremely dystopian um</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.000" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">i do too and is a question that we need</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">to like our</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.200" end="01:00:49.040" style="s2">i think our brains might not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">cope with the future that we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.040" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">heading towards creating with our</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">technologies but again just as much as</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve designed the economic system and</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">we can fundamentally redesign it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve designed those technologies and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">could if there is will</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.960" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">change which technologies we use and how</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">and and that&#39;s exactly where where this</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:11.200" style="s2">this big question comes in of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">address</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.200" end="01:01:17.760" style="s2">um like also at your birthday party</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">nick hurd said the only way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.760" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">we um can solve these complex converging</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">crises is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:27.760" style="s2">if we find a way to break down also the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:29.680" style="s2">silos between</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.760" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">the different sectors business</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.680" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">governance and civil society</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:38.400" style="s2">and because they also make us</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:40.400" style="s2">like we&#39;ve created a structural this</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.400" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">functionality and how these three</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.400" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">sectors can pass blame to each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">again because of globalized economic</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">systems in globalized production it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">even easier to</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">pass the bug if it is focused on</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:54.480" style="s2">regional performance into how are we</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">doing in our region</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">regenerating social cohesion better</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">communities better education better</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:01.839" style="s2">better healthier ecosystems how do we</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">turn cities</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.839" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">into salutogenic processes like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">talking cities earlier</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.520" end="01:02:11.039" style="s2">patrick geddes over a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">reminded us that good city planning has</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.039" end="01:02:15.760" style="s2">to be in the context of of the region</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:17.359" style="s2">he was the first bioregionalist yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.760" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">before all indigenous cultures which</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.359" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">were all</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.920" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">by the regionals um the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:27.200" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s education that&#39;s why i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">i&#39;ve put so much effort in my life in</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.200" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">into education because while it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.920" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">the opportunities that we face</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.880" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">what would you do i mean in in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">we all do that day to day and</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:16.000" style="s2">and yesterday we we know we decide how</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">to sort of invest our time and effort</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.000" end="01:04:18.160" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:23.680" style="s2">i suppose what lies behind the question</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">is i mean in a sense you see the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.680" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">the nature and scale of the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">that the species now has to sort of</p>

<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">regenerative capitalism i i&#39;ve chosen</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">that phrase simply because it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:54.000" style="s2">slightly provocative it does make people</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">think and rethink but if if if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.000" end="01:04:56.240" style="s2">suddenly could do whatever you wanted to</p>

<p begin="01:04:56.240" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">what what would it be</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:04.640" style="s2">um well that&#39;s a interesting question</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">because i&#39;m currently in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">phase where when you earlier i said we</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:11.599" style="s2">can&#39;t all post covert go and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">and create our self-sufficiency farm</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.599" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">with our solar panels</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:17.599" style="s2">um i mean i came from that dream many</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:20.640" style="s2">many years ago when</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.599" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">in 1999 i moved to southern spain trying</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.640" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">an eco village and environmental</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">um of showing people how to live the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:31.359" style="s2">solutions rather than be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">problems that was my</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.359" end="01:05:35.359" style="s2">framing back then um by john todd and</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">all those people</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.359" end="01:05:42.160" style="s2">yes um and now i fee</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">feel like i&#39;ve spent 10 years um here on</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.160" end="01:05:45.280" style="s2">majorca</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">where i moved because i realized after</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.280" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">years with the ecovillage movement the</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">transition town movement again still</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">kind of activist community focused small</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:57.440" style="s2">scale small is beautiful very</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">schumacher influenced and working</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.440" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">on these alternative models and</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">realizing that they they&#39;re not at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:04.559" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">where the whole system&#39;s design is</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.559" end="01:06:10.240" style="s2">actually possible to really be truly</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">regenerating value flows</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.240" end="01:06:14.640" style="s2">both ecological and others and and and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:17.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s where i i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">come to realize that to refit our</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:21.200" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:22.799" style="s2">to natural patterns to my mind is at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.200" end="01:06:24.720" style="s2">bioregional scale</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.799" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">and and that&#39;s why i moved to mallorca</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.720" end="01:06:30.480" style="s2">because um</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">islands are very excellent um</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.480" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">case studies for bioregional change</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:35.119" style="s2">because the one problem you run into</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:37.599" style="s2">when you try to do a</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.119" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">sort of thames watershed by a regional</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.599" end="01:06:40.000" style="s2">thing is that it&#39;s too easy to just</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.200" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">extend the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">border into the next watershed if if</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:45.760" style="s2">something um</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:46.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t available just put a pipe across</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.760" end="01:06:49.760" style="s2">the hill</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.720" end="01:06:54.799" style="s2">exactly and and so so</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.760" end="01:06:54.799" style="s2">uh i personally now feel a real need to</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.520" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">draw back from the advocacy that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">been doing the last four years since my</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:07.200" style="s2">um has come out and round</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.000" end="01:07:08.720" style="s2">my advocacy back into the work</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.200" end="01:07:10.640" style="s2">that i&#39;ve also done for ten years which</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.720" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">is to pull back and nurture</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.640" end="01:07:15.680" style="s2">pull together and nurture here on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">island a an ecosystem of collaborators</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.680" end="01:07:19.920" style="s2">and and projects</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">um that that have sprung up some with</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.920" end="01:07:23.920" style="s2">a little bit of my contribution others</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">independently but bringing them together</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.920" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">and making people see that there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">actually already the beginnings of a um</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">bi-regional regeneration project</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">happening here and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">am i&#39;m also working with a friend on a</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">proposal</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:42.640" style="s2">to plant a million trees on majorca but</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:44.640" style="s2">not in big plantations but to actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.640" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">start a whole new agricultural</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.640" end="01:07:52.240" style="s2">and biomaterials research base that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:54.559" style="s2">that would benefit all people who live</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.240" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">in any of the four mediterranean climate</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.559" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">zones so entire the entire mediterranean</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">rim but also california and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">south africa and um and australia</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:09.119" style="s2">to do the research what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">very diverse highly productive</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.119" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">local and regional scale planting</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:16.880" style="s2">systems we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">develop that also look at climate change</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.880" end="01:08:20.159" style="s2">coming because</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:21.600" style="s2">like on majorca we have the opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:23.120" style="s2">because we have the four main</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.600" end="01:08:24.640" style="s2">mediterranean climate zones</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.120" end="01:08:26.480" style="s2">represented on the island because we</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.640" end="01:08:28.799" style="s2">have mountains and we have</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.480" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">yeah um different rainfall patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.799" end="01:08:32.960" style="s2">different parts of the island</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.319" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">and and so what what i really want to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.960" end="01:08:35.600" style="s2">is to</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.120" style="s2">pull back a little bit from the global</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.600" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.120" end="01:08:43.600" style="s2">a build my own family resilience</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">um stronger and move into into a</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.600" end="01:08:46.719" style="s2">a home that that actually has a bit of</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.840" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">at the moment because i i see people</p>

<p begin="01:10:18.000" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">um which is important but we need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:24.560" style="s2">find the balance and i want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:26.080" style="s2">try to model that by rebalancing my own</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.560" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.080" end="01:10:30.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a wonderful answer and it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:33.199" style="s2">me reflect</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.080" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">you know i if i had a you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.199" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">a a similar blank slate and i&#39;d i i</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">think i</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">it would probably go a different</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:42.800" style="s2">direction from you in the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">i love the local uh i you know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.800" end="01:10:46.159" style="s2">lived in</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:47.199" style="s2">this particular house since 1975 and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.159" end="01:10:49.760" style="s2">know a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.199" end="01:10:51.360" style="s2">lovely community quite a lot of wildlife</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.760" end="01:10:54.480" style="s2">around the thames very close</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.360" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">uh by and so on but i think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.480" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">work that i do</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:59.040" style="s2">has been global i mean or at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:01.440" style="s2">been on a global stage</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.040" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">and and in a way my sort of job title</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.440" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">which was sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:06.400" style="s2">given to me rather than ceased by me</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">which is chief pollinator</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.400" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">and that ability to link different</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:11.920" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">um that are going in the right direction</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.920" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">around the world i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">will remain uh quite important uh for</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:20.880" style="s2">the work that um</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:21.760" style="s2">i do but just on the local level uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.880" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">actually links</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.760" end="01:11:26.000" style="s2">um i mentioned i think that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:28.159" style="s2">when i was a child in northern ireland</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.000" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">i had this experience with thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:32.080" style="s2">eels and</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:33.600" style="s2">since that time the population of</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.080" end="01:11:35.760" style="s2">european eels has gone down</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.600" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">over 95 percent and the same in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.760" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">united states and the same in</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:41.360" style="s2">uh places like japan and this is a you</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:41.679" style="s2">know i don&#39;t particularly love eels but</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.360" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.679" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">but there are foundational species for</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">so many other</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:49.120" style="s2">uh things that that that have depended</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:52.320" style="s2">on them and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.120" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">i don&#39;t a few years back um</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">through an organization called the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">sustainable eels group</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">i was involved in releasing 30 000</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">elders into the river</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:03.040" style="s2">seven and it was i was probably the most</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.320" end="01:12:05.040" style="s2">magical</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.040" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">moment apart from seeing our daughter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.040" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">born or whatever it was actually it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:11.760" style="s2">like giving birth in a weird way because</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">you know you were giving something to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.760" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:14.880" style="s2">wider world and one of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">extraordinary things that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.880" end="01:12:17.600" style="s2">since then</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:19.199" style="s2">at that point the the curve was just</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.600" end="01:12:21.600" style="s2">coming down and down and down and</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.199" end="01:12:23.440" style="s2">just in the last 18 months it started to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.600" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">come bend</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.440" end="01:12:27.760" style="s2">backwards now that&#39;s heavy rainfall over</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">the winter and various other things as</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.760" end="01:12:32.560" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">but i it was the first very personal</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.560" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">demonstration that i&#39;d had of that on</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">the bigger scale</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">sort of eel populations going from for</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.480" end="01:12:41.199" style="s2">example europe to the sargasso sea and</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:43.679" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.199" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">um that you can have an influence well</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.679" end="01:12:46.159" style="s2">we have a malign influence historically</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.159" end="01:12:50.239" style="s2">you can actually start to bring uh that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">back but the implications of that is you</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.239" end="01:12:52.480" style="s2">start to have to take apart dams you</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:55.520" style="s2">have to talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.480" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">a lot of the barriers to these um</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">organisms as they migrate and so on</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">and just finally i um</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">we recently launched a sort of an award</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">scheme there&#39;s only three people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:08.640" style="s2">got it so far and it&#39;s called the green</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:10.640" style="s2">swan</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.640" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">award and and the second person to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.640" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">it was sasha bench</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:18.320" style="s2">and what she&#39;s done is to use a um</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">a paramotor to fly seven thousand</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.320" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">kilometers i think it was from siberia</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">to the uk alongside buick swans</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">to just to dramatize to inform</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:31.360" style="s2">people uh that these things with</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:33.520" style="s2">migratory</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.360" end="01:13:35.520" style="s2">uh roots are and that was over i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.520" end="01:13:37.280" style="s2">across 11 countries</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.520" end="01:13:38.719" style="s2">and along the way hunters were shooting</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.280" end="01:13:40.640" style="s2">at them and all sorts of things were</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.719" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">happening with their habitats and so on</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.640" end="01:13:44.239" style="s2">and i love these people who are trying</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.239" end="01:13:47.360" style="s2">underscore spotlight dramatize the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">things that are going wrong</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.360" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">and at the same time starting to signal</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:54.080" style="s2">what we might do</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">uh differently so um i mean i was born</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.080" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">an optimist but but at times that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.880" style="s2">actually rather</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:03.040" style="s2">uh strained yeah no i i think that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.880" end="01:14:04.800" style="s2">uh einstein again was probably quite</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.040" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">good by saying i&#39;m i&#39;m a pessimist for</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.800" end="01:14:08.640" style="s2">the 21st sec</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:10.400" style="s2">century about an optimist for the 22nd</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.640" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">and so it really depends</p>
