<p begin="00:02:06.750" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">bring this up is this is something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.039" end="00:02:16.110" style="s2">been working on myself and being in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:19.350" style="s2">culture and society where so much value</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.110" end="00:02:22.739" style="s2">is putting on what we do and even when</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.350" end="00:02:25.590" style="s2">I&#39;m asked or we ask children what do you</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.739" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">want to be when you grow up they the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.590" end="00:02:30.750" style="s2">answer ends up being a doing answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:32.430" style="s2">versus a being answer even though the</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.750" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">question is being and so we get this</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.430" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">association you know what do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">be when you grow up it&#39;s like oh I want</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:43.230" style="s2">to be and then they name the job which</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">is interesting something that&#39;s come to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.230" end="00:02:48.930" style="s2">my attention recently I watch kids only</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">be a firefighter or an astronaut that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.930" end="00:02:54.420" style="s2">seems like a very doing thing would you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">agree that that&#39;s that&#39;s just how our</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.420" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">culture has been molding us up to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:04.260" style="s2">point oh yeah and it goes deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:06.570" style="s2">that not only is it a doing thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.260" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">one very specific specialist role and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.570" end="00:03:10.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a specialist role that is usually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">related to how they&#39;re gonna make money</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.170" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">and so it&#39;s what do you want to be when</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">you grow up first it takes them out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:21.870" style="s2">the moment into the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:24.060" style="s2">it takes them into wanting to develop</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.870" end="00:03:27.630" style="s2">who they are right in the framing of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.060" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">their essence as a job so you can look</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.630" end="00:03:32.130" style="s2">at how that is the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.500" style="s2">macroeconomics forming people to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.130" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">effective cogs in that system there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.500" end="00:03:38.630" style="s2">whole bunch of things going on right</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.019" end="00:03:42.209" style="s2">being in doing is definitely one of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.630" end="00:03:46.099" style="s2">as you&#39;re as you&#39;re exploring that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.209" end="00:03:48.209" style="s2">inquiry yourself if we reframe it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.099" end="00:03:50.520" style="s2">something like who do you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.209" end="00:03:52.790" style="s2">rather than what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.520" end="00:03:55.110" style="s2">here what do you want to do what the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.790" end="00:03:59.910" style="s2">what comes up for you as meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.110" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">answers to that I want to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.910" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">trustworthy want to be a community be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:10.290" style="s2">asset to the community and and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:13.530" style="s2">things like that things more along the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.290" end="00:04:16.140" style="s2">lines of characters or not characters</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.530" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">but yeah what what uh what&#39;s the value</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.140" end="00:04:23.490" style="s2">of my character am i I somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:28.770" style="s2">tells the truth things like that and how</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.490" end="00:04:30.270" style="s2">does it relate for you to what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:32.730" style="s2">character is doing what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.270" end="00:04:36.150" style="s2">relationship those qualities of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.730" end="00:04:39.470" style="s2">and doing it&#39;s some but it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.150" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">can do it&#39;s something I can be right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.470" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not uh it&#39;s not even it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:49.470" style="s2">that aspire to as it as choice you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">I can just I want people to trust me</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.470" end="00:04:53.990" style="s2">then I know that I need to behave with</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:53.990" style="s2">integrity</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.949" end="00:05:03.379" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of embedded dialectics</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.199" end="00:05:05.720" style="s2">or dichotomies here there&#39;s now versus</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.379" end="00:05:07.789" style="s2">later so you said this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.720" end="00:05:10.460" style="s2">can be now versus something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.789" end="00:05:12.770" style="s2">aspirational in the future and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.460" end="00:05:14.750" style="s2">something that is more around qualities</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.770" end="00:05:17.180" style="s2">of character versus specific types of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.750" end="00:05:20.889" style="s2">action someone can show up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.180" end="00:05:24.710" style="s2">integrity as a artist or as an inventor</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.889" end="00:05:26.990" style="s2">or as a entrepreneur or as a mother</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.710" end="00:05:29.000" style="s2">right lots of different roles and those</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.990" end="00:05:31.699" style="s2">roles are meaningful they are deep and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.000" end="00:05:33.800" style="s2">meaningful to who that unique being and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.699" end="00:05:38.810" style="s2">their expression and their Dharma and</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.800" end="00:05:40.039" style="s2">their purposes and then there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.810" end="00:05:42.620" style="s2">difference between the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.039" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">character of how other people feel in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.620" end="00:05:46.330" style="s2">relationship with them and their own</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.449" end="00:05:49.370" style="s2">quality of experience how they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.330" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">experienced life yeah and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.370" end="00:05:54.440" style="s2">look at the fact that we have choice</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:55.940" style="s2">over our own experience and we also have</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.440" end="00:05:57.979" style="s2">choice over how we affect the experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.940" end="00:05:59.870" style="s2">of others right all of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.979" end="00:06:01.909" style="s2">shows up here so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.870" end="00:06:04.599" style="s2">around optimizing the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.909" end="00:06:07.099" style="s2">between all these dialectics our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.599" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">acting in ways that optimize our own</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.099" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">experience and the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:13.400" style="s2">everyone and everything that we touch in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:15.680" style="s2">effect showing up right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.400" end="00:06:19.130" style="s2">fullest way we can now and in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">optimizes our growth trajectory into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.130" end="00:06:25.159" style="s2">future and qualities of being and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:27.259" style="s2">specific types of doing that are both</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.159" end="00:06:32.150" style="s2">aligned with each other and the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.259" end="00:06:33.590" style="s2">aspect of who we are yeah I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.150" end="00:06:39.860" style="s2">challenging sometimes to think about</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.590" end="00:06:41.240" style="s2">what it is that we do I find that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.860" end="00:06:44.750" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s a challenge between</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.240" end="00:06:46.490" style="s2">who we are or who we want to be and who</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.750" end="00:06:50.000" style="s2">were showing up how was showing up in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.490" end="00:06:52.279" style="s2">the world for others and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.000" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">conversations with others and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.279" end="00:06:59.029" style="s2">had this internal conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:07:04.820" style="s2">myself around am i showing up for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.029" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">purpose of am i doing this I tell myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.820" end="00:07:07.729" style="s2">and I&#39;ve watched other people tell</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:10.220" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re doing this because</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.729" end="00:07:12.980" style="s2">they love other people like</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.220" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">I&#39;m doing doing this out of love when in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.980" end="00:07:21.500" style="s2">reality it&#39;s the motivation is born out</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:23.060" style="s2">of out of need in that if I am NOT this</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.500" end="00:07:25.940" style="s2">way or I don&#39;t behave this way or I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:28.820" style="s2">don&#39;t do these things then this person</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.940" end="00:07:32.390" style="s2">won&#39;t love and accept me and so we end</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.820" end="00:07:35.420" style="s2">up in this we end up in this place where</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.390" end="00:07:37.370" style="s2">I either have to behave the way other</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.420" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">people want me to behave in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.370" end="00:07:43.330" style="s2">liked or I do whatever I want to do and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.580" end="00:07:49.070" style="s2">no one&#39;s gonna like me I can&#39;t do both</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.330" end="00:07:51.170" style="s2">that seems to be a reality that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:55.690" style="s2">created for a lot of people and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.170" end="00:07:55.690" style="s2">reality I&#39;ve had to wrestle with myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.370" end="00:08:01.700" style="s2">so we have more things where you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.290" end="00:08:03.700" style="s2">two different things that are both</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.700" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">meaningful framed as being dichotomous</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.700" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">right so you have your individuality and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.850" end="00:08:13.790" style="s2">your authenticity and your sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:17.150" style="s2">on one side which is who do I really</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.790" end="00:08:19.640" style="s2">just want to be for myself and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.150" end="00:08:22.810" style="s2">prima facie meaningful right obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.640" end="00:08:27.100" style="s2">meaningful and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.810" end="00:08:30.200" style="s2">relationship connection communion side</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.100" end="00:08:32.990" style="s2">which is how do I show up in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.200" end="00:08:34.250" style="s2">is enriching to other people so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.990" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2">they also want to show up with me</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.250" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">because this so much of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:39.860" style="s2">meaningful that only expresses itself</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:43.910" style="s2">interpersonally which is obviously also</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.860" end="00:08:47.330" style="s2">meaningful if we believe that there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.910" end="00:08:50.180" style="s2">an inexorable that cauda me between</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.330" end="00:08:51.920" style="s2">those where we have to sacrifice who we</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:53.560" style="s2">actually are for a relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.920" end="00:08:57.550" style="s2">sacrifice relationship to be who we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.560" end="00:08:57.550" style="s2">then life will suck and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.380" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not actually true it is true that</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.140" end="00:09:04.590" style="s2">those are poles but they&#39;re poles that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:07.230" style="s2">are actually complementary and when</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.590" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">navigated properly are symbiotic with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.230" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">each other that you being who you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:13.770" style="s2">actually are and you relating with other</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">people in the way that creates most</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.770" end="00:09:17.400" style="s2">meaningful relationship are symbiotic</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:18.690" style="s2">now you might be in a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.400" end="00:09:19.860" style="s2">someone where they want you to behave a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.690" end="00:09:21.270" style="s2">certain way because you kind of made</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.860" end="00:09:22.770" style="s2">that contract with them where from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.270" end="00:09:24.030" style="s2">beginning you acted a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.770" end="00:09:25.620" style="s2">thought that they wanted that was never</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.030" end="00:09:27.240" style="s2">true to who you were to get something</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.620" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">from them where the whole thing is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.240" end="00:09:30.660" style="s2"> commodities exchange but that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:32.730" style="s2">just might be an unauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.660" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">relationship to begin with would you say</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.730" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">that a lot of people have that</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:38.820" style="s2">relationship with their parents</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">sure defect though most people have that</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.820" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">relationship with their parents if their</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:44.610" style="s2">parents weren&#39;t really focused on</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:47.340" style="s2">facilitating those people being who they</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.610" end="00:09:50.760" style="s2">actually authentically were which is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.340" end="00:09:53.340" style="s2">most parents right and so then they are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.760" end="00:09:59.010" style="s2">being who they think their parents need</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.340" end="00:10:02.450" style="s2">them to be and this is why they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.010" end="00:10:06.570" style="s2">like going home for the holidays right</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.450" end="00:10:07.800" style="s2">now there&#39;s then one can rebel and say</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.570" end="00:10:12.960" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be whoever the I want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.800" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">be and lose connection or they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.960" end="00:10:16.500" style="s2">sacrifice who they are and their</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:18.030" style="s2">authenticity in a codependent way for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:21.720" style="s2">connection that isn&#39;t real connection at</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.030" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">pseudo connection or they can see what</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.720" end="00:10:25.500" style="s2">is the authentic overlap between who my</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:27.270" style="s2">parents actually are who I actually am</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.500" end="00:10:29.880" style="s2">what is the what is the overlap of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.270" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">Venn diagram that&#39;s authentic and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.880" end="00:10:35.850" style="s2">see how we can explore that let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:38.370" style="s2">how we can expand it yeah what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:41.550" style="s2">would you say to somebody who say grew</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.370" end="00:10:43.800" style="s2">up and I was just talking someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.550" end="00:10:47.550" style="s2">earlier today who grew up in the Mormon</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.800" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">religion and then they leave that</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.550" end="00:10:51.480" style="s2">religion and when we look at that Venn</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:54.600" style="s2">diagram there&#39;s really not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.480" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">overlap or maybe there is overlap but</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.600" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult to find how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.980" end="00:11:05.130" style="s2">you go how do you go about do we do we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">need to reconcile those relationships is</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.130" end="00:11:11.699" style="s2">that something that we owe other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:15.869" style="s2">so we talked about being I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.699" end="00:11:18.209" style="s2">environment I think you do to where the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.869" end="00:11:21.269" style="s2">new the relationships that are new are</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.209" end="00:11:23.249" style="s2">easy to get into because we&#39;re showing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.269" end="00:11:25.730" style="s2">up as our most authentic selves more</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.249" end="00:11:27.989" style="s2">than we ever have before and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.730" end="00:11:28.639" style="s2">you start the relationship without the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.989" end="00:11:32.639" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:28.639" end="00:11:35.730" style="s2">but a relationship that where you grew</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.639" end="00:11:37.769" style="s2">up with it and now is it something worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.730" end="00:11:40.980" style="s2">cutting away later on in life and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.769" end="00:11:44.059" style="s2">cutting people out or is it something do</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.980" end="00:11:44.059" style="s2">we ople something</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:52.490" style="s2">I think there&#39;s another way to ask if</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:57.050" style="s2">that&#39;s more insightful it&#39;s not do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.490" end="00:12:00.050" style="s2">owe our parents in obligatory false</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.050" end="00:12:02.720" style="s2">relationship which is not actually very</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.050" end="00:12:06.649" style="s2">meaningful for anyone or on the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.720" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">side do we just cut it out I think one</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.649" end="00:12:12.500" style="s2">meaningful question is as we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:15.769" style="s2">interacting with our parents can we feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:18.529" style="s2">comfortable being who we are hmm without</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.769" end="00:12:20.180" style="s2">needing their approval and without</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.529" end="00:12:22.250" style="s2">needing them to understand us and agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.180" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">with us and can we let them be who they</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.250" end="00:12:29.269" style="s2">are and even if they can&#39;t even if they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:30.620" style="s2">don&#39;t have a worldview maybe they think</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.269" end="00:12:33.889" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna burn in hell or they think</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.620" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">whatever it is right can we accept them</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.889" end="00:12:38.149" style="s2">get them where they&#39;re at and be who we</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:39.649" style="s2">are or do we go into some trigger where</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.149" end="00:12:41.180" style="s2">we think we need to change who we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.649" end="00:12:43.459" style="s2">for them or we need to change who they</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.180" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">are and to the degree that that trigger</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.459" end="00:12:48.050" style="s2">arises is there an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:50.319" style="s2">opportunity for us to heal that and are</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.050" end="00:12:53.620" style="s2">they a really good mirror for showing us</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.319" end="00:12:55.970" style="s2">where those triggers live inside of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.620" end="00:12:58.730" style="s2">I&#39;ve been that conversation with people</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.970" end="00:13:00.230" style="s2">before too is like you think you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.730" end="00:13:01.940" style="s2">think you&#39;re enlightened or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.230" end="00:13:05.000" style="s2">want to call it let&#39;s go hang out your</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.940" end="00:13:07.399" style="s2">family and they&#39;ll show you it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.000" end="00:13:09.529" style="s2">classic statement that yeah if people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.399" end="00:13:14.630" style="s2">are focused on some kind of personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.529" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">development one good measure is if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.630" end="00:13:19.100" style="s2">hang out with your parents the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:21.620" style="s2">which you can be authentically you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.100" end="00:13:23.209" style="s2">at peace around them without trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.620" end="00:13:24.769" style="s2">convince them of anything and let them</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.209" end="00:13:27.019" style="s2">be who they are without being triggered</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.769" end="00:13:29.540" style="s2">on who they are is a good measure for</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.019" end="00:13:32.449" style="s2">how you&#39;ve come yeah that&#39;s powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.540" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">because they pretty much installed the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.449" end="00:13:37.699" style="s2">triggers yes so this is why it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:40.420" style="s2">deep mirror for the triggers you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.699" end="00:13:43.399" style="s2">they are for you yeah which is why you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.420" end="00:13:44.630" style="s2">disproportionately react to them in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.399" end="00:13:46.279" style="s2">way that nobody else does right other</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.630" end="00:13:48.019" style="s2">people won&#39;t see them like whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.279" end="00:13:49.399" style="s2">it&#39;s irritating it&#39;s cute it&#39;s no big</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.019" end="00:13:52.730" style="s2">deal and you&#39;re freaking out about it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.399" end="00:13:55.040" style="s2">because all of your trauma you know has</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.730" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">history there and to the degree you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.040" end="00:13:58.579" style="s2">healed your trauma it&#39;s not so getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:00.170" style="s2">pushed yeah and to the degree you</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.579" end="00:14:00.710" style="s2">haven&#39;t seeing it shows you where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.170" end="00:14:05.330" style="s2">gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.710" end="00:14:07.070" style="s2">yeah so coming back to I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.330" end="00:14:09.830" style="s2">dive in just the definition of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.070" end="00:14:16.640" style="s2">which is we talked about states of being</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.830" end="00:14:19.580" style="s2">and and I personally been looking at you</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.640" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">know doing versus being and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.580" end="00:14:24.440" style="s2">think a lot of us in the Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:27.380" style="s2">consider we go oh if I do these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.440" end="00:14:30.110" style="s2">then I&#39;ll be this person and then we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.380" end="00:14:33.020" style="s2">those things and then we and we gonna</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.110" end="00:14:34.790" style="s2">become a piece of this person we thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.020" end="00:14:37.670" style="s2">we would become once we do these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.790" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">and now we have to do more things in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.670" end="00:14:45.020" style="s2">order to feel good and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:46.490" style="s2">investigating the possibility of going</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.020" end="00:14:49.339" style="s2">straight to being and then once you</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.490" end="00:14:51.529" style="s2">become the person that you want to be or</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.339" end="00:14:53.300" style="s2">the person you were you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.529" end="00:14:58.010" style="s2">person you were before you were</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.300" end="00:15:00.529" style="s2">imprinted you become this person that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.010" end="00:15:03.140" style="s2">has that is this being and this being</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.529" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">just does the things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.140" end="00:15:11.150" style="s2">supposed to do or it just unfolds easily</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:13.100" style="s2">so a lot of my focus has been around how</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.150" end="00:15:15.500" style="s2">can I be different without focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.100" end="00:15:19.640" style="s2">the doing first and then coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.500" end="00:15:22.010" style="s2">lifetime of being taught that you do to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:25.610" style="s2">become and now I&#39;m going in Reverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.010" end="00:15:29.900" style="s2">going okay I want to be different and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.610" end="00:15:33.860" style="s2">need to go and and can the motivation</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.900" end="00:15:35.779" style="s2">and is the motivation pure it&#39;s like do</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.860" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">I want to be so that I can do and in</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.779" end="00:15:39.500" style="s2">which case is that even possible or do</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:42.050" style="s2">it do I need to have the pure motivation</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.500" end="00:15:44.690" style="s2">of look I want to be for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.050" end="00:15:47.550" style="s2">being and being authentic and then I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.690" end="00:15:49.140" style="s2">need to trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.550" end="00:15:53.720" style="s2">trust them the uncertainty of what that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.140" end="00:15:55.950" style="s2">looks like when the doing happens mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.720" end="00:15:58.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of elements kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.950" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">wrapped up in there let&#39;s let&#39;s pull</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.050" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">them apart and see if we can address</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:09.839" style="s2">them I&#39;d actually like to address the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">topic of dichotomy and paradox a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.839" end="00:16:14.100" style="s2">bit more essentially because it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:15.660" style="s2">at the heart here of is being really</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.100" end="00:16:18.839" style="s2">what we care about we actually care</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.660" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">about who we are character-wise or we</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.839" end="00:16:24.029" style="s2">care about our state of experience right</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:26.130" style="s2">and all the doing is really just so we</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.029" end="00:16:27.810" style="s2">can be happy or good or something and if</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.130" end="00:16:29.399" style="s2">we&#39;re there already then how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.810" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">any idea what we would do and who cares</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.399" end="00:16:32.940" style="s2">and does it matter or is doing really</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:34.740" style="s2">relevant because we&#39;re actually evolving</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.940" end="00:16:36.690" style="s2">the world and we have a role to play and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.740" end="00:16:39.720" style="s2">what is the relationship between those</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.690" end="00:16:41.700" style="s2">and is there causal influence both ways</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.720" end="00:16:48.329" style="s2">does doing affect being and being effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.700" end="00:16:50.820" style="s2">doing and can they be recursive and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.329" end="00:16:54.750" style="s2">think about this very simple analogy but</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.820" end="00:16:57.870" style="s2">the analogies illustrative to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.750" end="00:16:59.520" style="s2">about a cylinder a cylinder is a three</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.870" end="00:17:00.870" style="s2">dimensional object it&#39;s a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.520" end="00:17:02.459" style="s2">three dimensional object we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.870" end="00:17:04.470" style="s2">thinking in three dimensions three</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.459" end="00:17:06.720" style="s2">spatial dimensions so it&#39;s an easy thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.470" end="00:17:08.459" style="s2">to think about but if you imagine a two</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.720" end="00:17:11.640" style="s2">dimensional creature right a plane on</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.459" end="00:17:14.040" style="s2">plane or creature they can&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.640" end="00:17:16.530" style="s2">cylinder they can see a two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.040" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">slice of it now there&#39;s an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.530" end="00:17:19.559" style="s2">number of two-dimensional slices since</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:21.900" style="s2">they&#39;re infinitely thin that stack on</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.559" end="00:17:23.880" style="s2">top of each other to actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.900" end="00:17:25.500" style="s2">thing up so they&#39;re actually reducing</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.880" end="00:17:28.020" style="s2">the total information of what that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.500" end="00:17:30.840" style="s2">infinitely right one dimension reduction</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.020" end="00:17:33.000" style="s2">is infinite right reduction so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.840" end="00:17:35.820" style="s2">slice the cylinder one way and they get</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.000" end="00:17:38.070" style="s2">a circle and it&#39;s very clear that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.820" end="00:17:40.200" style="s2">reality they&#39;re seeing it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.070" end="00:17:42.450" style="s2">passing through their space as a circle</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.200" end="00:17:44.640" style="s2">if it passed through perpendicular to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.450" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">that they&#39;d get a rectangle right the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.640" end="00:17:49.830" style="s2">other and a cross-section from a</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:54.260" style="s2">two-dimensional perspective like is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.830" end="00:17:56.900" style="s2">cylinder a rectangle a circle well</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.260" end="00:17:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously whichever one is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.900" end="00:18:00.470" style="s2">happening like it being a circle is true</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.850" end="00:18:02.690" style="s2">it&#39;s very clear that from a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.470" end="00:18:05.570" style="s2">two-dimensional perspective like that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.690" end="00:18:08.330" style="s2">what is being seen it&#39;s true if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.570" end="00:18:09.650" style="s2">the perfect fidelity to it right from</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.330" end="00:18:12.070" style="s2">the other direction as a rectangle it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:14.210" style="s2">also perfectly true and those two</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.070" end="00:18:17.300" style="s2">descriptions of reality in two</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.210" end="00:18:19.630" style="s2">dimensions cannot commensurate right</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.300" end="00:18:22.010" style="s2">they are disparate mutually exclusive</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.630" end="00:18:25.040" style="s2">descriptions of circles is totally round</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.010" end="00:18:27.350" style="s2">thing rectangles these corners and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.040" end="00:18:28.970" style="s2">then what are the opportunities well you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.350" end="00:18:30.470" style="s2">can either just say I saw a circle so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.970" end="00:18:32.600" style="s2">know it&#39;s circle and the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.470" end="00:18:34.730" style="s2">just wrong mm-hmm that&#39;s fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.600" end="00:18:36.440" style="s2">which is kind of like there&#39;s some truth</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.730" end="00:18:37.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m sticking to it right and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.440" end="00:18:40.280" style="s2">fight with the people on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.600" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">or you see the circle and then you for</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.280" end="00:18:42.920" style="s2">some how you happen to be on the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:44.390" style="s2">plane and see the rectangle too and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.920" end="00:18:48.020" style="s2">go there&#39;s seemingly truth to both</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.390" end="00:18:50.180" style="s2">of these now I have embraced paradox</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.020" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">what do I do with this and you have</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.180" end="00:18:54.020" style="s2">different options one way as you say</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:55.460" style="s2">well maybe there&#39;s a middle path but</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.020" end="00:18:56.780" style="s2">you&#39;re still trying to reconcile in two</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.460" end="00:18:58.010" style="s2">dimensions cuz you&#39;re two dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.780" end="00:19:00.260" style="s2">creature so you say well what&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.010" end="00:19:01.370" style="s2">in the middle of a circle and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.260" end="00:19:03.020" style="s2">rectangle and you get a rounded</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.370" end="00:19:04.190" style="s2">rectangle now you kind of round the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.020" end="00:19:05.900" style="s2">corners of the rectangle make it a</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.190" end="00:19:08.360" style="s2">little more circular like now that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.900" end="00:19:10.430" style="s2">even partially true right like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.360" end="00:19:12.230" style="s2">isn&#39;t even a little bit of any part of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.430" end="00:19:15.860" style="s2">cylinder or you just say well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.230" end="00:19:17.780" style="s2">both true and neither are true and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:19.910" style="s2">embrace paradox and that just means you</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.780" end="00:19:22.190" style="s2">gave up on understanding its really what</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.910" end="00:19:25.090" style="s2">it means the truth is a cylinder is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.190" end="00:19:29.320" style="s2">very straight forward thing which is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.090" end="00:19:31.610" style="s2">circle translated over the space of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.320" end="00:19:33.500" style="s2">rectangle or a rectangle rotated to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.610" end="00:19:34.760" style="s2">space of a circle but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.500" end="00:19:36.410" style="s2">understand it in duty you can only</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.760" end="00:19:38.750" style="s2">understand it in 3d which means you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.410" end="00:19:40.190" style="s2">an entirely higher dimensional framework</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.750" end="00:19:41.450" style="s2">of understanding to get the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.190" end="00:19:46.010" style="s2">reality when you&#39;re trying to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.450" end="00:19:47.960" style="s2">reality to a dimensionally smaller</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.010" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">perspective you&#39;re right because</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.960" end="00:19:51.530" style="s2">that dimension simply can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:54.140" style="s2">it so then you have false paradox</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.530" end="00:19:56.330" style="s2">because the the perspective the view</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.140" end="00:19:57.890" style="s2">itself is reducing the total reality and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.330" end="00:19:59.390" style="s2">you can even see just looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.890" end="00:20:00.590" style="s2">east side of a building versus the west</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.390" end="00:20:01.790" style="s2">side you could argue over what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.590" end="00:20:04.700" style="s2">building looks like and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.790" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">perception is inherently reductive you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.700" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">cannot see the whole of what something</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.260" end="00:20:10.130" style="s2">is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:11.770" style="s2">many many different views of it right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.130" end="00:20:15.040" style="s2">you need a trans perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.770" end="00:20:20.140" style="s2">understanding that can reconcile them so</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.040" end="00:20:23.150" style="s2">the the reality of the cylinder is</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.150" end="00:20:27.290" style="s2">both of those are partially true from</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.740" end="00:20:30.110" style="s2">that kind of perspective well when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.290" end="00:20:33.040" style="s2">come to many existential questions it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.110" end="00:20:36.770" style="s2">seem paradoxical or dichotomous like</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.040" end="00:20:39.470" style="s2">being and doing is what really matters</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.770" end="00:20:42.200" style="s2">my state of being in the moment or was</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.470" end="00:20:44.960" style="s2">is what matters my state of becoming and</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.200" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">that I&#39;m becoming more and more right</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.960" end="00:20:50.780" style="s2">being side says outside of time and am i</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.650" end="00:21:09.230" style="s2">self actualizing and realizing right</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.430" end="00:21:10.880" style="s2">circle rectangle these are both true but</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.230" end="00:21:12.290" style="s2">we&#39;re not just saying well it&#39;s both a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.880" end="00:21:13.910" style="s2">circle and a rectangle we have to put</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.290" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">those together and say how are they both</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.910" end="00:21:18.860" style="s2">true how do being and becoming reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:20.630" style="s2">in that way and they the key thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.860" end="00:21:22.670" style="s2">get and we can see all the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.630" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">dichotomies that come with this based on</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.670" end="00:21:28.310" style="s2">the being model it&#39;s well I&#39;m gonna love</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:30.020" style="s2">and accept myself exactly how I am I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.310" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">gonna love and accept others in reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.020" end="00:21:33.560" style="s2">exactly how it is I&#39;m gonna see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:34.850" style="s2">beauty and everything right now on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.560" end="00:21:36.620" style="s2">becoming side you&#39;re like well I want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.850" end="00:21:37.700" style="s2">make myself better I want to help make</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.620" end="00:21:39.650" style="s2">others better I want to make the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.700" end="00:21:40.940" style="s2">better right well which one is it do I</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.650" end="00:21:44.420" style="s2">want to love what is or do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.940" end="00:21:47.660" style="s2">make it better this is exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.420" end="00:21:54.020" style="s2">struggle I think I&#39;ve been having and</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.660" end="00:21:55.910" style="s2">that I go through phases where I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.020" end="00:21:57.110" style="s2">through accepting and then I&#39;m going I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.910" end="00:21:59.990" style="s2">going you know what I need to really</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.110" end="00:22:02.870" style="s2">step it up yeah and there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.990" end="00:22:06.800" style="s2">need to change and I want to I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.870" end="00:22:10.520" style="s2">see the progress and and see the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.800" end="00:22:12.710" style="s2">evolution and then I it&#39;s almost as if I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.520" end="00:22:17.330" style="s2">get caught up and pushing the ball</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.710" end="00:22:21.040" style="s2">forward and then I feel as though my</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.330" end="00:22:23.260" style="s2">state of being there&#39;s static</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.040" end="00:22:26.140" style="s2">line and then I have to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.260" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">accepting things just as they are and in</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.140" end="00:22:30.850" style="s2">that state of being so this is as</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:34.230" style="s2">fascinating to me is I&#39;ve been living</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.850" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">I&#39;ve been living a life where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.230" end="00:22:41.560" style="s2">switching between truths right because I</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:45.670" style="s2">can&#39;t reconcile the two so we can be in</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.560" end="00:22:48.580" style="s2">a place or we flip flop between truths</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.670" end="00:22:52.210" style="s2">that both are self evidently true and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.580" end="00:22:54.250" style="s2">yet see Mun reconcilable or we can</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.210" end="00:22:55.660" style="s2">reconcile and live them both more fully</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.250" end="00:22:57.160" style="s2">simultaneously but we have to go higher</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.660" end="00:22:58.900" style="s2">dimensional to do that we have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:23:00.490" style="s2">a place where they can really reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.900" end="00:23:03.340" style="s2">and that requires and higher-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.490" end="00:23:05.410" style="s2">here isn&#39;t spacial dimensions it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.340" end="00:23:09.070" style="s2">we understand the complexity of reality</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.410" end="00:23:10.900" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna get to I&#39;d like to add</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.070" end="00:23:12.790" style="s2">another element of a model because it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.900" end="00:23:14.440" style="s2">really help with this and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.790" end="00:23:21.010" style="s2">think might find interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.440" end="00:23:23.310" style="s2">I want to compare for a minute roughly</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.010" end="00:23:27.190" style="s2">generalized very oversimplified an</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:31.050" style="s2">Eastern model and a Western model of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.190" end="00:23:31.050" style="s2">nature of reality and meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.140" end="00:23:35.500" style="s2">spirituality obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.090" end="00:23:36.760" style="s2">oversimplified because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.500" end="00:23:38.290" style="s2">Eastern models and a lot of Western</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.760" end="00:23:39.700" style="s2">models and the delineation between them</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.290" end="00:23:42.550" style="s2">isn&#39;t clear at all but let&#39;s just take</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.700" end="00:23:45.220" style="s2">by Eastern I mean they kind of Vedantic</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.550" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">Buddhists the primary interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.220" end="00:23:50.050" style="s2">which are very being focused and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.890" end="00:23:54.340" style="s2">using these as a reference for for this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.050" end="00:23:56.260" style="s2">particular dichotomy here so you notice</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.340" end="00:23:58.300" style="s2">in most interpretations the Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.260" end="00:24:00.670" style="s2">tradition the focus is exclusively on</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.300" end="00:24:05.560" style="s2">being right not doing not becoming in</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.670" end="00:24:07.300" style="s2">fact any chop wood carry water doing is</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.560" end="00:24:08.650" style="s2">just because if that needs done do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.300" end="00:24:10.210" style="s2">but it&#39;s all about the quality of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.650" end="00:24:12.450" style="s2">while doing it it&#39;s the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.210" end="00:24:12.450" style="s2">matters</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.110" end="00:24:19.180" style="s2">the reason why or one of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.510" end="00:24:22.090" style="s2">that becomes insightful is the Buddhists</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.180" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">and the Hindu vedanta model of time is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.090" end="00:24:25.450" style="s2">circular model of time all right they</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:29.290" style="s2">have this system of time called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.450" end="00:24:31.660" style="s2">culpas or the egos where where the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.290" end="00:24:33.790" style="s2">and universe itself is believed to cycle</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.660" end="00:24:35.800" style="s2">cycle through birth and death so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.790" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">know if you if you think about it these</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.800" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">people watch nature very deeply and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:45.460" style="s2">saw seasons spring and fall and they saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:47.140" style="s2">empires rise and then fall they saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.460" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">people born and then die they saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.140" end="00:24:49.960" style="s2">relationships come together and come</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:51.640" style="s2">apart and they just saw everything</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.960" end="00:24:53.740" style="s2">cycling they watched the precession of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.640" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">the equinoxes they saw cycles within</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.740" end="00:24:59.650" style="s2">cycles days within months within years</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:02.230" style="s2">within Galactic cycles right so they saw</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.650" end="00:25:04.120" style="s2">it was all cycles and so because of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.230" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">if everything cycling and then then they</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.120" end="00:25:08.710" style="s2">extend that up to but this is just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:11.290" style="s2">intellectual extension everything in</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.710" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">universe is just cycles then nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.290" end="00:25:15.640" style="s2">actually going anywhere we&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">in circles there is no actual thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.640" end="00:25:19.300" style="s2">called progress it&#39;s just the wheel of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:22.510" style="s2">time right so they have this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.300" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">the wheel of time so so if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.510" end="00:25:25.990" style="s2">to push something forward you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:27.400" style="s2">moving to the cycle more quickly you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.990" end="00:25:28.540" style="s2">bought into the illusion that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.400" end="00:25:31.240" style="s2">going anywhere right</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.540" end="00:25:33.250" style="s2">that spring means anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.240" end="00:25:35.950" style="s2">its way towards fallen death right</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.250" end="00:25:38.380" style="s2">mm-hmm and so this is why then they talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.950" end="00:25:40.510" style="s2">they talk about it as Maya right</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.380" end="00:25:42.880" style="s2">illusion or even more some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.510" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">suffering so then if it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:48.700" style="s2"> loser e wheel it isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:50.800" style="s2">going anywhere going further is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.700" end="00:25:52.060" style="s2">meaningless so then there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.800" end="00:25:55.740" style="s2">movie samsara</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.060" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">on Netflix you can watch which is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.740" end="00:25:59.350" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:02.800" style="s2">it&#39;s demonstrating that if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.350" end="00:26:06.340" style="s2">go see it that concept to concept right</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.800" end="00:26:09.490" style="s2">and so then the goal there becomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:11.290" style="s2">getting off the wheel and so that means</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.490" end="00:26:13.540" style="s2">getting out of time in the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.290" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">linear time completely so then the goal</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.540" end="00:26:20.620" style="s2">is being able to access the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:23.410" style="s2">through the now and so the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.620" end="00:26:25.560" style="s2">becoming or of progress or making the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:27.910" style="s2">world better when the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.560" end="00:26:30.490" style="s2">illusory to begin with meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.910" end="00:26:31.780" style="s2">fundamentally to begin with just means</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.490" end="00:26:33.700" style="s2">you bought into the illusion you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.780" end="00:26:39.400" style="s2">get the ultimate truth so the goal there</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.700" end="00:26:41.410" style="s2">is is to step out of time to be now full</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:43.780" style="s2">complete in a way that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.410" end="00:26:47.020" style="s2">progress built in at all mm-hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.780" end="00:26:50.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of pure zenith of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.020" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">being model you notice that happiness in</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.260" end="00:26:55.750" style="s2">that model is a model of happiness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.320" end="00:26:57.700" style="s2">like contentment or serenity like</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.750" end="00:27:00.040" style="s2">fullness right now with what is right</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.700" end="00:27:01.960" style="s2">and in fact anything like passion or</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.040" end="00:27:03.970" style="s2">desire or excitement is called the cause</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.960" end="00:27:05.500" style="s2">of all suffering right because that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.970" end="00:27:07.300" style="s2">means that you believe something good is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.500" end="00:27:08.950" style="s2">in the future so you sacrifice being in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.300" end="00:27:10.900" style="s2">the moment for wanting something in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.950" end="00:27:12.490" style="s2">future and that just leads you to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.900" end="00:27:13.480" style="s2">getting all feverish and up and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.490" end="00:27:14.710" style="s2">then when you get it you weren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.480" end="00:27:16.570" style="s2">that happy and you want something else</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.710" end="00:27:18.100" style="s2">and then you&#39;re anxious of losing it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.570" end="00:27:19.870" style="s2">just don&#39;t desire anything don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.100" end="00:27:24.280" style="s2">passion or anything just be full and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.870" end="00:27:25.930" style="s2">content now all right this is also yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.280" end="00:27:28.750" style="s2">this is great because this is also</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.930" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been studying</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.750" end="00:27:35.860" style="s2">you know like how do I be and then how</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">do I and then also it&#39;s hard to not</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.860" end="00:27:44.370" style="s2">believe that my passion and my my drive</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.140" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">in my just my desires are for nothing</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.370" end="00:27:49.540" style="s2">well they in that model they are for</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:52.650" style="s2">nothing that isn&#39;t a losery and stupid</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.540" end="00:27:55.090" style="s2">right right they they are for plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.650" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">sound and fury leading to suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.090" end="00:28:02.620" style="s2">nothing and so that&#39;s that model but</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">that is circle right that it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.620" end="00:28:07.000" style="s2">true but it&#39;s so far from true that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">just actually infinitely off okay I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.000" end="00:28:10.180" style="s2">far from the whole truth it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:11.860" style="s2">dimensional reduction so then let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.180" end="00:28:15.040" style="s2">at the Western model so everyone think</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.860" end="00:28:17.080" style="s2">it sounds boring it can sound boring but</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.040" end="00:28:20.530" style="s2">of course then the idea of boring in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.080" end="00:28:22.120" style="s2">that model would be a mental trap and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.530" end="00:28:24.970" style="s2">that when you come into the fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.120" end="00:28:29.140" style="s2">being right now you can access and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.970" end="00:28:31.810" style="s2">is true a state of serenity that has a</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.140" end="00:28:33.700" style="s2">kind of blissfulness to it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.810" end="00:28:37.060" style="s2">need you to do anything and that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.700" end="00:28:39.340" style="s2">unperturbed well so be like no you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.060" end="00:28:41.660" style="s2">actually don&#39;t get what the fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.340" end="00:28:43.430" style="s2">being and you drop into it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.660" end="00:28:45.500" style="s2">right that is eternal and that&#39;s unfuck</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.430" end="00:28:48.520" style="s2">with Abel so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.500" end="00:28:51.860" style="s2">now the Western model of time kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.520" end="00:28:54.890" style="s2">originating Judaism we can say and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.860" end="00:28:58.030" style="s2">the Greeks and modern science and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.890" end="00:29:01.340" style="s2">know I&#39;ve told most of the world now</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.030" end="00:29:05.930" style="s2">because early Jews were very focused on</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.340" end="00:29:08.660" style="s2">history and noticing their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.930" end="00:29:11.900" style="s2">progression as a as a people new</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.660" end="00:29:14.690" style="s2">technology as it emerged and new law and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.900" end="00:29:16.190" style="s2">new ideas and etc they and they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.690" end="00:29:19.280" style="s2">recording that they were actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.190" end="00:29:20.870" style="s2">noticing net change over time and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.280" end="00:29:23.510" style="s2">new things were emerging that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.870" end="00:29:25.790" style="s2">exist before and so rather than focusing</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.510" end="00:29:27.170" style="s2">on the cycles and in nature and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.790" end="00:29:29.330" style="s2">everything as cyclic they were focused</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.170" end="00:29:31.640" style="s2">on the emergence of things humans were</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.330" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">creating that were additive and actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.640" end="00:29:35.720" style="s2">going somewhere and so they had a linear</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.080" end="00:29:38.780" style="s2">model of time so time was actually going</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.720" end="00:29:39.680" style="s2">somewhere and so that led to a dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.780" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">of progress</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.680" end="00:29:45.070" style="s2">and a focus on becoming more than being</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:48.320" style="s2">then that in that model there is their</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.070" end="00:29:51.680" style="s2">what I&#39;ve seen is there&#39;s a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.320" end="00:29:53.450" style="s2">and an end maybe or maybe not sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.680" end="00:29:58.670" style="s2">there is a beginning and an end and</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.450" end="00:30:00.890" style="s2">maybe the beginning is the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.670" end="00:30:03.590" style="s2">universe in genesis maybe the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.890" end="00:30:04.850" style="s2">is when you were born maybe the end is</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.590" end="00:30:08.540" style="s2">heaven right there&#39;s different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.850" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">theological x&#39; they can disagree about</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.540" end="00:30:12.020" style="s2">where the beginning and the end is they</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.220" end="00:30:13.940" style="s2">can even have a reincarnation model</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.020" end="00:30:15.650" style="s2">within it but that there isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.940" end="00:30:17.090" style="s2">progress along the whole thing right</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.650" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">because universe itself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.090" end="00:30:20.180" style="s2">going somewhere and so you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:23.750" style="s2">somewhere within it and you&#39;re adding to</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.180" end="00:30:25.910" style="s2">universe going somewhere well if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.750" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">if you think universe is actually going</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.910" end="00:30:30.770" style="s2">somewhere then adding to universe going</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.320" style="s2">somewhere is inherently meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.770" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">you being part of where it&#39;s going is</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.320" end="00:30:38.360" style="s2">inherently meaningful so then just being</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:41.300" style="s2">in the moment is not that interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.360" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">becoming evermore in a universe that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.300" end="00:30:46.130" style="s2">itself becoming evermore so developing</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:48.410" style="s2">oneself right in which case being just</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.130" end="00:30:50.450" style="s2">completely content in a way that has no</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.410" end="00:30:52.400" style="s2">Drive is is antithetical to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.450" end="00:30:54.780" style="s2">purposeful so you notice their</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.400" end="00:30:57.330" style="s2">definition of happiness has a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.780" end="00:31:00.660" style="s2">it sounds like passion and excitement</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.330" end="00:31:02.430" style="s2">right right and which way you were to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.660" end="00:31:05.190" style="s2">look at if you look at those cultures</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.430" end="00:31:08.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of singing dancing you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.190" end="00:31:10.680" style="s2">know even partying whereas you look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.370" end="00:31:16.560" style="s2">some of the more Eastern philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.680" end="00:31:18.870" style="s2">and it&#39;s things very quiet and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.560" end="00:31:21.150" style="s2">the traditions are that I that I that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.870" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">I&#39;m that I&#39;m imagining right now like a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.150" end="00:31:27.930" style="s2">tea ceremony yeah very just it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.990" end="00:31:32.730" style="s2">calm not a lot of excitement very bland</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.930" end="00:31:35.490" style="s2">or vanilla well you&#39;re giving a Western</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.730" end="00:31:37.890" style="s2">bias here so you&#39;re calling it boring</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.490" end="00:31:42.990" style="s2">and bland and vanilla sure they would</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.890" end="00:31:44.550" style="s2">say profoundly serene I&#39;m am i insulting</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.990" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">people that come from that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.550" end="00:31:49.560" style="s2">you think well probably but what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.060" style="s2">what&#39;s more interesting is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.560" end="00:31:52.350" style="s2">not getting it yet right because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.060" end="00:31:53.220" style="s2">haven&#39;t you haven&#39;t dropped into that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.350" end="00:31:54.810" style="s2">place of getting it but you probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.220" end="00:31:56.100" style="s2">have if you think about it you might</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.810" end="00:31:59.190" style="s2">have had moments where you&#39;re surfing</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.100" end="00:32:01.290" style="s2">and you stopped and everything kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.190" end="00:32:03.720" style="s2">stops and you just see sparkles on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.290" end="00:32:06.390" style="s2">water and thinking about what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.720" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">next stops and the moments full mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.390" end="00:32:14.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s more full in a certain quality</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:15.750" style="s2">than excitement about the future is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.640" end="00:32:19.260" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.750" end="00:32:22.530" style="s2">definitely had moments right staying</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.260" end="00:32:25.710" style="s2">there so the whole eastern process would</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.530" end="00:32:28.580" style="s2">be staying there right each moment being</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.710" end="00:32:31.310" style="s2">fully with that need the endless wave</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.580" end="00:32:33.720" style="s2">except it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.310" end="00:32:36.270" style="s2">independent of circumstance right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.720" end="00:32:38.190" style="s2">some you&#39;re in the eye of the storm no</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.270" end="00:32:41.490" style="s2">matter what&#39;s happening around you you</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.190" end="00:32:43.740" style="s2">keep your peace yeah a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.490" end="00:32:46.620" style="s2">enlightenment and that model is being</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.740" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">able to be fully with what is no matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.620" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">what is no matter what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:52.470" style="s2">because everything that&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:54.690" style="s2">in illusion right it&#39;s all just changing</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.470" end="00:32:57.540" style="s2">and flexing but the consciousness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.690" end="00:32:59.490" style="s2">witnessing it is ever-present and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.540" end="00:33:01.020" style="s2">identifying as that and that that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.490" end="00:33:02.130" style="s2">actually the fullness right that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.020" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">light is actually the light of</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.130" end="00:33:09.620" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:12.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what waking up means there now so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.620" end="00:33:13.700" style="s2">if one wanted to bias from that</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.080" end="00:33:15.110" style="s2">direction they could look at the other</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.700" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">thing with all the singing advancing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.110" end="00:33:21.470" style="s2">say look how feverish it is hmm look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:23.090" style="s2">how kind of immature and it&#39;s excitement</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.470" end="00:33:24.680" style="s2">when things go well and disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.090" end="00:33:26.030" style="s2">things don&#39;t go well look at how little</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.680" end="00:33:27.320" style="s2">sovereignty that people have where</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.030" end="00:33:28.970" style="s2">they&#39;re so affected by their environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.320" end="00:33:30.680" style="s2">and their circumstance look at how they</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.970" end="00:33:32.030" style="s2">rush around trying to change their</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.680" end="00:33:33.470" style="s2">circumstance to make themselves happy</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.030" end="00:33:34.970" style="s2">look at how attached they get to other</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.470" end="00:33:36.290" style="s2">people and how up they get when</p>

<p begin="00:33:36.290" end="00:33:40.760" style="s2">at how unhappy they are when they lose</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.260" end="00:33:42.380" style="s2">something look at how when they get what</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.760" end="00:33:43.400" style="s2">they want they&#39;re only happy for like 15</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.380" end="00:33:45.920" style="s2">minutes and then they want something</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.400" end="00:33:49.430" style="s2">else and that there&#39;s like almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.920" end="00:33:52.880" style="s2">nothing of seeming enduring depth there</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.430" end="00:33:54.530" style="s2">right now these are both true right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.880" end="00:33:57.140" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about circles and</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.530" end="00:34:01.520" style="s2">rectangles so to just finish a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.140" end="00:34:03.500" style="s2">bit on the on the Western model so time</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.520" end="00:34:05.420" style="s2">is going somewhere dialectic of progress</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.500" end="00:34:07.460" style="s2">so the focus becomes purpose because</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.420" end="00:34:12.230" style="s2">purpose is a time bound concept purpose</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.460" end="00:34:16.070" style="s2">unfolds in time right and evolution is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.230" end="00:34:17.990" style="s2">time bound concept and so evolving</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.070" end="00:34:19.820" style="s2">ourselves evolving others evolving the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.990" end="00:34:21.980" style="s2">world around us becoming more being able</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.820" end="00:34:23.810" style="s2">to express more of infinite potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.980" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">through the finite through time work and</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.810" end="00:34:28.970" style="s2">and in there in that model it would say</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:31.010" style="s2">well of course when you get what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.970" end="00:34:32.510" style="s2">wanted you aren&#39;t just enduring ly happy</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.010" end="00:34:35.179" style="s2">because then you would stop becoming the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.510" end="00:34:36.620" style="s2">goal is to be becoming forever the goal</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.179" end="00:34:39.650" style="s2">is actually to be in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.620" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">blossoming at the depth what universe is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.650" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">the evolutionary impulse that brings</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:46.040" style="s2">subatomic particles together into</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:47.900" style="s2">particles and particles into you know</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.900" end="00:34:51.919" style="s2">whole thing from the Big Bang on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.370" end="00:34:55.360" style="s2">that that what keeps organizing universe</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.919" end="00:34:58.430" style="s2">towards more orderly complexity is a</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.430" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">into higher order potential of universe</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.290" end="00:35:05.540" style="s2">and that you resulted from that and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">also have the ability to choose in a way</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.540" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">that aligns yourself with that and so of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:11.120" style="s2">course when you get something then</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:12.410" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re happy for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.120" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">because you&#39;re in the becoming but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.410" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">actually the being in the becoming</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:16.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:20.100" style="s2">right what tear</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.920" end="00:35:21.780" style="s2">Chardin called the lore of becoming but</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.100" end="00:35:27.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s about becoming and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.780" end="00:35:33.470" style="s2">also ever every moment right and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.800" end="00:35:36.240" style="s2">there it&#39;s more about excitement passion</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.470" end="00:35:38.040" style="s2">you know associated with becoming now</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.240" end="00:35:40.380" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting when you put these</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.040" end="00:35:42.810" style="s2">together you have a circular model of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.380" end="00:35:44.430" style="s2">time and a linear model corresponding</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.810" end="00:35:48.510" style="s2">with the circular is being with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.430" end="00:35:51.630" style="s2">linear is becoming with the circular as</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.510" end="00:35:54.330" style="s2">presence with the Lanier&#39;s purpose with</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.630" end="00:35:56.760" style="s2">the circular is contentment serenity in</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.330" end="00:35:59.460" style="s2">the fullness of the now and with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.760" end="00:36:02.190" style="s2">linear is passion and purpose and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.460" end="00:36:05.370" style="s2">promise of possibility you notice that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.190" end="00:36:07.230" style="s2">the circular model maps to the serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.370" end="00:36:11.850" style="s2">like happiness and the serotonergic</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.230" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">systems right and the linear model maps</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.850" end="00:36:18.480" style="s2">to dopamine right and the dopamine kinds</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:22.050" style="s2">of happiness like processing and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.480" end="00:36:25.470" style="s2">the practices are tying this to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.050" end="00:36:27.570" style="s2">there are transmitters this brings so</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.470" end="00:36:29.180" style="s2">much application and if anyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.570" end="00:36:32.040" style="s2">anything about how those things are</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.180" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2">impact or if you&#39;ve had experiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.040" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">where you had an excess and dopamine or</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:40.980" style="s2">serotonin right and it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:42.990" style="s2">why those experiences were it that way</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.980" end="00:36:45.180" style="s2">people have interesting people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.990" end="00:36:48.210" style="s2">explored it might resonate with thee</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.180" end="00:36:51.120" style="s2">they took a serotonin urja faint right</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.210" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">they took MDMA and they became very in</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.120" end="00:36:55.470" style="s2">the moment very sensory very feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:36:57.720" style="s2">very in the fullness of everything being</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.470" end="00:36:59.850" style="s2">overwhelmingly beautiful now yeah almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.720" end="00:37:02.010" style="s2">no awareness of other than now okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.850" end="00:37:04.110" style="s2">someone took dopaminergic thing right</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.010" end="00:37:06.750" style="s2">they took adderall or cocaine or</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.110" end="00:37:09.150" style="s2">whatever they become profoundly focused</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.750" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">on what they wanted to create and they</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.150" end="00:37:14.670" style="s2">all they wanted to do is be in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:16.980" style="s2">process of creating it right and we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.670" end="00:37:19.710" style="s2">see the beauty and the crashes of both</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.980" end="00:37:22.260" style="s2">of those and what becomes more available</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.710" end="00:37:23.940" style="s2">and less available in both of those we</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.260" end="00:37:26.130" style="s2">can see them the practices right a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.940" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">of the eastern practices are serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.130" end="00:37:30.510" style="s2">Erick practices being in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:33.420" style="s2">breathing slow being</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.510" end="00:37:36.180" style="s2">nature having all of your awareness your</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.420" end="00:37:39.740" style="s2">sensory awareness and what is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.180" end="00:37:42.330" style="s2">the Western practices are create goals</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.740" end="00:37:44.070" style="s2">achieve the goals feel good that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.330" end="00:37:45.990" style="s2">achieved them check them off reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.070" end="00:37:50.130" style="s2">having goals create more goals check ray</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.990" end="00:37:52.950" style="s2">and those are dopaminergic practices now</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.130" end="00:37:56.460" style="s2">if we come back to our 2d 3d technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.950" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">I mean dopamine is addiction yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.460" end="00:38:00.510" style="s2">dopamine dopamine and its relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.300" style="s2">with opioids the dopamine opioid system</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.510" end="00:38:05.220" style="s2">is feels good do it again</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.300" end="00:38:07.620" style="s2">because it is time-bound what things</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.220" end="00:38:08.490" style="s2">were evolutionarily relevant to do again</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.620" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.490" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">nobody said in terms of addicted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:13.830" style="s2">serotonin if you&#39;re having an experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:15.650" style="s2">that is more about being in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.830" end="00:38:19.860" style="s2">you&#39;re not jonesing for the next moment</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.650" end="00:38:22.620" style="s2">right that would explain why people tend</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.860" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">to get hooked on something like cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.620" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">and maybe MDMA is not as addictive right</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:31.710" style="s2">now someone might have a serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.540" style="s2">imbalance so they&#39;re gonna keep wanting</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.710" end="00:38:35.700" style="s2">to go back to some serotonin magic thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.540" end="00:38:39.900" style="s2">does all you see all SSRIs are focused</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.700" end="00:38:42.540" style="s2">on that but it is all addiction relates</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.900" end="00:38:44.640" style="s2">to the dopamine axis hmm other things</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.540" end="00:38:52.890" style="s2">are involved but it will always involve</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.640" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">that okay now come back to our 3d 2d</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.890" end="00:38:57.150" style="s2">analogy with the cylinder but let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:59.370" style="s2">at their models of time here and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.150" end="00:39:01.350" style="s2">circle and the the circular model of</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.370" end="00:39:03.570" style="s2">time linear model of time and if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.350" end="00:39:04.470" style="s2">embed those on each other in a higher</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.570" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">dimension because those are both</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.470" end="00:39:07.800" style="s2">one-dimensional right one dimension</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:10.380" style="s2">curved back on itself like a circle or</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.800" end="00:39:12.360" style="s2">one dimension you know if time that just</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.380" end="00:39:14.580" style="s2">continues straight if you bring them</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.360" end="00:39:16.140" style="s2">together you get a spiral of time right</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.580" end="00:39:18.060" style="s2">which is a circle that isn&#39;t closing on</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.140" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">itself it&#39;s a circle that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.060" end="00:39:23.180" style="s2">moving along a line so then you say are</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:26.130" style="s2">there cycles yes there are cycles and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.180" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">there is net change from one cycle to</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.130" end="00:39:32.070" style="s2">the next now why this is meaningful as</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:33.720" style="s2">we see we look at the ecosystem and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.070" end="00:39:34.980" style="s2">see that you&#39;ve got spring and fall and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.720" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">spring and fall and things are born and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.980" end="00:39:39.090" style="s2">die but over the course of deep time you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:40.710" style="s2">look at the fossil record there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.090" end="00:39:41.880" style="s2">evolution of new organisms that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.710" end="00:39:45.180" style="s2">there before</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:46.770" style="s2">so there is net change over time while</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.180" end="00:39:48.090" style="s2">there are cycles and how that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.770" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">it&#39;s important to understand that there</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.090" end="00:39:53.790" style="s2">are cycles because that means that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:56.910" style="s2">how you proceed in becoming you need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.790" end="00:39:59.670" style="s2">have phases of activity and phases of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.910" end="00:40:02.250" style="s2">rest phases of going outward and phases</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.670" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">of coming inward phases of learning new</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.250" end="00:40:05.370" style="s2">things and then phases of applying that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:07.560" style="s2">learning phase of learning new things</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.370" end="00:40:09.990" style="s2">phases of digesting and you know taking</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.560" end="00:40:12.810" style="s2">taking that to process with everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.990" end="00:40:14.580" style="s2">else you know if you don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.810" end="00:40:17.850" style="s2">there are cycles every time it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.580" end="00:40:19.620" style="s2">come inward or to digest or to learn</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.850" end="00:40:22.920" style="s2">something new or to step back you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.620" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">feel like you&#39;re not making progress but</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.920" end="00:40:28.280" style="s2">the key is that those like this or</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:30.690" style="s2">you&#39;ll never want to sleep right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.280" end="00:40:33.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve gone through phases where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.690" end="00:40:37.820" style="s2">pushing pushing pushing and then crash</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.650" end="00:40:40.710" style="s2">and it looked you know in hearing this I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.820" end="00:40:43.530" style="s2">could have been more sensitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.710" end="00:40:45.210" style="s2">fact that it has to cycle in that way so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.530" end="00:40:47.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to push and then crash</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.210" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">where the cycle forces itself on you you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.310" end="00:40:53.910" style="s2">can go with it and you actually you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">optimize yourself over time hmm now at</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.910" end="00:40:58.110" style="s2">the same time you realize that within</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:40:59.700" style="s2">that cycle net growth is happening so</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.110" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">you might come back to it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.700" end="00:41:04.020" style="s2">how I can see this in some aspects of my</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:06.180" style="s2">life but then I completely neglect them</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.020" end="00:41:07.620" style="s2">and others right right</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.180" end="00:41:09.450" style="s2">well now the area&#39;s you&#39;ve neglected</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.620" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">them and you can start looking at and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.450" end="00:41:14.370" style="s2">saying where am i pushing where it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:16.770" style="s2">inexorable that there is a cycle that if</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.370" end="00:41:18.900" style="s2">I give space to it I&#39;ll actually get go</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.770" end="00:41:20.610" style="s2">further faster and I&#39;ll enjoy the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.900" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">process more my being and my becoming</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.610" end="00:41:26.280" style="s2">well both of all yeah so now we put this</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:28.020" style="s2">together right and if we have a model of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.280" end="00:41:33.380" style="s2">time in which cycles happen but net</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.020" end="00:41:34.680" style="s2">growth also happens then and we start to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.380" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.680" end="00:41:39.500" style="s2">to reconcile all the elements of both of</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:42.630" style="s2">those do we want to be unconditionally</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.500" end="00:41:45.590" style="s2">able to access fullness and contentment</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.630" end="00:41:47.850" style="s2">now yes do we want to be able to access</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.590" end="00:41:50.310" style="s2">creative desire and passion about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.850" end="00:41:54.440" style="s2">future yes do we want to be excited</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.310" end="00:41:57.210" style="s2">about making something happen and not</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.440" end="00:42:01.700" style="s2">devastated if it doesn&#39;t happen yes both</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.210" end="00:42:01.700" style="s2">at the same time right do we want to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.740" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">optimizing our dopamine or Jick circuits</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.030" end="00:42:09.630" style="s2">or our serotonergic circuits yes both</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:11.160" style="s2">right the fullness of the human</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.630" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">experience and so we can see how</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:16.830" style="s2">different cultures were or pioneering</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">the insights that now we can synthesize</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.830" end="00:42:20.970" style="s2">right they were pioneering how to really</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:24.120" style="s2">bring those insights and practices about</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.970" end="00:42:26.190" style="s2">where now as a global people that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.120" end="00:42:27.300" style="s2">harvest the wisdom from all these</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.190" end="00:42:29.370" style="s2">cultures right here together we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.300" end="00:42:31.140" style="s2">really start to synthesize how do we be</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.370" end="00:42:34.950" style="s2">in the moment fully and be becoming</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.140" end="00:42:36.420" style="s2">fully and so the fullness of the human</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.950" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">experience is both and if we look at it</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.420" end="00:42:42.120" style="s2">like this so here&#39;s someone and I want</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.560" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">to love them unconditionally the way</p>

<p begin="00:42:46.710" end="00:42:52.380" style="s2">and forth between them when I really get</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.220" end="00:42:54.750" style="s2">it I realize that they&#39;re the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.380" end="00:42:56.580" style="s2">thing the cylinder is actually one thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.750" end="00:42:59.550" style="s2">it isn&#39;t a bunch of circles stacked up</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.580" end="00:43:02.550" style="s2">is one thing right yeah if I love them</p>

<p begin="00:43:02.550" end="00:43:07.350" style="s2">are is not actually a static thing they</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.010" end="00:43:08.580" style="s2">are a verb right they are different than</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.350" end="00:43:10.110" style="s2">they were yesterday they will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.580" end="00:43:12.270" style="s2">different tomorrow there&#39;s a sameness</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.110" end="00:43:14.730" style="s2">but there&#39;s a becoming that is part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.270" end="00:43:17.460" style="s2">their being and because there is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.730" end="00:43:19.560" style="s2">impulse in them to express who they are</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.460" end="00:43:21.480" style="s2">more and more fully to self-actualize to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.560" end="00:43:23.400" style="s2">self realize to add to universe to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.480" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">realize the depths of what&#39;s possible</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.549" end="00:46:52.849" style="s2">all of the drama and fear and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.380" end="00:46:55.400" style="s2">conditioning and nonsense actually see</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.620" end="00:47:10.760" style="s2">I want to help it deal with it when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.140" end="00:47:10.760" style="s2">help it express who it really is more</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.200" end="00:47:25.380" style="s2">this reminds me of I I like I think I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.280" end="00:47:27.300" style="s2">create almost look like workarounds when</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.380" end="00:47:28.770" style="s2">I recognized something in a workaround I</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.300" end="00:47:31.650" style="s2">I came up with</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.770" end="00:47:34.290" style="s2">I&#39;m not recognizing as a workaround</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.650" end="00:47:37.640" style="s2">potentially and then you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.290" end="00:47:39.990" style="s2">what you think about it which is when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.640" end="00:47:43.500" style="s2">if I&#39;m getting upset with somebody or</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.990" end="00:47:45.150" style="s2">somebody&#39;s getting upset with me I the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.500" end="00:47:49.590" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been framing it my mind is</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:51.870" style="s2">their story is upset with my story who</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.590" end="00:47:55.410" style="s2">they are is not really upset with who I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.870" end="00:47:58.080" style="s2">am they love you know if they were</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.410" end="00:47:59.550" style="s2">seeing me just for who I was or who I am</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.080" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">and I&#39;m seeing them for who they are</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.550" end="00:48:04.500" style="s2">then I would just love them it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:07.020" style="s2">stories that are that are in the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.500" end="00:48:09.230" style="s2">would that be would that be accurate or</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.020" end="00:48:14.330" style="s2">do you think that&#39;s a workaround</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.230" end="00:48:14.330" style="s2">yeah so let me say it another way</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.410" end="00:48:21.829" style="s2">Rosenburg the developer of the nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.210" end="00:48:25.720" style="s2">communication system had a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.829" end="00:48:29.030" style="s2">saying this point said our fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.720" end="00:48:32.690" style="s2">needs and our fundamental values always</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.030" end="00:48:34.280" style="s2">work together sometimes our strategies</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.690" end="00:48:36.230" style="s2">for how we go about acting on those</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.280" end="00:48:37.849" style="s2">values or meeting those needs don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.230" end="00:48:39.230" style="s2">together and sometimes we get very</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.849" end="00:48:41.839" style="s2">attached to the strategies and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.230" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">even make a distinction right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.839" end="00:48:48.650" style="s2">a couple and one of them is having</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:50.450" style="s2">they&#39;re fighting about like you never go</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.650" end="00:48:51.980" style="s2">places and go to parties with me and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.450" end="00:48:53.809" style="s2">never give me space and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.980" end="00:48:57.589" style="s2">like that they&#39;re in that dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.809" end="00:49:00.349" style="s2">they and one of them is really wanting</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.589" end="00:49:01.490" style="s2">the other person to go interact with</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.349" end="00:49:03.170" style="s2">their friends and the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.490" end="00:49:05.150" style="s2">really wanting to be about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.170" end="00:49:07.789" style="s2">and it seems like they are unreconciled</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.150" end="00:49:09.890" style="s2">things that they want and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.789" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">million versions of this right but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.890" end="00:49:12.520" style="s2">underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.970" end="00:49:18.980" style="s2">one person is usually wanting more that</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.940" end="00:49:21.230" style="s2">their actual need or values around</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.980" end="00:49:24.349" style="s2">connection when the truth is most people</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.230" end="00:49:26.680" style="s2">value connection and one of the and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.349" end="00:49:29.510" style="s2">other person might be valuing</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.680" end="00:49:32.000" style="s2">sovereignty you know or individuality</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.510" end="00:49:34.460" style="s2">freedom both people actually value</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.000" end="00:49:36.650" style="s2">freedom right and so when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.460" end="00:49:38.060" style="s2">what is actually the essential value</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.650" end="00:49:39.800" style="s2">that I have here you&#39;ll realize we</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.060" end="00:49:41.300" style="s2">actually share this and they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.800" end="00:49:43.369" style="s2"> I want you to have freedom I want</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.300" end="00:49:45.109" style="s2">to freedom to oh I want you to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.369" end="00:49:46.940" style="s2">connection I want to have that too then</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.109" end="00:49:48.710" style="s2">you say if we were if we stopped being</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.940" end="00:49:50.450" style="s2">focused on I can only have connection if</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.710" end="00:49:51.859" style="s2">you do this thing with me this way which</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.450" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">might be something you actually hate but</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.859" end="00:49:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of other things you might</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.150" style="s2">like to do that we could connect on</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.320" end="00:49:59.930" style="s2">that&#39;s the strategy that&#39;s the strategy</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.150" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">or I can only have freedom if I don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.930" end="00:50:03.650" style="s2">this thing and I do this other thing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.060" style="s2">right maybe I can have the freedom to</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.650" end="00:50:06.800" style="s2">choose to do that rather than feel</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.060" end="00:50:09.320" style="s2">forced into it knowing that I&#39;m choosing</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.800" end="00:50:12.349" style="s2">it right you know so if you let go of</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.320" end="00:50:14.390" style="s2">the strategies and you come to the needs</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.349" end="00:50:16.340" style="s2">you say are there ever a time where</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.390" end="00:50:18.290" style="s2">those needs don&#39;t work together no they</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.340" end="00:50:20.210" style="s2">always work together or those values</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.290" end="00:50:22.040" style="s2">those values always work together so</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.210" end="00:50:25.580" style="s2">then to the degree we can actually chill</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.040" end="00:50:27.560" style="s2">out on the strategies and say is there a</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.580" end="00:50:28.670" style="s2">strategy that meets all the needs that</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.560" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">fulfills all the value simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.670" end="00:50:34.520" style="s2">there always will be yeah okay and this</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:36.470" style="s2">is another place of like getting past a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.520" end="00:50:39.589" style="s2">false dichotomy it seems like these are</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.470" end="00:50:41.660" style="s2">unreconciled but when you can step to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.589" end="00:50:46.460" style="s2">higher level right the level of values</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">not strategy they are reconcilable with</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.460" end="00:50:56.869" style="s2">this with this perspective I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">people are thinking now what&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.869" end="00:51:02.170" style="s2">nothing stopping us from loving each</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:02.170" style="s2">other fully</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.180" end="00:51:11.440" style="s2">why do we prefer some people over others</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.000" end="00:51:17.790" style="s2">and and who we connect with mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:20.319" style="s2">a very deep question why do we or why</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.790" end="00:51:22.900" style="s2">should we continue to as we have all</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.319" end="00:51:25.150" style="s2">were very different oh we do</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.900" end="00:51:27.190" style="s2">historically for a bunch of mostly</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.150" end="00:51:31.000" style="s2">unconscious and not really great reasons</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.190" end="00:51:34.540" style="s2">right we prefer some people because</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.000" end="00:51:36.220" style="s2">they&#39;re the color that we&#39;re used to or</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.540" end="00:51:38.980" style="s2">because they&#39;re wealthy or because</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.220" end="00:51:42.609" style="s2">they&#39;re hot or because they&#39;re mostly</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.980" end="00:51:44.770" style="s2">like one that one is their right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.609" end="00:51:47.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a where your biology program to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.770" end="00:51:49.960" style="s2">you I was gonna ask about that how much</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.800" end="00:51:52.420" style="s2">of that is biology and how much of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.960" end="00:51:55.869" style="s2">is culture well because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.420" end="00:51:59.800" style="s2">definitely you know our our you look at</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.869" end="00:52:02.680" style="s2">what a model look like fifty years ago</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.800" end="00:52:04.540" style="s2">even now any difference and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.680" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">different cultures find beautiful there</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.540" end="00:52:07.059" style="s2">are differences there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:09.970" style="s2">similarities the similarities our</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.059" end="00:52:11.980" style="s2">evolutionary biology and that relate to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.970" end="00:52:16.030" style="s2">fertility right signs of fertility and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.980" end="00:52:19.079" style="s2">the the differences are culture but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.030" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">point is those are both conditioned now</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.079" end="00:52:25.809" style="s2">you relate with those but how many</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:27.849" style="s2">people are there that I could find</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.809" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">really hot from an evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.849" end="00:52:34.440" style="s2">point of view it would be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:37.140" style="s2">terrible matches for me most of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.440" end="00:52:38.730" style="s2">ain&#39;t like it&#39;s not hard to go to a gym</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.140" end="00:52:42.290" style="s2">or go to a beach and see a bunch of guys</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.730" end="00:52:45.180" style="s2">or girls that are hot regularly and yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.290" end="00:52:48.510" style="s2">they you might have almost exactly</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.180" end="00:52:50.040" style="s2">opposite core core worldviews values</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.510" end="00:52:51.690" style="s2">ideals beliefs you might be very</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.040" end="00:52:54.630" style="s2">symbiotic with supporting each other on</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.690" end="00:52:56.609" style="s2">a path or not and so it&#39;s not that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.630" end="00:53:00.890" style="s2">is a completely meaningless metric but</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.609" end="00:53:00.890" style="s2">it it&#39;s a metric that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.430" end="00:53:08.250" style="s2">make sure does not override your</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.130" end="00:53:10.690" style="s2">assessment of all the other metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.250" end="00:53:14.260" style="s2">especially as you if you are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.690" end="00:53:17.470" style="s2">about enduring relationship if that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.260" end="00:53:20.420" style="s2">metric will fade period</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.470" end="00:53:22.700" style="s2">it will fade because aging will change</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.420" end="00:53:24.460" style="s2">aesthetics and it will fade because even</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.700" end="00:53:27.350" style="s2">before aging changes aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.460" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">chemistry wears off as soon as it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.350" end="00:53:32.930" style="s2">longer new and novel and if you think of</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:34.850" style="s2">it from an evolutionary biology point of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.930" end="00:53:37.820" style="s2">view there&#39;s a lot of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.850" end="00:53:42.110" style="s2">advantage to staying together long</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.820" end="00:53:43.940" style="s2">enough to make sure that offspring</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.110" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">happens and then there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.940" end="00:53:46.940" style="s2">evolutionary advantage to have more</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">offspring in more places so that some of</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.940" end="00:53:52.970" style="s2">them will get through right yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:56.330" style="s2">that looks like serial monogamy right</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.970" end="00:53:57.710" style="s2">that looks like fall in love and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.330" end="00:53:58.850" style="s2">fall out of love fall in love somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.710" end="00:54:01.640" style="s2">else if it&#39;s not falling in love it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.850" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">falling in biochemical procreation</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.640" end="00:54:07.900" style="s2">patterns and then rationalizing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:11.840" style="s2">love that is all really nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.900" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">just so realizing that that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.840" end="00:54:17.240" style="s2">fade then you say all right how control</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:18.680" style="s2">by that do I want to be versus how much</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.240" end="00:54:20.300" style="s2">do I want to create something enduring</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.680" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">what is an enduring basis of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.300" end="00:54:24.500" style="s2">relationship and this is going to be now</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:27.260" style="s2">this comes to being and becoming again</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.500" end="00:54:29.120" style="s2">our beings need to connect and our B</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.260" end="00:54:30.770" style="s2">comings need to connect if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.120" end="00:54:32.510" style="s2">have a relationship that&#39;s enduring who</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.770" end="00:54:34.310" style="s2">they are becoming and who I am becoming</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.510" end="00:54:37.100" style="s2">actually need to connect so that as time</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.310" end="00:54:38.660" style="s2">goes on we are on deeper and deeper</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.100" end="00:54:41.390" style="s2">paths so you see a lot of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:42.560" style="s2">like they&#39;re vectors are crossing so for</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.390" end="00:54:44.240" style="s2">a while they&#39;re coming closer together</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.560" end="00:54:47.200" style="s2">and then they cross and then they start</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.240" end="00:54:49.520" style="s2">going further apart and to stay together</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.200" end="00:54:51.650" style="s2">they actually have someone has to pull</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.520" end="00:54:53.600" style="s2">the other one off their path mmm or they</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.650" end="00:54:55.370" style="s2">go further apart there are other people</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.600" end="00:54:57.050" style="s2">where it&#39;s almost like two converging</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.370" end="00:54:58.850" style="s2">vectors right like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.050" end="00:55:02.840" style="s2">asymptotically converging towards each</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.850" end="00:55:06.830" style="s2">other and this is why part of a good fit</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.840" end="00:55:10.370" style="s2">is is not just does our lifestyle fit do</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.830" end="00:55:12.140" style="s2">our way of being now fit to our</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.370" end="00:55:14.660" style="s2">chemistry&#39;s fit but it&#39;s actually do our</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.140" end="00:55:18.070" style="s2">deepest aspirations and our basis for</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.660" end="00:55:20.380" style="s2">choice and our visions of the future fit</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.070" end="00:55:23.470" style="s2">which is this is super meaningful right</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.380" end="00:55:28.150" style="s2">very and because this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.470" end="00:55:31.510" style="s2">people I imagine are exploring</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.150" end="00:55:33.160" style="s2">superficially mm-hmm and it might be</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.510" end="00:55:34.630" style="s2">superficially like do you want kids I</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.160" end="00:55:37.540" style="s2">want kids or you can make enough money</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.630" end="00:55:40.540" style="s2">yeah okay cool we can do this but as it</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.540" end="00:55:43.030" style="s2">goes much deeper it&#39;s one of the metrics</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.540" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">of a healthy relationship is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.030" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">becoming paths right as you are evolving</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:50.820" style="s2">you&#39;re becoming paths that you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:50.820" style="s2">evolving</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.480" end="00:55:55.200" style="s2">better because of being in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.369" end="00:55:59.010" style="s2">relationship then you would being out of</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.200" end="00:56:00.359" style="s2">it right or being in a some other one</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.010" end="00:56:04.260" style="s2">that was less good of a fit in that way</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.359" end="00:56:06.420" style="s2">and so who you you are actually being</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.260" end="00:56:08.280" style="s2">who you essentially are more fully</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.420" end="00:56:09.900" style="s2">because of their influence in your life</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.280" end="00:56:11.580" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.900" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">codependent Lea depending on them for it</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.580" end="00:56:15.060" style="s2">but it means they are an enhancement to</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">the degree they&#39;re influencing you of</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.060" end="00:56:20.220" style="s2">your own being and your own becoming and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:21.510" style="s2">you are for them oftentimes will have</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.220" end="00:56:23.880" style="s2">relationships that are more about</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.510" end="00:56:25.590" style="s2">addiction than love where I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.880" end="00:56:27.380" style="s2">being less of who I really want to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.590" end="00:56:29.490" style="s2">and then becoming less right I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.380" end="00:56:30.930" style="s2">less available to my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.490" end="00:56:33.030" style="s2">families I&#39;m absorbed as in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.930" end="00:56:34.920" style="s2">relationship I&#39;m doing my work and my</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.030" end="00:56:38.280" style="s2">dorm and my creativity and my art and my</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.920" end="00:56:41.720" style="s2">etc and I practices less but I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.280" end="00:56:46.050" style="s2">really like them right and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.720" end="00:56:47.820" style="s2">what you notice is my relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.050" end="00:56:49.650" style="s2">them is a lot more like a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.820" end="00:56:53.580" style="s2">to cocaine or heroin than a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.650" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">to an evolutionary path right it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.580" end="00:56:56.609" style="s2">about I like the hip I&#39;m getting from</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:57:00.470" style="s2">them and my life is getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.609" end="00:57:03.330" style="s2">because of it rather than I am actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.470" end="00:57:06.690" style="s2">evolving in who I essentially am one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.330" end="00:57:09.480" style="s2">the key criteria is with an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.690" end="00:57:11.730" style="s2">you become less able to enjoy anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.480" end="00:57:14.100" style="s2">else other than the addiction right this</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.730" end="00:57:15.600" style="s2">if if you&#39;re addicted to coke when</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.100" end="00:57:17.580" style="s2">you&#39;re coming down off coke the Sun sets</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.600" end="00:57:19.380" style="s2">not beautiful right flowers don&#39;t smoke</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.580" end="00:57:21.210" style="s2">only getting some more coke is the only</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.380" end="00:57:25.530" style="s2">thing right and if you don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.210" end="00:57:27.210" style="s2">coke everything else and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.530" end="00:57:28.859" style="s2">focused on pleasure but it&#39;s becoming</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.210" end="00:57:33.810" style="s2">more and more and more focused on one</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.859" end="00:57:36.330" style="s2">source as one is moving in their actual</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.810" end="00:57:38.490" style="s2">enlightenment right there being</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.330" end="00:57:40.230" style="s2">direction right the eastern side of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.490" end="00:57:42.840" style="s2">is their ability to love everything more</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.230" end="00:57:44.609" style="s2">to get to get connection pleasure with</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.840" end="00:57:46.410" style="s2">everything more and as they&#39;re evolving</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.609" end="00:57:47.790" style="s2">they&#39;re becoming they have ability to</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.410" end="00:57:49.859" style="s2">contributes everything more and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.790" end="00:57:51.810" style="s2">their being is evolving through they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.859" end="00:57:54.119" style="s2">becoming right they&#39;re actually evolving</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.810" end="00:57:58.200" style="s2">which is a becoming thing in their being</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.119" end="00:58:00.750" style="s2">and so if I have a relationship that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.200" end="00:58:02.220" style="s2">like cocaine what it means is if they</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.750" end="00:58:03.750" style="s2">aren&#39;t calling me back there it takes me</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.220" end="00:58:05.420" style="s2">back I can&#39;t think about anything else</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.750" end="00:58:07.790" style="s2">I can&#39;t chill out I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.420" end="00:58:10.040" style="s2">I&#39;m up right life&#39;s meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.790" end="00:58:11.000" style="s2">and but when there when I get the hit</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.040" end="00:58:14.359" style="s2">everything&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.000" end="00:58:17.000" style="s2">that&#39;s addiction not love if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.359" end="00:58:19.579" style="s2">actually a meaningful evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.000" end="00:58:21.290" style="s2">relationship my ability to show up to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.579" end="00:58:23.210" style="s2">everything else in my life increases</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.290" end="00:58:24.619" style="s2">because of them my ability to love and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.210" end="00:58:26.450" style="s2">appreciate everything else increased</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.619" end="00:58:27.410" style="s2">because I become a better friend because</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.450" end="00:58:29.240" style="s2">I&#39;m learning how to communicate better</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.410" end="00:58:30.380" style="s2">from them I started loving and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.240" end="00:58:40.010" style="s2">appreciating other people more because</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.380" end="00:58:47.990" style="s2">my heart so many more how long I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.010" end="00:58:50.690" style="s2">think we&#39;d get into dating but I find</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.990" end="00:58:54.500" style="s2">myself people asking me for advice about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.690" end="00:58:57.109" style="s2">it and and you know I think I&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.500" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">good advice in the past for sure this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.109" end="00:59:01.579" style="s2">actually really helpful for me and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:03.200" style="s2">even being able to to see what it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.579" end="00:59:05.270" style="s2">that I have in my own relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.200" end="00:59:09.230" style="s2">being able to direct others into finding</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.270" end="00:59:12.200" style="s2">something similar how long does it take</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.230" end="00:59:15.770" style="s2">to identify for somebody to go and this</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.200" end="00:59:18.049" style="s2">is a this is an addiction or and because</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.770" end="00:59:20.329" style="s2">we&#39;re really good at tricking ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.049" end="00:59:22.549" style="s2">and you know this doesn&#39;t just apply to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.329" end="00:59:25.339" style="s2">relationships but you know we may take a</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.549" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">job or we may we make a lot of choices</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.339" end="00:59:30.710" style="s2">and well technically every everything in</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:34.940" style="s2">our life is a relationship you know we</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.710" end="00:59:36.589" style="s2">take a job where we&#39;re we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.940" end="00:59:39.109" style="s2">thing in relationship with other people</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.589" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">because everyone in the company is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.109" end="00:59:44.210" style="s2">relationship and business is just a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:46.849" style="s2">series of relationships so at what point</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.210" end="00:59:49.790" style="s2">are we how long does it take for someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.849" end="00:59:54.500" style="s2">a spot this is you know an addiction</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.790" end="00:59:57.349" style="s2">versus you know growth well you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.500" end="00:59:59.329" style="s2">actually notice the vector shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.349" end="01:00:03.220" style="s2">moment you can actually notice the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.329" end="01:00:03.220" style="s2">quality of being in the moment so</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.060" end="01:00:12.130" style="s2">am i relating to this thing in a way</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.360" end="01:00:15.380" style="s2">where my presence to the rest of life is</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.130" end="01:00:17.420" style="s2">decreasing hmm or my presence of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.380" end="01:00:19.070" style="s2">rest of life is increasing I&#39;m doing a</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.420" end="01:00:20.570" style="s2">bodybuilding competition and all I can</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.070" end="01:00:22.340" style="s2">think about the bodybuilding competition</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.570" end="01:00:24.620" style="s2">and if I lose everything sucks in life</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.340" end="01:00:27.740" style="s2">and I actually don&#39;t really love the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.620" end="01:00:31.250" style="s2">people in front of me actively and I mmm</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.740" end="01:00:32.840" style="s2">that might be an effective mindset to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.250" end="01:00:34.580" style="s2">take to be obsessed about doing the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.840" end="01:00:36.980" style="s2">bodybuilding thing but here&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.580" end="01:00:39.860" style="s2">question does doing create being will</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.980" end="01:00:41.330" style="s2">you actually be meaningfully happy with</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.860" end="01:00:44.750" style="s2">who you are at the end if you win</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.330" end="01:00:47.210" style="s2">no because on the becoming side right</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.750" end="01:00:50.030" style="s2">okay so I became buff but then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.210" end="01:00:53.060" style="s2">just gonna it&#39;s becoming forevers so</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.030" end="01:00:55.400" style="s2">then it&#39;s I&#39;m not happy because it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.060" end="01:00:57.530" style="s2">only mr. world need to win mr. universe</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.400" end="01:00:59.780" style="s2">or whatever so then it&#39;ll lead to more</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.530" end="01:01:03.170" style="s2">becoming it&#39;ll never lead to being in</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.780" end="01:01:05.720" style="s2">that way unless the things I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.170" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">on becoming are related to my being</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.720" end="01:01:10.130" style="s2">right I&#39;m actually evolving in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:12.110" style="s2">presence my character my and so one of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.130" end="01:01:12.770" style="s2">the key things is am I even evolving the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.110" end="01:01:15.290" style="s2">right things</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.770" end="01:01:17.380" style="s2">am I even focused on the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.290" end="01:01:19.640" style="s2">the right things or do I have a wrong</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.380" end="01:01:22.280" style="s2">causation believed I have the belief</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.640" end="01:01:23.810" style="s2">that this strategy is how I will then be</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.280" end="01:01:26.810" style="s2">happy and so I&#39;m trying to pursue</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.810" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">happiness or how much money or how buff</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.810" end="01:01:31.160" style="s2">I get or something it is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:32.510" style="s2">wrong causal strategy no amount like yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.160" end="01:01:35.030" style="s2">I might get richer yes I might get</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.510" end="01:01:36.680" style="s2">buffer no I won&#39;t get happier that</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.030" end="01:01:38.840" style="s2">actually isn&#39;t related to a mechanic of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.680" end="01:01:41.630" style="s2">happiness right and the happiness</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.840" end="01:01:43.130" style="s2">actually accessible now so then do I</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.630" end="01:01:44.660" style="s2">still have a reason to get buff or do I</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.130" end="01:01:45.950" style="s2">realize that was actually just nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.660" end="01:01:52.580" style="s2">maybe I do still have a reason to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.950" end="01:01:54.440" style="s2">buff it might be a different one yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.580" end="01:01:56.330" style="s2">your question around how when do you</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.440" end="01:02:01.790" style="s2">notice so kind of all the time you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.330" end="01:02:03.650" style="s2">notice do I feel like my I am being more</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.790" end="01:02:05.720" style="s2">of who I really want to be your question</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.650" end="01:02:07.610" style="s2">and I might becoming more of who I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.720" end="01:02:11.000" style="s2">to be because of the way I&#39;m showing up</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.610" end="01:02:14.630" style="s2">in this relationship in this job in this</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.000" end="01:02:16.820" style="s2">activity and if not if I&#39;m being less of</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.630" end="01:02:18.450" style="s2">or becoming less of what I really most</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.820" end="01:02:20.760" style="s2">value switch something</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.450" end="01:02:22.920" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s a sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.760" end="01:02:28.500" style="s2">checking in process mhm</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.920" end="01:02:30.200" style="s2">I think that&#39;s that&#39;s something that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.500" end="01:02:32.880" style="s2">might want to look into doing more is</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.200" end="01:02:35.880" style="s2">how often are we checking and reflecting</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.880" end="01:02:37.559" style="s2">on what&#39;s going on well this is what</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.880" end="01:02:39.480" style="s2">mindfulness means is that can become</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.559" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">continuous there can be a continuous</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.480" end="01:02:44.490" style="s2">noticing so there can be real-time</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:46.079" style="s2">correction because especially as one</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.490" end="01:02:49.799" style="s2">gets more powerful there so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.079" end="01:02:51.569" style="s2">moving faster then it when they get a</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.799" end="01:02:53.279" style="s2">little bit off if they don&#39;t check in as</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.569" end="01:02:55.349" style="s2">fast they can get much further off of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.279" end="01:02:58.019" style="s2">what really matters right quickly</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.349" end="01:03:01.740" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s a good argument for</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.019" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">the practicalness practice and is an</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.740" end="01:03:06.119" style="s2">argument for why it&#39;s some more</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:06.690" style="s2">important the more powerful you get yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.119" end="01:03:07.980" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.690" end="01:03:16.799" style="s2">it&#39;s the faster you&#39;re going the more</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.980" end="01:03:18.839" style="s2">steering matters what what are your</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.799" end="01:03:22.019" style="s2">favorite mindfulness practices or what</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.839" end="01:03:25.030" style="s2">is your what is your preferred method of</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.019" end="01:03:27.320" style="s2">improving mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.030" end="01:03:30.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge topic right mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.320" end="01:03:32.600" style="s2">basically means noticing what are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.200" end="01:03:35.300" style="s2">noticing so I can be mindful of my</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.600" end="01:03:38.230" style="s2">breath and so I&#39;m noticing my breath and</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.300" end="01:03:40.520" style="s2">the process noticing my body rising oh I</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.230" end="01:03:41.000" style="s2">wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t actually breathing very</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.520" end="01:03:42.890" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.000" end="01:03:44.600" style="s2">or there&#39;s tightness or pain in my body</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.890" end="01:03:46.250" style="s2">I&#39;m haven&#39;t been paying attention to or</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.600" end="01:03:47.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of anxiety I wasn&#39;t paying</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.250" end="01:03:51.050" style="s2">attention to what do I want to do about</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.720" end="01:03:52.460" style="s2">that right that may help you feel a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.050" end="01:03:53.900" style="s2">better in your body might help you</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.460" end="01:03:54.770" style="s2">change things you need to change and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.900" end="01:03:56.030" style="s2">hope you live longer</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.770" end="01:03:59.600" style="s2">right because you notice something you</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.030" end="01:04:01.940" style="s2">tend to it so there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.600" end="01:04:03.770" style="s2">body based mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.940" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">there&#39;s noticing your thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.770" end="01:04:09.280" style="s2">noticing how many of your thoughts are</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.109" end="01:04:15.000" style="s2">fundamentally in a positive empowering</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.309" end="01:04:18.250" style="s2">direction and how many of them are</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.000" end="01:04:19.869" style="s2">basically have no meaningful utility</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.250" end="01:04:22.809" style="s2">right like they are negative but not</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.869" end="01:04:24.490" style="s2">negative in a constructive way and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.809" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">as soon as you notice that when you</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.490" end="01:04:26.680" style="s2">don&#39;t notice that you really have no</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:28.210" style="s2">choice cuz it&#39;s just an automated</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.680" end="01:04:29.710" style="s2">program running itself out you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.210" end="01:04:32.049" style="s2">choose the moment you notice it choice</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.710" end="01:04:34.150" style="s2">enters the possibility for choice enters</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.049" end="01:04:35.019" style="s2">you can say well do those thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.150" end="01:04:36.609" style="s2">affect how I feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.019" end="01:04:38.260" style="s2">yes do they affect how I perceive you</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.609" end="01:04:40.690" style="s2">have to they affect how I act yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.260" end="01:04:41.950" style="s2">how do I want to shift the thoughts so</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.690" end="01:04:42.809" style="s2">that I perceive enact it feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.950" end="01:04:45.400" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.809" end="01:04:47.740" style="s2">you can notice your emotion similarly</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.400" end="01:04:51.339" style="s2">and say oh when I notice I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.740" end="01:04:53.859" style="s2">angry or agitated etcetera then I want</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.339" end="01:04:55.569" style="s2">to actually stop and see what I can do</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.859" end="01:04:57.309" style="s2">to shift my state and recenter because</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.569" end="01:04:59.410" style="s2">if I&#39;m acting from that state that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.309" end="01:05:01.839" style="s2">gonna be subtly affecting how I perceive</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.410" end="01:05:04.420" style="s2">and how I behave there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.839" end="01:05:06.430" style="s2">you can notice you can notice that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.420" end="01:05:08.700" style="s2">talking about here being in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.430" end="01:05:08.700" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.450" end="01:05:14.849" style="s2">your own sense of being on path and</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.869" end="01:05:18.150" style="s2">being in relationship and how those</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.849" end="01:05:20.880" style="s2">relate to each other so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.150" end="01:05:24.420" style="s2">good mindfulness practices for various</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.880" end="01:05:26.550" style="s2">aspects of it and they cross apply right</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.420" end="01:05:31.020" style="s2">just increasing awareness is valuable</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.550" end="01:05:34.109" style="s2">but I would say a very deep one is if</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.020" end="01:05:36.599" style="s2">someone takes some time to write around</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.109" end="01:05:38.820" style="s2">being like you were saying I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.599" end="01:05:41.040" style="s2">a person that invokes people&#39;s trust in</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.820" end="01:05:46.339" style="s2">is worthy of it want to be a person who</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.040" end="01:05:48.420" style="s2">has character that leads to me being a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.339" end="01:05:50.579" style="s2">support and a pillar for the community</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.420" end="01:05:52.380" style="s2">not because I asked to be but because</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.579" end="01:05:53.940" style="s2">people just recognize that I show up in</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.380" end="01:05:56.540" style="s2">a way that supports me buddy so you kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.940" end="01:05:59.460" style="s2">of look who do I really want to be and</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.540" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">then what how do I most want to become</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.460" end="01:06:02.099" style="s2">what I most want to do what are the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.339" style="s2">things I really want to contribute to it</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.099" end="01:06:07.740" style="s2">and you mind this and then you ask why</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.339" end="01:06:09.180" style="s2">on all these things and you say how much</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.740" end="01:06:10.710" style="s2">of that is still because of some</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.180" end="01:06:12.150" style="s2">unconscious that my parents taught</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.710" end="01:06:13.650" style="s2">me how much of it is still because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.150" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">insecure and don&#39;t think I&#39;m enough and</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.650" end="01:06:19.230" style="s2">this is my compensation strategy and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:20.760" style="s2">then you see can I let that go and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.230" end="01:06:23.069" style="s2">what do I actually want underneath that</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.760" end="01:06:26.940" style="s2">and you get deeper and deeper of what do</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.069" end="01:06:30.690" style="s2">I really value and then you&#39;re mindful</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.940" end="01:06:32.819" style="s2">of is what I&#39;m doing right now is what</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.690" end="01:06:35.460" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking right now is the state I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.819" end="01:06:37.300" style="s2">in right now aligned with what I most</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.460" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">deeply value</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.300" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">and if so great and if not shift</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.859" end="01:06:49.130" style="s2">simplicity I think that&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.059" end="01:06:51.500" style="s2">probably one of the not probably I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.130" end="01:06:55.309" style="s2">that&#39;s the best explanation around</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.500" end="01:06:57.829" style="s2">mindfulness and the argument for why you</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.309" end="01:07:03.579" style="s2">might pick up a meditation practice</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.829" end="01:07:03.579" style="s2">which is a practice of noticing</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.300" end="01:07:08.690" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.140" end="01:07:16.180" style="s2">is not yeah there&#39;s not intentional plug</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.390" end="01:07:18.340" style="s2">even but the supplement quality which</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.180" end="01:07:24.010" style="s2">you created I&#39;ve been taking it for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.340" end="01:07:28.270" style="s2">year I&#39;ve noticed that it has helped</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.010" end="01:07:30.550" style="s2">create an expanded awareness for myself</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.270" end="01:07:33.700" style="s2">and then I would say my wife even</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.550" end="01:07:41.850" style="s2">explain what she&#39;s report has been much</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.700" end="01:07:41.850" style="s2">more dramatic even so that there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.230" end="01:07:48.580" style="s2">it&#39;s taking a supplement like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.690" end="01:07:51.180" style="s2">adding if you&#39;re not having that</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.580" end="01:07:54.130" style="s2">mindfulness practice and just taking it</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.180" end="01:07:55.980" style="s2">unconsciously you&#39;re gonna fire the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.130" end="01:08:05.070" style="s2">rocket in the wrong direction</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.980" end="01:08:11.440" style="s2">good yeah we&#39;ve had many people describe</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.070" end="01:08:13.030" style="s2">being unqualified that the effect it had</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.440" end="01:08:16.540" style="s2">on neuro chemistry</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.030" end="01:08:18.820" style="s2">getting more balanced for them actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.540" end="01:08:20.170" style="s2">help them get clear where they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.820" end="01:08:21.760" style="s2">before because it helped shift their</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.170" end="01:08:23.710" style="s2">state and so as they were shifting out</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.760" end="01:08:27.910" style="s2">of agitation or anger or depression or</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.710" end="01:08:29.650" style="s2">whatever into more centered empowered</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.910" end="01:08:31.120" style="s2">states none of these are medical claims</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.650" end="01:08:33.490" style="s2">make no medical claims but this is what</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.120" end="01:08:35.320" style="s2">people reported some of their experience</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.490" end="01:08:38.680" style="s2">that it led to them being able to hold</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.320" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">clarity morin you know etc many people</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.680" end="01:08:44.020" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s things for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:45.640" style="s2">body&#39;s endocrine system to balance it</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.020" end="01:08:50.920" style="s2">out so you&#39;re less likely to get swayed</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.640" end="01:08:54.100" style="s2">by triggers so or maybe we shouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.920" end="01:08:58.420" style="s2">can you make these types of comments I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.100" end="01:09:01.030" style="s2">guess let me finish we&#39;re was not sort</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.420" end="01:09:04.240" style="s2">of acting on the mechanism because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.030" end="01:09:07.300" style="s2">all relevant so other people have</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.240" end="01:09:09.700" style="s2">described that when they feel on right</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.300" end="01:09:12.190" style="s2">they feel generally centered they take</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.700" end="01:09:13.780" style="s2">qualia they feel a lot better they feel</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.190" end="01:09:16.450" style="s2">like they have more power nitrous right</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.780" end="01:09:18.070" style="s2">into the system when they are off</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.450" end="01:09:20.890" style="s2">they&#39;re angry they&#39;re agitated wherever</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.070" end="01:09:22.630" style="s2">they take qualia then they feel more</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.890" end="01:09:24.910" style="s2">empowered but they&#39;re not directing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.630" end="01:09:26.050" style="s2">and in a way right like the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.910" end="01:09:27.730" style="s2">not directing their thoughts very</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.050" end="01:09:29.770" style="s2">sovereignly and so now they actually</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.730" end="01:09:33.880" style="s2">feel kind of more of that going on so</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.770" end="01:09:35.710" style="s2">for most people it has been supportive</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.880" end="01:09:38.590" style="s2">for them coming to Center if they are</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.710" end="01:09:40.630" style="s2">not but for some people the order of</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.590" end="01:09:43.300" style="s2">operations assets that more centering</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.630" end="01:09:44.740" style="s2">would be more software side would be no</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.300" end="01:09:46.660" style="s2">relevant first or at least in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.740" end="01:09:50.140" style="s2">conjunction with well you think about it</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.660" end="01:09:51.370" style="s2">and relate it back to like or what would</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.140" end="01:09:55.750" style="s2">a supplement have to do with anything</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.370" end="01:09:59.140" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about if you think of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.750" end="01:10:01.570" style="s2">brain and the associated rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.140" end="01:10:05.320" style="s2">physiology as the hardware right the bio</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.570" end="01:10:07.990" style="s2">hardware mm-hmm that the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.320" end="01:10:11.500" style="s2">software of thought and emotion is</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.990" end="01:10:13.140" style="s2">running on except that the division</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.500" end="01:10:16.120" style="s2">between hardware and software and</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.140" end="01:10:17.980" style="s2">computers is a hard one right the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.120" end="01:10:19.960" style="s2">software is not affecting the hardware</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.980" end="01:10:23.620" style="s2">the hardware has to be adequate to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.960" end="01:10:25.510" style="s2">software to run on it in us every time</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.620" end="01:10:26.980" style="s2">you change the physiology it</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.510" end="01:10:28.870" style="s2">automatically changes the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.980" end="01:10:30.400" style="s2">predispositions for thinking and feeling</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.870" end="01:10:32.110" style="s2">and every time you have a thought or a</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.400" end="01:10:34.030" style="s2">feeling it is actually an</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.110" end="01:10:36.160" style="s2">electrochemical process that is then</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.030" end="01:10:37.990" style="s2">changing physiology so there it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.160" end="01:10:40.210" style="s2">kind of firmware that&#39;s interacting each</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.990" end="01:10:42.910" style="s2">other yeah it&#39;s not fair to think about</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.210" end="01:10:45.340" style="s2">it as a typical computer it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.910" end="01:10:47.710" style="s2">distinct but it is a fine starting place</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.340" end="01:10:49.930" style="s2">to say that most of what we call</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.710" end="01:10:52.240" style="s2">psychology is on the software side of</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.930" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">the gradient it&#39;s a gradient rather than</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.240" end="01:10:57.310" style="s2">a hard binary right and so it&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:11:00.010" style="s2">psychology is looking at what do you</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.310" end="01:11:02.800" style="s2">focus on what meaning do you make from</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.010" end="01:11:06.010" style="s2">things you know etc so mindfulness also</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.800" end="01:11:10.060" style="s2">would fit in there that most medicine</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.010" end="01:11:11.740" style="s2">and biohacking neuro hacking biophysical</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.060" end="01:11:13.900" style="s2">optimization is focused on the hardware</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.740" end="01:11:15.010" style="s2">side of things but these automatically</p>

<p begin="01:11:15.010" end="01:11:20.350" style="s2">everyone has experienced having their</p>

<p begin="01:11:20.350" end="01:11:24.100" style="s2">their hormones are out or a hangover or</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.030" end="01:11:26.980" style="s2">whatever where your physiology affects</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.100" end="01:11:29.620" style="s2">your psyche no doubt and you&#39;re angry or</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.980" end="01:11:32.860" style="s2">you&#39;re depressed or whatever because of</p>

<p begin="01:11:34.180" end="01:11:37.840" style="s2">great say they recover from a sickness</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.550" end="01:11:38.630" style="s2">now they feel good in their body again</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.840" end="01:11:40.010" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.630" end="01:11:43.610" style="s2">that automatically affects their psyche</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.010" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">right we also have noticed where you get</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.610" end="01:11:47.510" style="s2">really stressed out psychologically and</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:48.830" style="s2">you get sick right or you feel great</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.510" end="01:11:50.690" style="s2">psychologically and you feel increased</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.830" end="01:11:59.780" style="s2">energy so you can see that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.690" end="01:12:02.960" style="s2">psycho neuro in so the optimal process</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.780" end="01:12:05.300" style="s2">is to pull the levers one can in both</p>

<p begin="01:14:07.700" end="01:14:14.630" style="s2">actually our depth of feeling and our</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.980" end="01:14:16.790" style="s2">feelings of our self our feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.630" end="01:14:18.980" style="s2">whether we really are in tune or not our</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.790" end="01:14:22.730" style="s2">depth of being right presents connection</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.980" end="01:14:25.010" style="s2">with life at the moment and others are</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.730" end="01:14:27.470" style="s2">empathy and our ability to feel other</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.010" end="01:14:34.040" style="s2">people so you actually see how agency</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.470" end="01:14:36.800" style="s2">very much relates to becoming and being</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.040" end="01:14:39.890" style="s2">and sentient SAR very related and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.800" end="01:14:41.990" style="s2">intelligence can help reconcile the</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.890" end="01:14:45.830" style="s2">relationships between those so if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.990" end="01:14:48.310" style="s2">think about evolving sentient evolving</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.830" end="01:14:51.320" style="s2">sentient fully starts to look like</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.310" end="01:14:53.480" style="s2">Bodhisattva it looks like the embodiment</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.320" end="01:14:56.240" style="s2">of deep compassion embodied awareness</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.480" end="01:14:59.000" style="s2">etc evolving intelligence looks like</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.240" end="01:15:01.670" style="s2">polymath right like full genius across</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.000" end="01:15:03.890" style="s2">multiple spectrum evolving agency looks</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.670" end="01:15:07.990" style="s2">like power the ability to have more</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.890" end="01:15:11.510" style="s2">power to actually create in reality</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.990" end="01:15:14.900" style="s2">fully empowered Bodhisattva polymaths</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.510" end="01:15:17.450" style="s2">we believe our will be the new normal in</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.900" end="01:15:19.430" style="s2">the future and have to be the new normal</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.450" end="01:15:21.110" style="s2">in the future because the scope of</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.430" end="01:15:24.320" style="s2">issues that the world is facing actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.110" end="01:15:28.370" style="s2">require people who are fully caring for</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.320" end="01:15:30.230" style="s2">the whole have profound capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.370" end="01:15:32.270" style="s2">complex thinking problem-solving</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.230" end="01:15:34.310" style="s2">capabilities and a profound amount of</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.270" end="01:15:36.920" style="s2">agency to do to actually take care of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.310" end="01:15:38.480" style="s2">lot of right and so we define all</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.920" end="01:15:40.370" style="s2">of those together the volume of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.480" end="01:15:44.600" style="s2">sphere defined by the shortest of those</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.370" end="01:15:46.610" style="s2">vectors as kind of proportional semi</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.600" end="01:15:51.050" style="s2">proportional roughly to one sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.610" end="01:15:53.180" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re talking about here is</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.050" end="01:15:54.980" style="s2">you can also think of then that being</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.180" end="01:15:56.780" style="s2">and becoming are both parts of defining</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.980" end="01:15:58.430" style="s2">the sphere of what matters right and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.780" end="01:16:00.200" style="s2">relationship between them being becoming</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.430" end="01:16:02.950" style="s2">in the and the relationship between how</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.200" end="01:16:02.950" style="s2">we navigate those</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.340" end="01:16:05.790" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:13.480" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have to go back and listen to</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.990" end="01:16:17.590" style="s2">this show it&#39;s been I&#39;m not sure I have</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.480" end="01:16:19.480" style="s2">anything left to ask I definitely want</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.590" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">to have you back on for another round is</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.480" end="01:16:23.530" style="s2">there anything that you want to mention</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.470" style="s2">or something I didn&#39;t ask that I should</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.530" end="01:16:27.910" style="s2">have asked I run into this a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.470" end="01:16:30.400" style="s2">times when I&#39;m talking to somebody who</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.910" end="01:16:31.360" style="s2">knows a lot more about what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.400" end="01:16:33.400" style="s2">talking about than I do</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.360" end="01:16:35.530" style="s2">and there&#39;s always you know what</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.400" end="01:16:44.100" style="s2">question that I not asked that maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.530" end="01:16:47.560" style="s2">should have it&#39;s a very meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.100" end="01:16:50.370" style="s2">application of this dichotomy and</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.560" end="01:16:50.370" style="s2">looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.460" end="01:16:55.950" style="s2">situation in the moment which is</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.430" end="01:17:04.860" style="s2">is everything really up or is</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.970" end="01:17:08.270" style="s2">everything actually perfect right and</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.860" end="01:17:08.270" style="s2">everything tending to itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.639" end="01:17:15.780" style="s2">mmm and it&#39;s both in neither but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.179" end="01:17:17.489" style="s2">actually again the cylinder isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.780" end="01:17:19.619" style="s2">both in either circle rectangle there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.489" end="01:17:24.840" style="s2">a deeper way of understanding what that</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.619" end="01:17:26.939" style="s2">means we can look at how all the</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.840" end="01:17:28.769" style="s2">exponential technology you know your</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.939" end="01:17:30.840" style="s2">phone has the computational capability</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.769" end="01:17:34.469" style="s2">of supercomputers not that long ago we</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.840" end="01:17:36.749" style="s2">can look at all the all of the places</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.469" end="01:17:38.729" style="s2">where technology is giving us the</p>

<p begin="01:17:38.729" end="01:17:42.389" style="s2">faster that is enriching certain aspects</p>

<p begin="01:17:42.389" end="01:17:48.479" style="s2">and when they&#39;re tremendous metrics on</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.419" end="01:17:50.519" style="s2">how everything&#39;s getting better the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.479" end="01:17:52.919" style="s2">time there&#39;s all these metrics regarding</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.519" end="01:17:55.530" style="s2">biodiversity loss and ocean</p>

<p begin="01:18:05.429" end="01:18:10.229" style="s2">everything&#39;s getting worse and you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:12.389" style="s2">cherry-pick the data on either side you</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.229" end="01:18:14.039" style="s2">want look at big enough data sets</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.389" end="01:18:16.229" style="s2">things are getting exponentially worse</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.039" end="01:18:19.709" style="s2">and exponentially better at the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.229" end="01:18:21.030" style="s2">time you&#39;d say well what does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.709" end="01:18:22.159" style="s2">if things are getting exponentially</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.030" end="01:18:24.239" style="s2">better next one and she worse but</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.159" end="01:18:26.219" style="s2">obviously neither of those in our the</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.239" end="01:18:27.929" style="s2">trajectory to project what we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.219" end="01:18:29.909" style="s2">what it means is the current system is</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.929" end="01:18:31.530" style="s2">destabilizing right things are moving</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.909" end="01:18:34.380" style="s2">further and further away from a center</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.530" end="01:18:36.530" style="s2">line the system&#39;s destabilizing because</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.380" end="01:18:38.999" style="s2">we have a world system overarching lis</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.530" end="01:18:42.119" style="s2">it is coming to the end of its lifecycle</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.999" end="01:18:43.679" style="s2">at the end of its phase where we&#39;ve you</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.119" end="01:18:46.499" style="s2">know we&#39;ve had a world system that had</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.679" end="01:18:49.019" style="s2">exponentially increasing population with</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.499" end="01:18:52.050" style="s2">exponentially increasing resource per</p>

<p begin="01:18:53.550" end="01:18:57.689" style="s2">from the earth each year and turning it</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:59.669" style="s2">into trash how long can you run a linear</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.689" end="01:19:01.349" style="s2">materials economy where you take stuff</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.669" end="01:19:02.669" style="s2">out of the earth unruhe new ibly faster</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.349" end="01:19:04.139" style="s2">than it regenerates and then turn it</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.669" end="01:19:05.789" style="s2">into trash put it back in the earth on a</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.139" end="01:19:08.459" style="s2">finite planet you know with an</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.789" end="01:19:10.559" style="s2">exponential rate of you can trim it that</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.459" end="01:19:14.280" style="s2">long and we&#39;re basically at the end you</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.559" end="01:19:16.979" style="s2">know so and yet that system has given</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.280" end="01:19:19.139" style="s2">the technologies and tools that are</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.979" end="01:19:20.610" style="s2">necessary to build the next system right</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.139" end="01:19:21.840" style="s2">and so we&#39;re at this very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.610" end="01:19:24.690" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.840" end="01:19:27.810" style="s2">what is necessary for the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.690" end="01:19:30.570" style="s2">new world it is at a radically higher</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.810" end="01:19:32.520" style="s2">quality of life possible for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.570" end="01:19:34.770" style="s2">than has been possible so far is</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.520" end="01:19:37.200" style="s2">emerging but it will be a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.770" end="01:19:38.610" style="s2">redesign of everything of economics of</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.200" end="01:19:39.000" style="s2">governance of infrastructure of world</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.610" end="01:19:40.800" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.000" end="01:19:44.760" style="s2">we&#39;re also to place with a current world</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.800" end="01:19:49.020" style="s2">it really is ending and having to change</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.760" end="01:19:50.730" style="s2">and so then we it feels antiquated I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.020" end="01:19:53.010" style="s2">not sure if it&#39;s a generational thing on</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.730" end="01:19:54.930" style="s2">if every generation feels this well no</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.010" end="01:19:58.250" style="s2">this is not just generational there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.930" end="01:20:01.890" style="s2">generational stuff but there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.250" end="01:20:04.230" style="s2">since the plow we started you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.890" end="01:20:05.550" style="s2">removing stuff from Earth faster than we</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.230" end="01:20:06.690" style="s2">were regenerating it and since the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.550" end="01:20:09.720" style="s2">Industrial Revolution</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.690" end="01:20:10.890" style="s2">you know exponentially faster and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.720" end="01:20:13.800" style="s2">actually talking about the end of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.890" end="01:20:16.170" style="s2">phase that started then so it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.800" end="01:20:18.300" style="s2">long well not that long in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.170" end="01:20:24.000" style="s2">terms but the entirety of what we call</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.300" end="01:20:26.460" style="s2">recorded history yeah yeah considering</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.000" end="01:20:30.620" style="s2">so from evolutionary not long from you</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.460" end="01:20:33.750" style="s2">know from human awareness of our own</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.620" end="01:20:35.520" style="s2">history standpoint the whole of what</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.750" end="01:20:37.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve had so far as a phase coming to an</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.520" end="01:20:40.830" style="s2">end which has been a phase defined by</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.940" end="01:20:42.990" style="s2">finite games zero-sum games finite</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.830" end="01:20:44.280" style="s2">amount of resources and the total number</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.990" end="01:20:45.570" style="s2">of us are growing and were competing for</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.280" end="01:20:47.220" style="s2">those finite resources and if you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.570" end="01:20:51.840" style="s2">them I don&#39;t if I have them you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.220" end="01:20:53.520" style="s2">and so our answer is pull the resource</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.840" end="01:20:55.290" style="s2">set a nature faster and compete with</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:56.910" style="s2">each other harder and now our tools of</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.290" end="01:20:58.680" style="s2">competition our tools of warfare are big</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.910" end="01:21:00.540" style="s2">enough to destroy the entire planet and</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.680" end="01:21:02.460" style="s2">we our ability to pull the resources out</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.540" end="01:21:04.020" style="s2">is enough that it can also destroy the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.460" end="01:21:06.840" style="s2">whole planet so we&#39;ve outgrown the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.020" end="01:21:07.470" style="s2">playing field and so that game is coming</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.840" end="01:21:10.770" style="s2">to an end</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.470" end="01:21:12.600" style="s2">so either we end with that game or we</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.770" end="01:21:13.950" style="s2">create a new game in the new game will</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.600" end="01:21:15.750" style="s2">be an infinite game not a finite game</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.950" end="01:21:17.610" style="s2">it&#39;ll be a positive something zero-sum</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.750" end="01:21:21.900" style="s2">and it&#39;ll be one where fundamentally our</p>

<p begin="01:21:21.900" end="01:21:26.490" style="s2">ability to thrive or not in opposition</p>

<p begin="01:21:26.490" end="01:21:32.220" style="s2">economic model shift right it is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.130" end="01:21:33.510" style="s2">worldview shift it is and we could do</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.220" end="01:21:35.280" style="s2">another show just focused on these</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.510" end="01:21:35.760" style="s2">topics that&#39;s exactly what I was going</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.280" end="01:21:37.769" style="s2">to suggest</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.760" end="01:21:39.510" style="s2">I&#39;ve been we&#39;re going from the micro to</p>

<p begin="01:21:39.510" end="01:21:48.349" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.050" end="01:21:48.349" style="s2">yeah we live in a time when</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.640" end="01:21:52.750" style="s2">there is more</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.490" end="01:21:59.160" style="s2">at stake than there has ever been where</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.180" end="01:22:02.130" style="s2">because of the magnitude of our</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.160" end="01:22:03.450" style="s2">technology we can all affect more than</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.130" end="01:22:05.010" style="s2">anyone has ever been able to affect</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.450" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">Gandhi couldn&#39;t put things on YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.010" end="01:22:11.610" style="s2">and get virality right and so we we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:14.880" style="s2">the potential to affect things in a way</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.610" end="01:22:17.280" style="s2">that it could actually contribute to</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.880" end="01:22:19.320" style="s2">moving in the direction of humans mount</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.280" end="01:22:20.730" style="s2">continuing or a higher quality of life</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.320" end="01:22:23.940" style="s2">than anyone has ever been able to</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.730" end="01:22:26.190" style="s2">realize emerging so this is this is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.940" end="01:22:30.420" style="s2">context for all of us contemplating our</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.190" end="01:22:33.420" style="s2">becoming so the being side is I can</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.420" end="01:22:37.290" style="s2">access the same state of timeless</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.420" end="01:22:39.330" style="s2">fullness and beauty now that people</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.290" end="01:22:43.190" style="s2">could in the time of Buddha right</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.330" end="01:22:46.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s eternal it&#39;s timeless and</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.190" end="01:22:49.890" style="s2">that can be a place I can access as</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.190" end="01:22:51.810" style="s2">respite and as fuel to then come in to</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.890" end="01:22:52.920" style="s2">this actual time which is very different</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.810" end="01:22:56.400" style="s2">than the time of Buddha or any other</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.920" end="01:22:59.060" style="s2">time and say my becoming is not to win</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.400" end="01:23:01.650" style="s2">at a game that is dying</p>
