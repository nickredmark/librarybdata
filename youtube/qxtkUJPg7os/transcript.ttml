<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">been studying working on</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.640" end="00:00:11.440" style="s2">um for for years this is as uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:13.120" style="s2">what like maybe five years ago when we</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.440" end="00:00:14.719" style="s2">when we met</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.120" end="00:00:18.160" style="s2">four four or five years ago when we met</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.719" end="00:00:18.160" style="s2">i knew you were thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:21.760" style="s2">sense making and rebuilding</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">civilizations and</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.760" end="00:00:24.960" style="s2">i&#39;m curious um you know i&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">pleasure of just</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.960" end="00:00:31.359" style="s2">kind of being around you for years</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:34.239" style="s2">what&#39;s the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.359" end="00:00:35.200" style="s2">to tell probably a new audience about</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.239" end="00:00:37.840" style="s2">your work</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.200" end="00:00:37.840" style="s2">i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.320" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m wondering i&#39;m wondering your</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.440" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">favorite way to explain that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">um i know that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">have a favorite way to explain it but uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">i&#39;ll jump in if</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll give my perspective but i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">hear uh what if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">shock kind of just a brief narrative</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">is uh i was homeschooled growing up so</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:07.119" style="s2">i got to kind of make my own curriculum</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">which was fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.119" end="00:01:11.200" style="s2">uh and a lot of it had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">activism my mom was big into activism so</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.200" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">i got into</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:17.600" style="s2">environmental work and animal rights</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">work and social justice issues young</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.600" end="00:01:23.439" style="s2">and my dad was into</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">lots of areas of science and engineering</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.439" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">and philosophy so i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:31.280" style="s2">getting to have that braid of topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">and as i was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.280" end="00:01:36.240" style="s2">um exploring activism one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:38.640" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.240" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">found was how profoundly interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.640" end="00:01:41.439" style="s2">the problems were and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">the solutions weren&#39;t adequately</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.439" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">addressing them and this started showing</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.320" style="s2">all over the place in terms of looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">at why are the ecological issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.320" end="00:01:51.439" style="s2">advancing and not getting better</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">despite the huge amount of effort</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.439" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">happening in the nonprofit space and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">government for benefit</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">space what is fundamentally inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">about the nature of the solution i</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">being 13 working on helping some project</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">that was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">kenya protecting elephants from poaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">in an area that was already protected</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">that the poachers could get in</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">and so i was 13 so i was just in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">like going door-to-door raising money</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">and writing letters and</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">uh but there the people who were there</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">on the ground were having their</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">life threatened by the poaching groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:24.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">the solution was bigger fences around</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.560" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">the preserve so poachers couldn&#39;t get in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">and legislation in the country for</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:31.760" style="s2">harsher sentencing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">poachers and the solution after a couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.760" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">years of like blood sweat and tears</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">finally worked</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t address the poverty of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">people that were poaching</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">and the fact that you know they were in</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:45.120" style="s2">parts of the world where</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">uh you know 25 000 kids are starving to</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.120" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">death a day</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">it didn&#39;t address black markets on</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">animal products it didn&#39;t address</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">mindsets towards animals it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">address a macro economy that creates</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.040" style="s2">poverty at scale and you know ships it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">to the third world it didn&#39;t address any</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.040" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">of those issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">so the same poaching groups moved and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">started hunting both the mountain</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">gorilla and the white rhino more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">they had been both of which were more</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">endangered and i got to see this because</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:08.080" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">looking at one issue i was working with</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.080" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">enough groups that i got to see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">those were connected</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:15.040" style="s2">and so the tremendously hard and well</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">motivated work</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.040" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">solved one problem but actually moved</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">the underlying problem space</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">to show up in areas that were even more</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">sensitive and that&#39;s really devastating</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">because the only kind of hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">that i had to deal with the devastation</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2">of the nature of the problems was that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.680" style="s2">something could be done about it and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">uh fortunately i was also</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.680" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">studying not just all the different</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">areas of science that i could but</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">a system of science and bucky fuller&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.799" style="s2">work and capra&#39;s work and kind of how do</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.799" style="s2">how do all the things fit together</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.799" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">and so i started looking at activism</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.799" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">from that lens</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.840" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">and saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">how can we understand the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">problems well enough that we can come up</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">with solutions that solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">but also don&#39;t externalize harm</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">elsewhere and that required starting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">get into economics and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">why did this perverse incentive arise</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">and what would it take to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:12.400" style="s2">perverse incentive and externality</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">and the nature of governance systems and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.400" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">culture and basically civilization writ</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">large</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">so then that led to saying okay well</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things that we can say</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">are getting better you can listen to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">hans rosling or</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">stephen pinker and you know pick things</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">that are getting better but</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">you can also look at most</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.479" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">environmentalists or people studying</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">existential risk and look at things</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">getting worse and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">both are the case there are some metrics</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">getting better there are some getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">worse that&#39;s a destabilization of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">overall space but the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">are leading to catastrophic tipping</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">points that will</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">break the substrate that allows the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">things that are getting better to matter</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">though i start forecasting uh how</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">long do we have on the various things</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">and started reading</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">limits of growth by club of rome and uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">all of the different kind of forecasts</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">as well as studying civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">collapse theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:08.000" style="s2">uh tainter and baudrillard and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">things like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.000" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">how because it becomes pretty clear when</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">you study history that all of the great</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">empires that lived for hundreds or</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:16.880" style="s2">thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">don&#39;t still exist whether it&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.880" end="00:05:22.800" style="s2">curious how old are you when</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">when you&#39;re just you&#39;re diving into this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.800" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">uh inquiry is just so fascinated that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re so interested and have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">the dedication to dive into this when</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:36.560" style="s2">when does this occur in your life</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">i mean this kind of the threat of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">whole life just progressively deeper</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">inside the prospects you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">spend</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">if you spend time talking with kids</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">where you listen</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">and then actually give them space for</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">the questions to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:06:02.800" style="s2">uh the dedication is there like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll i do nature walks with kids</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.800" end="00:06:10.240" style="s2">and they want to ask around about</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">how do trees suck up water and how how</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.240" end="00:06:13.840" style="s2">does the light thing work and how do all</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">the animals and everything interact and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.840" end="00:06:17.600" style="s2">very deep questions they want to know</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">why the sky is blue</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">which actually requires understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">things about optics and about</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.199" style="s2">astronomy and about the sun about</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">astrophysics and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">you know as well as like the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">consciousness what is the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:33.680" style="s2">experience of blue</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">and school just doesn&#39;t do a great job</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.680" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">actually facilitating that curiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">so if we force people to be interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">in they aren&#39;t interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">and don&#39;t facilitate their interests and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:44.160" style="s2">the things they&#39;re actually interested</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">in we kind of break their interest and</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.160" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">they want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">use some hypernormal stimuli um</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">so i was just fortunate that the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">that were interesting to me i got to pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">attention to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:56.800" style="s2">and i think anyone that gets to continue</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">to pay attention to the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.800" end="00:06:59.039" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:01.520" style="s2">learns but they also double down on</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.039" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">their own interests</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.520" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">so the things i&#39;m describing now were a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">lot of my kind of teenage focus</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">and so i started looking at you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">forecasting and civilizational collapse</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">models anything from</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">environmental collapse from</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">overfishing and you know peak resource</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">utilization to pollution issues to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">you know climate type issues as well as</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:31.360" style="s2">what are the things that lead to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.639" style="s2">large-scale war</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.360" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">and infrastructure collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">those types of things and um</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">that led to recognizing that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:46.000" style="s2">our technology exponentiates and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">power of our choices exponentiate</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.000" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">but our quality of choice making is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">getting commensurately better to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:56.000" style="s2">power of our choice making</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">we&#39;re having more and more different</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.000" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">escalation pathways to catastrophic risk</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.120" style="s2">globally</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">and higher and higher probability of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.120" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">them where</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">if we try to think about like biotech</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">risks or nanotech risks or ai mediated</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">risk or</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">large-scale war grid collapse if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">tried to solve any of them on their own</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">they&#39;re almost all impossible</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">to solve and there&#39;s too many of them so</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">i started thinking about what is driving</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">all of them</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:20.400" style="s2">why are humans coordinating at scale in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">a way that uses</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.400" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">our technological power in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">either directly</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">through conflict theory cause problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">war</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:35.599" style="s2">and you know war and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">exploitation that is known or through</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.599" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">mistake theory cause problems unintended</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:41.279" style="s2">externalities</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">and a lot of it is that right like i</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.279" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">don&#39;t think the people when they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">facebook knew that it would destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.399" style="s2">entire information ecology but it did so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.399" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">nation theoretic issue so we started</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">are there is there some set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:59.279" style="s2">underlying dynamics that give</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">rise to how humans are coordinating that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.279" end="00:09:02.560" style="s2">are what gives rise to all these</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">problems the generator functions of them</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.560" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">and to just start to think about like</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">perverse incentive as long as</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">uh military industrial complex is one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">the largest blocks of the global economy</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">and war is profitable and you have uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">the capacity for the supply side to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">manufacture artificial demand</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">can you have a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">military-industrial complex that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">entire global economy depends upon and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">lasting peace in a supply and demand</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">equation</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">well no so we have to deal with perverse</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">incentive there that&#39;s one example we</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.320" style="s2">can see it in healthcare and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.560" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">can see it in mining and we can see it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.320" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">everywhere and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">you start looking at is the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">the incentive system</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">the economic system where 50 to 100</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:49.360" style="s2">trillion dollars a day of human activity</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">moves</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.360" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">but is either directly causing harm or</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">indirectly causing externality</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">could we shift that in a way where that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">incentive system what</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">what was in the incentive of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:02.640" style="s2">individual or a corporation or a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">nation was in the ins was in the well</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.640" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">aligned with the well-being of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:05.680" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">right so these were the questions i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.680" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">asking trying to study</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">the austrian school and straight kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">laissez-faire</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">approaches or socialist approaches or</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">marxist approaches or like</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">techno-optimist</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">automate everything approaches and i got</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">to see that there were strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:22.800" style="s2">weaknesses of a lot of them and none of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">them were actually adequate to space</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.800" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">so put together some research groups</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">that were working on</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">understanding the space the generator</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">functions of catastrophic risk well</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">enough to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">is there an is there a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">categorical set of solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">underlying dynamics of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">how humanity coordinates effectively</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">that is the kernel of a new civilization</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">and that when we study civilizational</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">decay of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">made rome fall and egypt and the aztecs</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">and the mayans and et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">that if we understand the dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:59.120" style="s2">give rise to civilizational collapse</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">can we have something that really</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.120" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">addresses all of those dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">addresses</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">all of the uh escalation pathways to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:09.920" style="s2">catastrophic risks we can see</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:11.360" style="s2">so so it sounds like almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.920" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">correct me if i&#39;m wrong but maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.360" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">simple way to put that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">if you were to redesign civilization</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">how would you do it is that is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">the frame of like well everything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">has these strengths and weaknesses what</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">would we do if we do it again from</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">scratch is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">kind of where you&#39;re coming from here</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">well this is a valuable question and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s an insufficient question and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.839" style="s2">spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:42.560" style="s2">time i was young asking it without</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.839" end="00:11:45.839" style="s2">recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.560" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">uh the enactment problem okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.839" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">sure we actually get there in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:54.399" style="s2">factoring that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">that all the people are conditioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.399" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">currently who are in power in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:11:59.760" style="s2">would resist that and it seems to be not</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:00.720" style="s2">in the immediate best interest of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.760" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.720" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">environment so yes it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">thought experiment if we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.440" style="s2">redesign simply say</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">scratch how would we how do we think the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.440" end="00:12:12.160" style="s2">best run planet would run</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">uh most enlightened planet would be then</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.160" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">in the current scenario what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">a viable path</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">there and some degree you reverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:22.720" style="s2">engineer from the idea of a future state</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:24.959" style="s2">to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.720" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">forward engineer how can we be vectoring</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.959" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">in the right direction and increasing</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">our capacity to continue to vector in</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">so what i&#39;m hearing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.120" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">great thought experiment hey google</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">lights on</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not uh eugene do you mind muting</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">although it&#39;s a great thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t start we can&#39;t just hit a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">button and then and then redesign you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:57.279" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">cool great thought experience to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.279" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">that vision to think about what is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">changes changes evolution</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">change is it&#39;s a it&#39;s messy</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">right to actually get to that vision we</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">actually have to start with where we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">yeah so where are we and where do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">where do you see us actually being able</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">to go from where we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">so i&#39;ll try to bridge this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:35.839" style="s2">to some of what wade was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">talking about the unraveling</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.839" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">of the american</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:47.279" style="s2">empire i think we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t claim to be representing his</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.279" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">views accurately here</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">but just kind of piggyback on some of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:53.680" style="s2">the thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:14:00.480" style="s2">we can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">united states system and say is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.480" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">undergoing civilization</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:05.920" style="s2">civilizational decay in the way that led</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:07.839" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.920" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">the breakdown of previous civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.839" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">and what would the signs of that be what</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">things can we look for we can also look</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.160" end="00:14:19.839" style="s2">at the global system that the world has</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">actually run on since world war</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.839" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">ii that has been us-based and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">important to look at these together</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.519" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">from the u.s perspective we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">you know one just kind of quick</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">insightful thing is that throughout</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">history democracies or republics systems</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">of participatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">governance that were at scale not like</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">small tribal scales</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">never made it to 300 years right they</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">have a fairly short life cycle all</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">uh empires died but some of the dynastic</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:52.160" style="s2">ones made it a thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">and the ones that were more</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.160" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">participatory governance systems lasted</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">less long the us is at around 250 years</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">depending upon</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:01.760" style="s2">you know exactly the start date you pick</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:03.440" style="s2">so this is the time cycle factoring</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.760" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">history of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">the the adequate decay of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">republican to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of reasons why uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">won&#39;t get into all of them but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.040" style="s2">the people who are willing to fight a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">revolutionary war to</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.040" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">make something happen right if they</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">lived in the direct experience of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:27.760" style="s2">tyranny of government and where they</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.760" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">willing to die rather than let</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">themselves be governed in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:34.720" style="s2">felt tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">then they&#39;re also so willing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.720" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">extraordinarily hard work of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:39.680" style="s2">participatory governance</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">which means show up at the town hall not</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.680" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">let just let somebody else make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">read all the papers be actively informed</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">so that you can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">governance because you have the direct</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:53.759" style="s2">experience of how terrible not</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:55.440" style="s2">being involved in your own governances</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.759" end="00:15:57.519" style="s2">but as time goes on and several</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.440" end="00:15:59.680" style="s2">generations pass and that just becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.519" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">myth that no one has any embodied</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.680" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">experience of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">and there&#39;s like mortgages to pay and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">stuff on tv and to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">um i don&#39;t even want to go to jury duty</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:13.279" style="s2">let alone be really actively informed</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">and engaged in participatory governance</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.279" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">so if the people</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">stop checking the state and it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">longer truly a governance of foreign by</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">the people then the state stops being</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">able to do what it&#39;s supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">which is check the predatory aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:27.839" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll just make this frame because</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">that&#39;s an important frame</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.839" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">absolutely i love it one way</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">thinking about all of the problems in</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">the world is that they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">coordination problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:42.160" style="s2">um that it&#39;s patterns of human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">at scale that cause them</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.160" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">and it needs to be different patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">human behavior at scale to solve them</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">and so how do we get lots of people to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">coordinate their behavior when they want</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">different things and they have different</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">understandings of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">different world views in ways that lead</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">better solutions for the individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:03.519" style="s2">groups and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">overall it&#39;s a hard thing when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.519" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">churchill said about democracy and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">founding fathers here said something</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">that democracy is the single worst form</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">of government ever created</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">saved for all the other forms what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.520" style="s2">meant is the idea of governance that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:19.439" style="s2">get a lot of different people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.520" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">actually participate together is just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.439" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">really hard proposition</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s why if you look at you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">human history until</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:28.400" style="s2">like the thing we call civilization only</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">started 10</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.400" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">10 13 000 years ago but we have 200</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">or 300 000 years of sapien existence of</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">people that were genetically and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.000" style="s2">neurologically similar to us</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">and those groups never got beyond give</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.000" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">or take what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">dunbar number 150 people in a tribe and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.120" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like why was that such a hard upper</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">bound why</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:51.280" style="s2">did for hundreds of thousands of years</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">humans never make groups bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.280" end="00:17:54.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.799" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">the simplest way i think of it is uh it</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">had to do with limits of coordination</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">so communication and coordination if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:06.000" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">has to make a decision that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.000" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">consequential to move or not or to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">change some deep aspect of how they do</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">up to about that size everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.320" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">in a tribal council and all have a say</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.320" end="00:18:19.600" style="s2">in what the rest of their life is going</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">to be subject to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.600" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">but as soon as you start getting more</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">people than that everyone can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">have a say because you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t have time to listen to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">thousand people right</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">it would take a month to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">on anything and no one</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">would even have the work memory to hold</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:40.840" style="s2">it and so then</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">i&#39;m have to rep pick representatives to</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.840" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">choices on my behalf now my life is</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">subject to choices</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:51.039" style="s2">that i don&#39;t have a say in no i&#39;d rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">cleave and make my own smaller group and</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.039" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">be more self-determined</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and so the denmark number was a limit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">how and up to that size i could talk to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:01.520" style="s2">everyone and get their sense made</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">things so i didn&#39;t just have it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.520" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">an anonymous the right or the left over</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">there that i could just have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">pejorative straw man version of i had</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">people that i knew intimately</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">so um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:18.640" style="s2">almost all of evolutionary history now</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">when the tribe would get as big as it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.640" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">could get then it would cleave and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">some of the people would move somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">else lots of migration happened until</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:26.160" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:27.840" style="s2">population keeps growing we&#39;ve migrated</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.160" end="00:19:29.760" style="s2">everywhere that we can now population</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.840" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">keeps growing and tribal warfare becomes</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.760" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">pressed right because now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">competing for scarce resource</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">now there&#39;s a basis to have tribes unify</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">against larger external tribes and we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">call that kind of the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">which means it was in a war game</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">theoretic kind of context</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:47.520" style="s2">and so now we unify together and try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">create government structures for these</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:49.760" style="s2">larger numbers of people because we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.760" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">and so there&#39;s binding energy to hold</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">the cleaving energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">associated with an enemy hypothesis um</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">so cajun</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">sure so when i think of coordination</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s still related to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">and and if if you want to take it</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">further maybe empathy</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:19.919" style="s2">right when when people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">a sense of each other or where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.919" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">or what the pain and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:26.240" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">people don&#39;t really care like you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.159" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">if you know i really care about</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:35.120" style="s2">daniel and you might be like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">should meet this person and that could</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.120" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">change my life</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">right you might you might give me 10</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">minutes you might give me an hour you</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">you might help but</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:46.080" style="s2">it feels like it starts that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">coordination starts with</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.080" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">some sort of connection um</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">yeah that came up for me so it&#39;s a nice</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">uh i mean there definitely needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">some fealty</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s a nice idea that it emerges</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:04.480" style="s2">from empathy it doesn&#39;t have to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:07.520" style="s2">from empathy it can emerge</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.480" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">from a shared enemy which it often does</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.520" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">and so then there&#39;s fealty to each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">not because we necessarily care about</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">each other but because we care about</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">ourselves and our sub</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">in group and we feel that we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.799" style="s2">bound with them against whoever the out</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">group is</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.799" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">but yeah the dunbar number was partly a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:24.240" style="s2">limit on</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">how many relationships i could deeply</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.240" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">track</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:29.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m willing to make certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">sacrifices of what i want most for</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.360" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">people i really know and love and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">known forever and i see every day and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">they know me</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">it&#39;s much harder to make sacrifices for</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:39.120" style="s2">anonymous people</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">that i have no idea who they are that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.120" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">are somewhere else right</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">and um so as you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">beyond that you have to have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">religion or patriotism or some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.200" style="s2">group identity that everyone gets to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.039" style="s2">part of so that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.200" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">i they identify with each other through</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.039" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">shared group identity</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">right we can see that in the us that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">broke down where there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">sense of what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:05.280" style="s2">u.s citizen that everyone&#39;s on the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">page with it really creates binding</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.280" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">energy there&#39;s much more of a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">what it means to be on the left or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:10.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">it has so much enmity towards each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.960" end="00:22:14.799" style="s2">that the thinking as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:16.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have something like shared</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.799" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">nationalism or patriotism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.480" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">part of the issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">i guess so fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.679" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">do we do humans just need</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">pain or an enemy need to really come</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:41.840" style="s2">in and coordinate in a in a larger way</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">involves whatever some kind of carbon</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.400" end="00:23:42.559" style="s2">tax or something that</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">um with superpowers that have nukes so</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">that the u.s and europe were to agree to</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">enforce them to because</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.480" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">does that what enforcement mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:17.760" style="s2">are we going to use that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">create war then does that just basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.760" end="00:24:22.000" style="s2">and that increased gdp and that be that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">they have relative to everyone else</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">like that&#39;s a very real set of theory of</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">considerations so your assessment of</p>

<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">and there&#39;s a particular proposition</p>

<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">through your kids get good jobs and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">environments</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">and vice versa so i have to pretend like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t arab kids getting good jobs you</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">have to pretend like you don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">about the environment because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">proposition is based on that theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:42.480" style="s2">of trade-offs and i&#39;ve now collapsed my</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">values into a strategy to achieve them</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.480" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">but if i said wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">i care about this you care about that is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">there a better proposition we can come</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">for what could achieve both both of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">so we separate the value from the</p>

<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">achieve it you can see that it almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">seems mind-boggling</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">it&#39;s bogglingly ridiculous that we have</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">democracy where you vote on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">proposition where you weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.120" style="s2">involved in crafting what is a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">proposition so some</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.120" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">special interest group that has a very</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">puts forward a proposition and markets</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.840" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">it to a group of people where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.080" style="s2">directly beneficial to them and this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">why almost every</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.080" end="00:32:23.120" style="s2">proposition gets about half the vote yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">and have to vote no</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.120" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">which also means that it inherently</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">polarizes the population which is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">why democracies die younger one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">main reasons</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.919" style="s2">is it&#39;s actually very hard to get lots</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">of people to coordinate it&#39;s very easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.919" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">to have one person rule or a small</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">number of people rule</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">and if you&#39;re creating a voting system</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">where the people</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">people aren&#39;t doing good proposition</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">creation first it is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">polarizing</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">because the thing that you&#39;re voting for</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.399" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">seems like it&#39;s actively trying to harm</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">what is meaningful and sacred to me and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:33:00.080" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:01.840" style="s2">since the beginning of the thing we call</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">almost everybody has lived in feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">or autocracy of some kind democracies</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">emerged just a few times in rare little</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:32.320" style="s2">with all of its flaws still a movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.320" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">in the direction of more participatory</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">any point they can take other people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">and you can see how profoundly broken</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">down that capacity and that value and</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:23.679" style="s2">perspective those people can have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">conversation that will end up</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.679" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">resulting in some ability for effective</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">movement forward but if the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.480" style="s2">sense-making conversation breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.480" end="00:34:38.560" style="s2">the basis that gave rise to the</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.560" end="00:34:42.560" style="s2">breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.679" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">and so we can see that in the u.s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.560" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">u.s came out of the european</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">get a good base understanding of reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.520" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">and the hegelian dialectic will always</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:04.480" style="s2">an antithesis and then a higher order</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">synthesis can we take multiple</p>

<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">that the underlying public education and</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:18.560" style="s2">for people to all be</p>

<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">and to know what&#39;s going on have went</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:26.320" style="s2">through enough institutional decay that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:28.079" style="s2">nobody really has a sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.320" end="00:35:29.599" style="s2">going on or to the degree they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">they&#39;re outraged and certain about</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.599" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">half the population thinks that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:37.839" style="s2">desperately wrong about right that</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">they&#39;re outraged and certain about</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.839" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">uh so we can look at this as the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">collapse of the american</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:45.359" style="s2">empire because you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">ability for a real republic because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.359" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">don&#39;t have participatory governments</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">because the prerequisites aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">so look at it in a bigger way which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">we can</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:56.560" style="s2">and this will then wrap up we can look</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:35:59.359" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.560" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">at the breakdown of the rope the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.359" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">ever globalized world order that has</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">been since world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.200" style="s2">because of course empires got larger as</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">time went on and there was a game</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.200" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">theoretic competition for more size</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.760" style="s2">british empire was not quite a world</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">ruling empire</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.760" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">um but after world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">it was the first time that we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">never have a war again between the major</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:23.359" style="s2">empires we</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">always had war between major empires but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.359" end="00:36:27.200" style="s2">they never had a nuke they never had</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">utterly catastrophic tech that made a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.200" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">war that no one</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">could win and so after world war</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">ii we had to do something unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">and say how do we</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">never have a war between the major</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">parties again and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">we said well we have to be so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">economically interdependent that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">never advantageous to bomb each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">it is better to coordinate with each</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:51.520" style="s2">other and so let&#39;s do globalization</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:52.880" style="s2">and have supply chains that interconnect</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">us in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.880" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t survive without import and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">export</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">well in a way that made sense right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">we had proxy wars but we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">major wars</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">from until now but it also created</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">one glo global civilization really</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">because none of the nations really can</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">operate on their own</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">a global civilization mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">globalism that is profoundly fragile</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">where breakdown you know a virus in one</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">part of the world can become a virus in</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">the entire world can start breaking</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">down supply chains breaking down social</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">fabric within countries between</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">and so covid was just a big enough thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">to show the systemic fragility</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">and the systemic fragility that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">cascading is really like the second and</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">third order effects are really</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">just starting to show up and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">continue for some time</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">and obviously when we look at the social</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">tension that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">that arose with george floyd it was a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">long-term issue</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">but after a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">unemployment of course there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">be more likelihood for violence in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:52.880" style="s2">street</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">when people&#39;s fundamental needs aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.880" end="00:37:58.720" style="s2">met you always get more</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">willingness for violence and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.720" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">even that was one of the secondary</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:04.720" style="s2">effects of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:06.640" style="s2">coveted type effects so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.720" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">experiencing right now also is that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">globalized world order</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:12.640" style="s2">that the kind of bretton woods</p>

<p begin="00:38:12.640" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">are breaking down or almost totally</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">decreased the u.n and the major empires</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">the the biggest countries in the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">are doing cyber attacks on each other</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">and espionage and they know it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:34.400" style="s2">following peacetime agreements it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:35.839" style="s2">basically unconventional war rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.400" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">conventional kinetic war</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.839" end="00:38:39.040" style="s2">but it can all right hang tight and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">conveniently getting uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">so we have a breakdown of the global</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">order and we have a breakdown of a</p>

<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">and uh leading the global order</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">and then we have a very big question of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.520" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">so what happens now uh wade davis do we</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">have together</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">increasing chaos facilitated by</p>

<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:30.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll share a couple thoughts on um</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.440" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">partly how i think we got here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">no means a uh comprehensive addressing</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">because i there&#39;s i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">actually quite a few threads that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">what makes someone particularly good in</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.760" end="00:53:47.920" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">and what makes them comprehensively</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.920" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">educated about history don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:52.880" style="s2">overlap all that well</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.480" style="s2">and doing very well in the market means</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.880" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">that you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.480" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">influence dc to have people do your</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:53:59.359" style="s2">bidding and</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.839" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">the people who are susceptible to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">that will do better and whatever so</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:03.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">other reasons but a couple reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.359" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">maybe are slightly less</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">often thought about and valuable one is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">uh i think the focus on in the types of</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">knowledge that mattered coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:20.000" style="s2">made a very drastic shift to stem focus</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">because of the critical role that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.000" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">technology played in the war</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:27.119" style="s2">and we can see that it was like we built</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.280" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">the entire manhattan project around</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.119" end="00:54:30.079" style="s2">oppenheimer and like a few people who</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:32.640" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.079" end="00:54:34.079" style="s2">really asymmetric technological and</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.640" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">physical insights</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.079" end="00:54:38.640" style="s2">and bletchley park around and you know a</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">couple major things around touring and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.640" end="00:54:41.280" style="s2">von neumann that pretty much determine</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">the war right like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.280" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">the bomb and the computer and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:52.160" style="s2">and then synthetic rub yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">a third example and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.160" end="00:54:56.799" style="s2">and sputnik uh getting there first i</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">think there was this very real sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.799" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">of and one way to look at world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:04.839" style="s2">was the competition between the us and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">the russians for the german scientists</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.839" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">um and not just you know so operation</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">paper clip here and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:12.400" style="s2">russian version of it there&#39;s the famous</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:13.359" style="s2">joke that who would win the cold war</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.400" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">the ussr and usa was who got the better</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:19.280" style="s2">nazi scientists um</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">but like it played a significant role</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.280" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:25.920" style="s2">i think there became a very heavy focus</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">and let&#39;s focus on stem but george</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.920" end="00:55:30.799" style="s2">washington</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">said it should be the primary aim of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.799" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.200" style="s2">government to train every single citizen</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.799" style="s2">in the science</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.200" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">of government and the science of</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.799" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">government meant history politics game</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.000" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:43.359" style="s2">courtier dynamics etc because if they</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.000" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.359" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">those who did would run everything and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:47.920" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be it would become a</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">kleptocracy and then an oligarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.920" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">some weird thing not a democracy</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">so i think the civics training became</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">very de-emphasized that&#39;s one part</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:56:02.240" style="s2">the other part i think is very important</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">is and this is so i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.240" end="00:56:05.280" style="s2">say something that i think is more</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">sympathetic with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.280" end="00:56:09.440" style="s2">anti-intellectual movement because i</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:10.160" style="s2">think the anti-intellectual movement was</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.440" end="00:56:12.359" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.160" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">game theoretic counter strategy to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.359" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">intellectualism used as a political</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:18.920" style="s2">weapon</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:20.960" style="s2">and things can be true that are not</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.920" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">representative of the whole truth right</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.960" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">one of the things i see all the time is</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">people say well obviously</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">herbs and supplements and peptides don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:30.880" style="s2">really work that well because there</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:31.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t that many phase three clinical</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">trials showing</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.839" end="00:56:35.680" style="s2">that they work and there are four pharma</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">meds well there&#39;s no money</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.680" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">because there&#39;s no patentability on any</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">of those things</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:41.680" style="s2">of course they&#39;ll never get phase three</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">trials and the phase three trials that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.680" end="00:56:44.480" style="s2">showed that premarin worked or vioxx</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">work didn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t kill</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.480" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">massive numbers of people because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:49.440" style="s2">included in the scope of the safety</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.440" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">and so it&#39;s true those pastry clinical</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:55.440" style="s2">trials are true</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">and if you are literate you understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.440" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">they&#39;re true but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">representative right because</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">if here&#39;s the whole space of possible</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.079" end="00:57:02.720" style="s2">health interventions</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">the ones that are profitable will get</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.720" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">the most research and they represent</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:07.920" style="s2">this space so you then the preponderance</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">of data is an uneven distribution</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">right so similarly i can put an ipcc</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.880" end="00:57:14.400" style="s2">together and say</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:15.680" style="s2">all of the stuff on climate change but</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.400" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t rep but</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.680" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">dc is still running the benign china</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:20.799" style="s2">hypothesis and not looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">particular issue seriously</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.799" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">bannon was actually a big part of you</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">know and trump delivering the us from</p>

<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:31.119" style="s2">china hypothesis so there was a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">that i see that throughout history</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.119" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">whenever</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">something becomes a source of legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:38.720" style="s2">authority whether</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">it&#39;s the church or academia then</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.720" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">there&#39;s so much power in being the one</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">who said says what is true</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">that then anyone who&#39;s very good at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">game of power has a maximum incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">try to capture</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">and influence that legitimate authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">so the legitimate authority starts</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.040" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">getting influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">who&#39;s funding it and how the prestige</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">networks work and those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">so then legitimate authority in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">started to have a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">political biases that a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">the us didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:12.079" style="s2">represented their interests well and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">but they couldn&#39;t argue against the ipcc</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.079" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">thing well</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:15.799" style="s2">but they could feel like it was not</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">aligned with their interests so</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.799" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">anti-intellectualism since they couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:20.400" style="s2">compete at it was actually their counter</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:22.240" style="s2">weapon i just won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.400" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">engage with the weapons that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">and so one of the ways i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2">to actually have sense making really be</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">able to be pervasive</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ve also of course seen firsthand</p>

<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">what has happened to tibet and there</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:29.839" style="s2">seems to be this thing as</p>

<p begin="01:00:29.839" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">you know there&#39;s build stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">that somehow it&#39;s okay and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:36.240" style="s2">not you know and that gets back in this</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:38.000" style="s2">whole thing where genocide is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.240" end="01:00:39.599" style="s2">universally condemned but ethnicity the</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.599" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">is not only not condemned is considered</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:49.920" style="s2">in in many quarters so what is the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">what is your sense of china in the next</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.920" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">century</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:57.839" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s such a critical question um</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:04.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t claim to know what&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.760" end="01:01:07.359" style="s2">xi ji ping&#39;s mind or what the internal</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.160" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">plans and sense making of the ccp are</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.359" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">and nor do i represent that whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:16.000" style="s2">are represents the actual will of all</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">the chinese people outside of beijing</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.000" end="01:01:20.559" style="s2">um which it obviously doesn&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">let me just sort of interrupt daniel but</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.559" end="01:01:25.040" style="s2">you&#39;re so right in that i mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:27.200" style="s2">there is a terrible tendency in the west</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.040" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">to see china as this monolith</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.200" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">when in fact of course it&#39;s remarkably</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">diverse ethnically</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">uh vast country vast numbers of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:37.839" style="s2">vast</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:38.319" style="s2">orientations and so on i&#39;m sorry go</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.839" end="01:01:40.079" style="s2">ahead</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.319" end="01:01:41.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to say that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.079" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.920" end="01:01:46.720" style="s2">people who have a xenophobic racist</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.720" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">just because it seems big and scary and</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">they don&#39;t like the big scary things so</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">they make it the chinese monolith of</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">course there is some reactive</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">non-thinking part of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say that that is much dumber</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:01.520" style="s2">than the benign china the hypothesis was</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:03.680" style="s2">i would say those are kind of equally</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">not clear assessments</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.680" end="01:02:08.400" style="s2">um i think the hundred year marathon is</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">a particularly interesting book around</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.400" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">china&#39;s long-term plan starting in give</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">or take 1949 and it is kind of tracking</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">quite well</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">uh i i think</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.880" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">i think we&#39;ve had a period where nobody</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.920" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">remembers in their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">lived experience very serious war</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:31.359" style="s2">in the developed world and so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:33.119" style="s2">really have any embodied sense that</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.359" end="01:02:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s even a thing so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.119" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">their actual sense of history is quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.440" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">bad right like their embodied sense is</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">quite bad</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:43.599" style="s2">and so they they don&#39;t recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">like slavery and</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.599" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">genocide and initiating war and empire</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">has been kind of the story</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.119" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">for the whole history of civilization</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">everybody like it&#39;s not just been</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:56.160" style="s2">european white slavery it was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">you know the ottomans and turks</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.160" end="01:02:58.799" style="s2">enslaving europeans it was people in</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">asia</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.799" end="01:03:04.799" style="s2">in slavery inter asian slavery it was uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">you know command command g violence with</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.799" end="01:03:08.720" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:10.480" style="s2">first tribes people like largely humans</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.720" end="01:03:11.920" style="s2">have just been kind of violent for</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.480" end="01:03:13.680" style="s2">a long time</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.920" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">often and that&#39;s an important part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.680" end="01:03:16.480" style="s2">the story so when we say the us was</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">built on</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.480" end="01:03:20.079" style="s2">genocide and slavery and how can it have</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">any kind of moral value</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.079" end="01:03:24.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a very real story and like what</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">do we do for reparations on genocide and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.079" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">slavery</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:31.039" style="s2">and the whole world was in a context</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">of slavery and genocide arguably you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.039" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">could say british colonialism was less</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.440" end="01:03:35.839" style="s2">violent than dutch or</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">spanish or some of the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.839" end="01:03:38.079" style="s2">colonialisms you go to the congo and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:40.480" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.079" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">in some ways so this is why the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.480" end="01:03:43.920" style="s2">historical context is important and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:45.200" style="s2">then i&#39;m going to think of china in</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.920" end="01:03:48.720" style="s2">light of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.200" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">if i put myself in my imagining of xi&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.720" end="01:03:52.079" style="s2">position i&#39;m actually quite empathetic</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:53.839" style="s2">to everything he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.079" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">and in some ways i can say it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.839" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">smartest thing anyone in the world is</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">doing because there are some critical</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">problems that it appears he&#39;s paying</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">attention to that no one</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">else is even paying earnest attention to</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">so i&#39;m very empathetic to the solutions</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:08.160" style="s2">he has that doesn&#39;t mean i like the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">solutions or want them to happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.160" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">so just to kind of briefly frame that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.760" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">rule of law requires monopoly of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:16.480" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:18.400" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have a monopoly of violence</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.480" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">how do you enforce this rule of law</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.400" end="01:04:21.920" style="s2">if we say you can&#39;t cut down the parks</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:23.359" style="s2">but the dudes who are cutting down the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.920" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">trees have bigger guns than the police</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.359" end="01:04:27.440" style="s2">do then you can cut down the parks right</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">well how do you have monopoly of</p>
