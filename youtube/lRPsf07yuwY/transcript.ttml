<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.720" style="s2">because ever since ancient Egypt we had</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.270" end="00:00:50.250" style="s2">mmm and we also should watch out before</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">we look for a fire to watch out for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.250" end="00:00:54.449" style="s2">fake phalluses and they&#39;re always the</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.969" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">shadows inside of us and they do so by</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">oh yeah the scapegoat again or the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:05.510" style="s2">object</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.710" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">ranae&#39;s yards writes extensively about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:14.340" style="s2">this you look Restivo right successfully</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">about this one of the great achievements</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.340" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">of European 20th century philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">the understanding of scapegoating and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:24.930" style="s2">how fundamental it is to human identity</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">but so let&#39;s let&#39;s pause there because</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.930" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">that&#39;s very very important right so yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:32.040" style="s2">phallus you&#39;re talking about okay is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">danger of it is when it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.040" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">mechanism for scapegoating you know yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">and and that and that&#39;s the danger so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">that&#39;s what we have to avoid and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">how we can understand what a healthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">fellows exactly she would be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">and this is where we&#39;re not really sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:51.630" style="s2">art comes into the picture who was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">French philosophers very influential in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.630" end="00:01:55.500" style="s2">America and I think because here art</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">said that scapegoating is the only way</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.500" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">we can unify that&#39;s how we always unify</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">people then of course then you assume</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:05.310" style="s2">that all utopian visions are bad and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">dangerous and must be avoided but that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.310" end="00:02:10.229" style="s2">is just an intellectual disqualification</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">that&#39;s not sorry not permitted you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.229" end="00:02:13.860" style="s2">you got to go back and retry everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">even if you fail the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.860" end="00:02:17.310" style="s2">sometimes before because you got to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:18.870" style="s2">at every option you got to turn every</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:22.320" style="s2">stone you otherwise you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.870" end="00:02:24.630" style="s2">philosopher so you go back and study it</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.320" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">and see what did go wrong and why and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.630" end="00:02:28.050" style="s2">then you discover that we also have</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:29.160" style="s2">beautiful phallic missions that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.050" end="00:02:30.810" style="s2">actually have been accomplished in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.160" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">history because they have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.810" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">accomplished that were successful</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:36.000" style="s2">phallus is concerned exist and they can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.960" end="00:02:38.040" style="s2">save humanity if you like and so for</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.000" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">example declaration so roster did this</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.040" end="00:02:42.000" style="s2">or asterism three thousand seven years</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:44.520" style="s2">ago kick-started a religion that we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.000" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">use today three thousand seven hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.520" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">years later and say that wait a second</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">it is genuinely the phallic visions that</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:52.650" style="s2">have changed humanity for the better</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:55.470" style="s2">throughout history and every time we got</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.650" end="00:02:57.390" style="s2">stuck and needed saving it was final</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.470" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">equations that did that mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.390" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">so give me some examples of historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:06.840" style="s2">examples okay you can understand first</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:09.060" style="s2">of all but this is from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.840" end="00:03:09.959" style="s2">of the people who leave one territory to</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.060" end="00:03:14.730" style="s2">go into the next one</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.959" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">mm-hmm I mean hey when the Hebrews</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.730" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">arrived in the promised land they</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">committed genocide so you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">understand that it&#39;s depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:27.330" style="s2">circumstances what was available to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">it might not necessarily look good for</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.330" end="00:03:31.049" style="s2">everybody in Universal Manor</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:33.660" style="s2">of course we hope that with the machines</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.049" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">we can do it more smoothly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.660" end="00:03:38.670" style="s2">less bloody but you know at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:41.130" style="s2">the day say for example Columbus</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.670" end="00:03:44.280" style="s2">conquering America put Europe into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.130" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">golden age then somebody produce a well</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.280" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">look at the Native Americans and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.350" style="s2">badly they were traded and they got sick</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.220" style="s2">from smallpox and everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.350" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">what that&#39;s absolutely true but from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.220" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">perspective of European culture you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:58.739" style="s2">cannot deny the fact that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:04:00.630" style="s2">prospered conquered three continents and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.739" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">became the wealthiest part of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.630" end="00:04:04.980" style="s2">and eventually the really messianic part</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:07.110" style="s2">of that was of course in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.980" end="00:04:08.910" style="s2">century when building the ride is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.110" end="00:04:11.310" style="s2">ideal in Germany and Scandinavia and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:13.799" style="s2">people realized that if everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.310" end="00:04:16.019" style="s2">read and write and count in a society if</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.799" end="00:04:19.410" style="s2">everybody gets schooling we&#39;ll all be</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.019" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">better off that is the genuine messianic</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.410" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">the Messianic is the trick with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:27.480" style="s2">Messianic is that if somebody finds out</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">a game that everybody benefits from</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.480" end="00:04:31.980" style="s2">and where the overall cost benefit</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:34.770" style="s2">analysis is just enormous benefit</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.980" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">compared to the cost involved so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.770" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">often when the Messianic appears but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:41.190" style="s2">want to go I want to go a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:43.200" style="s2">back because your examples again they</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.190" end="00:04:44.550" style="s2">were there&#39;s always a scapegoat involved</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.200" end="00:04:48.120" style="s2">all right there was I just finished</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">reading George book sorry yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.120" end="00:04:52.590" style="s2">know when Columbus went to America the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:55.110" style="s2">scapegoat might be the the Savage or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.590" end="00:04:58.500" style="s2">know or when you know the Jews went went</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.110" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">no no no no no there was no there was no</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.500" end="00:05:03.780" style="s2">scapegoat involved I mean people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:05.670" style="s2">America were treated horribly no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.780" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">about that but there wasn&#39;t scapegoating</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.670" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">involved Columbus did not go back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">your percent I need to raise bigger</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:14.100" style="s2">funds so that we can kill the awful</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:15.900" style="s2">savages of America no he went back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.100" end="00:05:17.820" style="s2">said I plundered them I&#39;ve taken their</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.900" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">gold away from them and I can get you</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.820" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">more gold if you give you more money two</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:23.580" style="s2">more boats okay fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">that&#39;s not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.580" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">scapegoating that difference is very</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">very important to make that distinction</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:35.400" style="s2">so at the end of the day of its often</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">after military victories say Napoleon</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.400" end="00:05:41.190" style="s2">yeah you wander Europe you know but even</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:43.920" style="s2">in 1807 at the forward of her monologist</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.190" end="00:05:47.040" style="s2">spirit legal rights to the German people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.920" end="00:05:48.570" style="s2">I know that Napoleon plundered us last</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.040" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">year I know he raped all our daughters</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.570" end="00:05:53.550" style="s2">killed all our sons literally just that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:05:55.350" style="s2">yeah and then Olin was typically it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.550" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">the apocalypse it was typical German</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.350" end="00:06:00.420" style="s2">he&#39;s totally torn apart I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:03.990" style="s2">right say go Napoleon is the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.420" end="00:06:06.300" style="s2">he is the shit he is the time spirit he</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.990" end="00:06:08.250" style="s2">is the new thing all we Germans need to</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:43.260" style="s2">important thing there is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.640" end="00:13:46.470" style="s2">the difference between public teaching</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.260" end="00:13:48.810" style="s2">and mysticism so what can be said in</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.470" end="00:13:52.050" style="s2">public and what cannot be said in public</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.810" end="00:13:54.750" style="s2">hmm because what what you can&#39;t say in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.050" end="00:13:57.450" style="s2">pop you can&#39;t say something in public</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.750" end="00:14:01.110" style="s2">that people are bound to misunderstand</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.450" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">yeah academia is all about publishing</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.110" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">everything in public that&#39;s more words</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.529" end="00:14:13.440" style="s2">yes exactly you got it so in new</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.250" end="00:14:16.260" style="s2">exoteric in the new esoteric have to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.440" end="00:14:17.790" style="s2">defined and this is problematic because</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.260" end="00:14:19.920" style="s2">you&#39;re used to the fact that if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.790" end="00:14:21.649" style="s2">close the door to room and some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.920" end="00:14:24.089" style="s2">sit inside the room and they&#39;re powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.649" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">then they create a little power click</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.089" end="00:14:27.540" style="s2">and you want to send journalists and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:29.400" style="s2">want to send reporters in there and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.540" end="00:14:31.230" style="s2">discover what they&#39;re doing and expose</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.400" end="00:14:33.209" style="s2">it and all those things and because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.230" end="00:14:35.790" style="s2">live in the first stage of digital which</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.209" end="00:14:38.520" style="s2">is all about transparency or rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.790" end="00:14:40.200" style="s2">because everything will be memorized you</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.520" end="00:14:43.500" style="s2">might as well go public with it from day</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.200" end="00:14:46.470" style="s2">one now we need a dialectical reaction</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.500" end="00:14:46.860" style="s2">against that although it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.470" end="00:14:49.709" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.860" end="00:14:51.270" style="s2">and the question is this if you go into</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.709" end="00:14:53.790" style="s2">room with some people that you deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.270" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">trust how the fuck do you keep the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.790" end="00:15:00.060" style="s2">smartphone&#39;s out of there you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:02.130" style="s2">hmm that is key here itself to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.060" end="00:15:04.529" style="s2">strip-search somebody at the door every</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.130" end="00:15:08.190" style="s2">time and even then they probably implant</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.529" end="00:15:11.970" style="s2">something in the future or I would say</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.190" end="00:15:15.180" style="s2">this where could you train the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.970" end="00:15:16.529" style="s2">to be mystical and esoteric and keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.180" end="00:15:17.940" style="s2">knowledge to yourself because of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.529" end="00:15:20.550" style="s2">misunderstood if it goes public</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.940" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">well former can I share an interest I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.550" end="00:15:25.350" style="s2">think Peter said those two is called</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.720" end="00:15:27.480" style="s2">psychedelics okay psychedelics this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.350" end="00:15:30.690" style="s2">far as I know illegal in all Western</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.480" end="00:15:33.390" style="s2">countries yeah he generally legal uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.690" end="00:15:35.730" style="s2">what&#39;s good about getting involved with</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.390" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">something that he&#39;s illegal personally I</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.730" end="00:15:41.010" style="s2">I only take drugs in Peru or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:43.260" style="s2">uh what you trained yourself in being a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.010" end="00:15:44.670" style="s2">satiric you can&#39;t talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.260" end="00:15:46.500" style="s2">public because if you talk about it in</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.670" end="00:15:49.440" style="s2">public then the police needs to rest you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.500" end="00:15:51.990" style="s2">said you did you know you just locked up</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.440" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">so you trained yourself and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.990" end="00:15:55.110" style="s2">quiet about something other people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:57.029" style="s2">train with this are for example people</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.110" end="00:15:59.250" style="s2">who work within the opposition in China</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.029" end="00:16:02.430" style="s2">and Iran China and Iran are currently</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.250" end="00:16:03.870" style="s2">dictatorships one of them is Shia Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.430" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">leadership the other one is a communist</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.870" end="00:16:07.380" style="s2">dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:09.240" style="s2">these two dictatorships China and Iran</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.380" end="00:16:11.339" style="s2">if you live within those cultures you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.240" end="00:16:13.110" style="s2">trained in being esoteric all the time</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.339" end="00:16:15.990" style="s2">there&#39;s tons and things you must not</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.110" end="00:16:19.829" style="s2">talk about or you can talk about them in</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.990" end="00:16:22.589" style="s2">an encrypted fashion mm-hmm then you get</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.829" end="00:16:23.880" style="s2">close to the hackers the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.589" end="00:16:27.449" style="s2">interesting people out there at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.880" end="00:16:32.060" style="s2">moment the hackers are they are the army</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.449" end="00:16:35.940" style="s2">of the next Moses in error mmm okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.060" end="00:16:38.190" style="s2">when hackers start a go spiritual not</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.940" end="00:16:40.319" style="s2">not and the sexy middle-class people</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.190" end="00:16:42.810" style="s2">remember with the hackers started no</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.319" end="00:16:46.260" style="s2">spiritual really interesting shit is</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.810" end="00:16:49.380" style="s2">going to happen then you get into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.260" end="00:16:50.880" style="s2">mysticism that we need today and well I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.380" end="00:16:53.329" style="s2">didn&#39;t write about this at all in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.880" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">synthesis of book because the mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.329" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">it was sort of it&#39;s sort of in between</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">the lines right but I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">ideal the idea we need to explore</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">because what is lacking next echo</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:06.689" style="s2">tokenism and cosmopolitanism it&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:09.809" style="s2">of deep religion understanding of deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.689" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">religion mhm mhm and and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.809" end="00:17:15.059" style="s2">really you&#39;re being told this because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:16.829" style="s2">trust you will you being told this</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.059" end="00:17:20.100" style="s2">because you&#39;re also part of developing</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.829" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">it further mm-hmm okay but you cannot go</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.100" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">public with this because if you go</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:24.839" style="s2">public with this it will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.339" end="00:17:28.919" style="s2">misunderstood and all hell will break</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.839" end="00:17:30.299" style="s2">loose yeah well yeah and I&#39;m involved in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.919" end="00:17:33.419" style="s2">certain things like this at which I</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.299" end="00:17:36.960" style="s2">absolutely certain could not be public</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.150" end="00:17:47.940" style="s2">understood so instead of looking for</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.350" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">these people who pride themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.940" end="00:17:50.680" style="s2">being transparent everybody</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.470" end="00:18:04.120" style="s2">according to law I must even keep quiet</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.900" end="00:18:06.340" style="s2">about them trying to commit suicide</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.120" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">the only profession well you&#39;re not even</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.280" end="00:18:16.330" style="s2">of course you&#39;re trained in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.920" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">quiet about things if you work within</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.330" end="00:18:20.410" style="s2">the company that works at patents and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:22.300" style="s2">most companies do today so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.410" end="00:18:24.280" style="s2">trade secret you better keep quiet about</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.300" end="00:18:26.290" style="s2">it so but this is getting increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.280" end="00:18:28.090" style="s2">hard in a society of the pressure is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.290" end="00:18:30.100" style="s2">being pushed if everything was</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.090" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">transparent and we knew everything about</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.100" end="00:18:33.580" style="s2">everybody then the world would be better</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:10.509" style="s2">have to make new institutions and well</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.629" end="00:23:12.820" style="s2">you gotta wait until somebody comes</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.429" end="00:23:30.399" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting like that&#39;s like the</p>

<p begin="00:23:30.399" end="00:23:33.549" style="s2">kind of a messiah comes with like</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.080" end="00:23:35.139" style="s2">there&#39;s not been that many great</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.549" end="00:23:36.789" style="s2">philosophers in the world right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.139" end="00:23:39.249" style="s2">only a few right and they always change</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.900" end="00:24:45.779" style="s2">engineering and are very successful at</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.460" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">it now and they&#39;re in their early</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.779" end="00:24:51.029" style="s2">thirties are discovering I have more the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">priest the archetype person another guy</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.029" end="00:24:56.370" style="s2">in the room goes yeah but I have more</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:58.890" style="s2">the chief tamely you know I teach</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.370" end="00:25:00.330" style="s2">engineers and managers you know so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.890" end="00:25:02.190" style="s2">engineers are more likely in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.330" end="00:25:07.230" style="s2">priestly caste and the managers are more</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.190" end="00:25:08.909" style="s2">like the I&#39;m teaching nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.230" end="00:25:10.590" style="s2">digital transformation leadership from</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.909" end="00:25:13.220" style="s2">next year you know that&#39;s all I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.590" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">teaching that was kind of it so and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.220" end="00:25:18.539" style="s2">this is very interesting because then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:21.230" style="s2">get an idea of engineering yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.539" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">goes into GPS or what is engineering</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.230" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">where did you start from and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.450" style="s2">that&#39;s good question yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:29.309" style="s2">disasters in history like the Tower of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.450" end="00:25:31.860" style="s2">Babel could the Tower of Babel be built</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.309" end="00:25:33.779" style="s2">today and no longer be disaster that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.860" end="00:25:35.610" style="s2">question that&#39;s interesting to ask why</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.779" end="00:25:38.640" style="s2">did we go to the moon who came up with</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.610" end="00:25:41.549" style="s2">that idea you know it you know these</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:44.190" style="s2">feats for good or bad need to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.549" end="00:25:45.630" style="s2">redefined and revisited and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.190" end="00:25:47.549" style="s2">young engineers are incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.630" end="00:25:49.230" style="s2">interested in and once you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.549" end="00:25:51.480" style="s2">bunch of engineer standing at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.230" end="00:25:54.570" style="s2">their toes in the room you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.480" end="00:25:56.100" style="s2">talking about the phallic and then you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.570" end="00:25:57.899" style="s2">and are working in a territory where</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.100" end="00:26:00.179" style="s2">currently the spiritual discourse or</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.899" end="00:26:03.179" style="s2">North America isn&#39;t even close to so II</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.179" end="00:26:06.179" style="s2">I find it complimentary the kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.179" end="00:26:08.029" style="s2">with you I think both projects need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.179" end="00:26:11.940" style="s2">be respected I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.029" end="00:26:13.110" style="s2">tremendous value out of a dialog coming</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.940" end="00:26:15.149" style="s2">out of this I hope to have it the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.110" end="00:26:16.649" style="s2">Ferranti for example I think this</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.149" end="00:26:18.390" style="s2">tremendous about dialogue coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.649" end="00:26:20.100" style="s2">this and if you&#39;re and pedis understands</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.390" end="00:26:22.470" style="s2">it comes out of it so roster next to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:24.090" style="s2">that even better because you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.470" end="00:26:25.830" style="s2">talking about is the ID or the jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.090" end="00:26:27.809" style="s2">penis and the so Rastan and John from</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.830" end="00:26:29.460" style="s2">arc of the Buddhist in a dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.809" end="00:26:30.659" style="s2">each other so it&#39;s a sore ass some of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.460" end="00:26:32.340" style="s2">the buddhist goes in dollar with each</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.659" end="00:26:33.870" style="s2">other if the phallic and the magical</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.340" end="00:26:36.270" style="s2">going to dialogue with each other we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.870" end="00:26:38.340" style="s2">both talk about the new grand narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.270" end="00:26:38.940" style="s2">that&#39;s needed and we could also talk</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.340" end="00:26:41.010" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.940" end="00:26:44.100" style="s2">Tayna within which that narrative must</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.010" end="00:26:45.690" style="s2">arrive okay that&#39;s that&#39;s nice that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.100" end="00:26:49.230" style="s2">nice picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.690" end="00:26:51.300" style="s2">oh very Aristotelian but question for</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.230" end="00:26:52.680" style="s2">you yeah I got a question for you and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.300" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">often you&#39;re talking about the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.680" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">and young men being young women these</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:06.900" style="s2">days they have to do know young women</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:08.880" style="s2">young women will certainly feel a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.900" end="00:27:12.050" style="s2">attraction to this whole sort of Western</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.880" end="00:27:14.070" style="s2">Buddhist approach spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.050" end="00:27:15.930" style="s2">complexity is something they understand</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.070" end="00:27:16.650" style="s2">by nature that&#39;s a bunny to Royce a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.930" end="00:27:18.420" style="s2">woman okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.650" end="00:27:19.770" style="s2">many the many women in the field of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.420" end="00:27:21.480" style="s2">complexity science and they do great</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.770" end="00:27:23.160" style="s2">work no I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.480" end="00:27:24.660" style="s2">problem women at all and also women are</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.160" end="00:27:27.300" style="s2">way more socially intelligent than men</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.660" end="00:27:28.980" style="s2">are by nature so the average young woman</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.300" end="00:27:32.270" style="s2">today has four times as many Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.980" end="00:27:35.340" style="s2">friends as the average young man so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.270" end="00:27:38.700" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about that which others take</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.340" end="00:27:41.010" style="s2">care of so ironically Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.700" end="00:27:43.290" style="s2">has put the foot on something which he</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.010" end="00:27:46.050" style="s2">hasn&#39;t fulfilled which is the need for</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.290" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">final ignition because that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.050" end="00:27:50.040" style="s2">explosive behind Jordan Peters and all</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">these other voices have stepped forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.040" end="00:27:54.390" style="s2">but they&#39;re all talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:57.330" style="s2">magical here or feminine they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.390" end="00:27:59.130" style="s2">about the container and little that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.330" end="00:28:01.680" style="s2">way that&#39;s the self-organizing thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.130" end="00:28:03.830" style="s2">that works by itself whereas the male is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.680" end="00:28:06.120" style="s2">something that needs to be developed</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.830" end="00:28:10.500" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s men&#39;s groups and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.120" end="00:28:12.390" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why so many cultures</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.500" end="00:28:13.950" style="s2">circumcise their boys is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.390" end="00:28:16.050" style="s2">reminding the boys every time you look</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.950" end="00:28:17.760" style="s2">down your foreskins gone you&#39;re reminded</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.050" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">that this first kid was taken away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.760" end="00:28:22.650" style="s2">you you&#39;re a kid because in your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:24.840" style="s2">nature as you are you&#39;re dangerous but</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.650" end="00:28:27.150" style="s2">when you&#39;re cultured and trained and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.840" end="00:28:28.800" style="s2">domesticated you&#39;ll be wonderful it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.150" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">the understanding that the shift from</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.800" end="00:28:34.740" style="s2">nature of the culture the containment of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:36.840" style="s2">sexuality the control of sexuality so</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.740" end="00:28:39.780" style="s2">that is directed in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.840" end="00:28:42.960" style="s2">makes all the difference this is what</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.780" end="00:28:44.850" style="s2">growing up is all about this is why we</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.960" end="00:28:49.290" style="s2">have the three stages of the child of</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.850" end="00:28:51.240" style="s2">the adult and of the God so if the child</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.290" end="00:28:52.710" style="s2">aspires to be the God all hell breaks</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.240" end="00:28:54.659" style="s2">loose if the child</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.710" end="00:28:57.090" style="s2">to imitate to one day become a grown-up</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.659" end="00:28:59.340" style="s2">go through proper rite of passage the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.090" end="00:29:01.590" style="s2">learns is still young or she&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.340" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">young need to learn more but you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.590" end="00:29:05.340" style="s2">respected as a grown-up because you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">support yourself then you come into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.340" end="00:29:09.539" style="s2">mode where you can even be a parent you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:11.220" style="s2">can contribute to the larger community</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.539" end="00:29:13.169" style="s2">you create value that&#39;s way more than</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.220" end="00:29:15.390" style="s2">you need for yourself you create an</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.169" end="00:29:17.700" style="s2">abundance of value of some kind then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.390" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">really truly a grown-up then you shine</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.700" end="00:29:20.820" style="s2">and you have the years where you shine</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.350" style="s2">and then eventually you become an older</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.820" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">person who needs the support of others</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.350" end="00:29:28.049" style="s2">again materially but you supply the</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.260" end="00:29:43.730" style="s2">and a god or a girl a woman or a goddess</p>

<p begin="00:30:43.860" end="00:30:48.299" style="s2">civilization but we still have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.679" end="00:30:52.500" style="s2">understand ourselves as no matter</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.299" end="00:30:54.270" style="s2">logical and this is where I take social</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.500" end="00:30:56.130" style="s2">philosophy into the realm of process</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.270" end="00:30:57.659" style="s2">philosophy the other end will process</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.130" end="00:30:59.789" style="s2">philosophy is exploding at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.659" end="00:31:01.230" style="s2">of physics and that&#39;s because physics is</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.789" end="00:31:03.510" style="s2">now moving into loop quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.230" end="00:31:05.520" style="s2">it&#39;s moving into the holographic</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.510" end="00:31:06.570" style="s2">principle and if you study physics in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.520" end="00:31:08.490" style="s2">the holographic principle</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.570" end="00:31:10.769" style="s2">discover that&#39;s just process philosophy</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.769" end="00:31:14.759" style="s2">environment I&#39;m doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.899" end="00:31:17.279" style="s2">with the social environment I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.759" end="00:31:18.929" style="s2">process philosophy into social and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.279" end="00:31:21.149" style="s2">I&#39;m discovering and then is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.929" end="00:31:22.769" style="s2">understand social completely and how</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.149" end="00:31:24.330" style="s2">human beings relate to each other we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.769" end="00:31:31.980" style="s2">need to go back to the original nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.330" end="00:31:34.679" style="s2">tribe this saucy on the sauce hunt or</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.980" end="00:31:36.269" style="s2">sociology is the study of what the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.679" end="00:31:38.250" style="s2">original tribe might have looked like</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.269" end="00:31:40.200" style="s2">yeah the tribe that we lived in for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.250" end="00:31:42.529" style="s2">longest possible times it shaped our</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.200" end="00:31:46.470" style="s2">genetic makeup more than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.529" end="00:31:48.929" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s it so it&#39;s all it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.470" end="00:31:51.899" style="s2">the arrow goes to both ways it goes</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.929" end="00:31:55.289" style="s2">forward the future vision is by going as</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.899" end="00:31:57.059" style="s2">far back as possible you know yeah but a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.289" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">lot of guys these days start with</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.059" end="00:32:00.179" style="s2">talking about the Big Bang and they make</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:01.799" style="s2">a powerful presentation about the Big</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.179" end="00:32:04.440" style="s2">Bang that didn&#39;t even happen by the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.799" end="00:32:05.370" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s not interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.440" end="00:32:06.899" style="s2">us as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.370" end="00:32:10.110" style="s2">but the interest as human beings is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.899" end="00:32:11.940" style="s2">beginning of life yeah whenever that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.110" end="00:32:15.269" style="s2">happened first on this planet and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.940" end="00:32:17.909" style="s2">story of the origin of life is a human</p>

<p begin="00:32:17.909" end="00:32:22.830" style="s2">try to create it and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.070" end="00:32:25.799" style="s2">origin of life is the story that needs</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.830" end="00:32:28.769" style="s2">to be retold and deepened to then</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.799" end="00:32:31.470" style="s2">understand echo topia whereas the story</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.769" end="00:32:33.750" style="s2">of the cosmic pole is the store of human</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.470" end="00:32:35.970" style="s2">beings settle down and start to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.750" end="00:32:38.519" style="s2">nomadic in their minds yeah and their</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.970" end="00:32:40.860" style="s2">ideas traveled and their ideas were on</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.519" end="00:32:42.899" style="s2">the move and that movement will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.860" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">accomplished with establishments of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.899" end="00:32:48.990" style="s2">cost of all these two major products in</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.990" end="00:32:53.879" style="s2">becomes the difference between esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.179" end="00:32:56.190" style="s2">and exoteric and where you put what do I</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.879" end="00:32:58.889" style="s2">keep my mouth shut about what do I tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.190" end="00:33:01.259" style="s2">people in public becomes a value you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.889" end="00:33:06.509" style="s2">have to make depending on the overall</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.259" end="00:33:15.580" style="s2">goal now you started thinking utopianism</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.509" end="00:33:17.770" style="s2">probably they didn&#39;t so unless</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.580" end="00:33:20.850" style="s2">guys out there don&#39;t evolve sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.770" end="00:33:23.470" style="s2">what they say they&#39;re faking it</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.850" end="00:33:26.020" style="s2">okay don&#39;t trust anybody doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.470" end="00:33:27.700" style="s2">functioning sex life to begin with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.020" end="00:33:30.070" style="s2">can&#39;t do philosophy without sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.700" end="00:33:31.750" style="s2">you can&#39;t you got to get your own dick</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.070" end="00:33:34.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t pussy into it you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.750" end="00:33:37.060" style="s2">just you can&#39;t do art without it just</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.050" end="00:33:38.890" style="s2">banal so what do you think philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.060" end="00:33:40.990" style="s2">will be anything but by now if people</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.890" end="00:33:42.910" style="s2">pretended this was some kind of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.990" end="00:33:44.860" style="s2">we have in salons with our clothes on</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.910" end="00:33:47.140" style="s2">and sexuality doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.860" end="00:33:50.050" style="s2">it becomes infant talk because of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.140" end="00:33:52.150" style="s2">unless there&#39;s a deep understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.050" end="00:33:53.710" style="s2">a deep involvement that sexuality into</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.150" end="00:33:55.510" style="s2">the world of philosophy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.710" end="00:33:57.730" style="s2">philosophy proper then you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.510" end="00:34:00.040" style="s2">really understood what Nietzsche meant</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.860" end="00:34:38.020" style="s2">of something so the tariff occasional</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.650" end="00:34:39.970" style="s2">sexuality that is so predominant in</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.970" end="00:34:44.080" style="s2">it just comes back and bites you in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.190" end="00:34:47.410" style="s2">ass because if you try to do philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.080" end="00:34:48.820" style="s2">or even metaphysics without sexuality</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.410" end="00:34:50.440" style="s2">you&#39;re just a little boy or a little</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:56.530" style="s2">the Freudian revolution means that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.070" end="00:34:58.270" style="s2">can do philosophy without sexuality as</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.530" end="00:35:01.350" style="s2">longer at least accordingly and and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.270" end="00:35:04.360" style="s2">tantric of course always knew this right</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.350" end="00:35:06.370" style="s2">sexuality was always in philosophy if</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.360" end="00:35:08.290" style="s2">you were an Easter so that&#39;s in India</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.370" end="00:35:09.850" style="s2">Iran China let&#39;s take it for granted I</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.290" end="00:35:11.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know where this prudishness came</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.850" end="00:35:13.540" style="s2">from in Europe probably from</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.410" end="00:35:15.850" style="s2">Christianity but it didn&#39;t help us much</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.540" end="00:35:17.500" style="s2">and and all I say to people is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.850" end="00:35:20.830" style="s2">never trust a guy who doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.500" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">functioning sex life right cuz that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.830" end="00:35:25.300" style="s2">would permeates into everything he says</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:28.090" style="s2">and thinks what I don&#39;t trust a monk or</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.300" end="00:35:29.559" style="s2">something leader o monks often have very</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.090" end="00:35:33.369" style="s2">functioning</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.559" end="00:35:34.809" style="s2">because their tantric yeah no no I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.369" end="00:35:36.490" style="s2">say people who thought seriously about</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.809" end="00:35:38.200" style="s2">it and made decisions on how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.490" end="00:35:39.579" style="s2">gonna direct their sexual energy into</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.200" end="00:35:40.470" style="s2">something more spiritual they know what</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.579" end="00:35:44.619" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.470" end="00:35:47.730" style="s2">I don&#39;t people who are unable to embody</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.619" end="00:35:51.460" style="s2">that well people who tried to avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.730" end="00:35:53.289" style="s2">right are going to just abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.460" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">intellectualization in the mind because</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.289" end="00:35:59.950" style="s2">they they&#39;re just uncomfortable in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">body and exactly so I don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.950" end="00:36:05.260" style="s2">anybody speaks highly of young but</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:08.410" style="s2">refuses to deal with Freud was young</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.260" end="00:36:09.700" style="s2">tries to desexualize Freud&#39;s work he</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.410" end="00:36:11.170" style="s2">goes off in some really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.700" end="00:36:13.299" style="s2">directions because of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.170" end="00:36:16.569" style="s2">he&#39;s very useful but at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.299" end="00:36:18.430" style="s2">day there&#39;s a sexuality lacking in Jung</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.569" end="00:36:23.460" style="s2">he probably fucked his patients that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.430" end="00:36:27.849" style="s2">what he did okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.460" end="00:36:30.069" style="s2">he was quite sexual yeah but you eat in</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.849" end="00:36:32.410" style="s2">terms of activity but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.069" end="00:36:35.980" style="s2">problem was that his work then wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.410" end="00:36:38.140" style="s2">consequent with that so ya know Yuki was</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.980" end="00:36:40.269" style="s2">not a I&#39;ve heard he was not a father</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.140" end="00:36:47.740" style="s2">figure like he was more like everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.269" end="00:36:49.089" style="s2">friend aim is cool but you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.740" end="00:36:49.690" style="s2">young without Friday or you missed the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.089" end="00:36:51.430" style="s2">point entirely</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.690" end="00:36:54.339" style="s2">and with Hegel it&#39;s the opposite way</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.430" end="00:36:56.470" style="s2">Hegel has enormous phallic energy but</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.339" end="00:36:59.430" style="s2">the phallic energy in Hegel is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.470" end="00:37:01.990" style="s2">completely turned into theoretical game</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.430" end="00:37:03.369" style="s2">what it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a priest to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.990" end="00:37:04.960" style="s2">Dawson of a chieftain and place the</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.369" end="00:37:07.059" style="s2">priest a game fully that&#39;s why I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.960" end="00:37:09.430" style="s2">higer Leo you can&#39;t be a priest up being</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.059" end="00:37:10.029" style="s2">a galleon yeah because he go makes you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.430" end="00:37:11.289" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.029" end="00:37:13.509" style="s2">okay so you learn how to think from</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.509" end="00:37:19.299" style="s2">he left behind was precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.289" end="00:37:20.289" style="s2">revolution of the 19th century when</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.960" end="00:37:28.779" style="s2">and they all dealt with willpower the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.049" end="00:37:31.660" style="s2">old that willpower was what puts things</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.279" end="00:40:05.589" style="s2">deep history deep psychology deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.460" end="00:40:06.940" style="s2">science and we need to go deep we need</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.589" end="00:40:09.160" style="s2">to understand physics we need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.940" end="00:40:10.630" style="s2">understand biology and you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.160" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">complexity theory and you say will</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.630" end="00:40:14.769" style="s2">something just emerge and he was you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:17.049" style="s2">know bigger than the sum of its parts</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.769" end="00:40:19.390" style="s2">but that&#39;s just sloppy what is emergence</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.049" end="00:40:20.950" style="s2">yeah well in sneaker and other guys have</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.390" end="00:40:22.269" style="s2">worked extensively on this they should</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.950" end="00:40:24.099" style="s2">try to solve this in what is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.269" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">emergence and what qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.099" end="00:40:27.549" style="s2">differences are there between emergences</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:29.890" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.549" end="00:40:31.329" style="s2">emergences just humans not all events</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.890" end="00:40:33.460" style="s2">are equal some events are way more</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.329" end="00:40:35.950" style="s2">valuable to us than other than sorry and</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.460" end="00:40:38.230" style="s2">this study is called of ontology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.950" end="00:40:40.450" style="s2">also new area philosophy today we need</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.230" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">an ontology we need to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.450" end="00:40:45.069" style="s2">is it along the time axis the realest</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:46.630" style="s2">value to us which ones are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.069" end="00:40:48.490" style="s2">singularities which ones are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.630" end="00:40:50.890" style="s2">emergence which one are the events that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.490" end="00:40:52.779" style="s2">happen among the time axis why are they</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.890" end="00:40:58.059" style="s2">valuable to us and how do we relate that</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.779" end="00:40:59.410" style="s2">to our own spiritual experiences so we</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.059" end="00:41:01.779" style="s2">can contain and cultivate those</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.410" end="00:41:04.839" style="s2">experiences and memorize them and use</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.779" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">them so all of this work has to be done</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:09.039" style="s2">yeah in ontology know it all oh gee are</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:10.990" style="s2">my two favorite areas at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.039" end="00:41:12.460" style="s2">I work with they tie into many of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.990" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">traditional areas like better physics</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.460" end="00:41:15.670" style="s2">and phenomenology but that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:17.079" style="s2">work at the moment and anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.670" end="00:41:18.670" style="s2">interested in these things and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.079" end="00:41:21.279" style="s2">working on it or a student of these</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.670" end="00:41:23.890" style="s2">matters please get in contact with us</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.279" end="00:41:26.200" style="s2">and we&#39;ll start the dialogue and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.890" end="00:41:28.720" style="s2">go forward together okay you just said</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.200" end="00:41:33.130" style="s2">50 about 50 things that could could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.720" end="00:41:35.799" style="s2">other conversations yeah I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.130" end="00:41:38.970" style="s2">know where to go now well I got the</p>
