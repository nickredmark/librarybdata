<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">want it to exist on this planet I agree</p>

<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">think that the way to do that is to make</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:54.750" style="s2">for what I am proposing which is that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.059" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">create a global tech cooperative so that</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.750" end="00:00:58.920" style="s2">we are the ones in control of the tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">company that we utilize because</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.920" end="00:01:03.539" style="s2">currently on this planet tech companies</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">have a lot of power Google and Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.539" end="00:01:08.340" style="s2">with the data we&#39;ve given them have a</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.770" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">they get to bankrupt other companies or</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:16.170" style="s2">buy them out and either choose to have</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.170" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">our data and control what access we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:23.850" style="s2">to information they are powerful so why</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">don&#39;t we retain that why don&#39;t we create</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.850" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">that that we want to use we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.640" style="s2">to convince I bring one else is using</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.570" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">Google and Facebook we only need a small</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.640" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">group of people enough to make it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">usable threshold and if you create for</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">that small group of people with their</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">input and with them being members them</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">financing it then getting to be to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">decide from the ground up how we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.590" style="s2">governance how we have how we trust it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">smaller group of people to run it for us</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.590" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to be more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">to have a board of directors run it for</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:55.770" style="s2">us but we don&#39;t want a board of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">directors acting like Google and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.770" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">Facebook already do and working against</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">our best interest on the planet so tech</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:06.990" style="s2">companies have power so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">utilize a tech company in order to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.990" end="00:02:11.030" style="s2">harness our collective power at the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:13.670" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.030" end="00:02:16.790" style="s2">it is only a tech company it does not</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.670" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">control your life it you get to bring to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.790" end="00:02:21.740" style="s2">it what you choose to bring to it so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:24.020" style="s2">we create a system to use your data to</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.740" end="00:02:25.550" style="s2">cure cancer you&#39;re in control of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.020" end="00:02:27.470" style="s2">data you get to choose whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.550" end="00:02:29.720" style="s2">you give it the only way you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.470" end="00:02:32.840" style="s2">give it is if it&#39;s if it&#39;s voluntary and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.720" end="00:02:34.460" style="s2">safe and so we have to create systems to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.840" end="00:02:36.650" style="s2">make it more and more easy for people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.460" end="00:02:39.650" style="s2">collaborate at no point are we forcing</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.650" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">people we have to just keep asking how</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.650" end="00:02:43.130" style="s2">can we get you to do what we want what</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">would be in the greater good not you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.130" end="00:02:46.850" style="s2">have to do what&#39;s in the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:47.720" style="s2">that is hierarchy down and we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.850" end="00:02:49.970" style="s2">it I mean I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.720" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">proposing because most of what I know is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.970" end="00:02:53.090" style="s2">somebody deciding this is how the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:55.790" style="s2">should work and we&#39;re gonna force it to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.090" end="00:03:00.230" style="s2">work that way even in anarchy yes maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.790" end="00:03:01.670" style="s2">especially in anarchy and so to be able</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.230" end="00:03:04.130" style="s2">to create a world that works for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.670" end="00:03:06.020" style="s2">everybody we don&#39;t actually need to take</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.130" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">over a nation because if we took over a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.020" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">nation do we do then do you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:13.810" style="s2">run an economy do you know how to do any</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:17.000" style="s2">of it our politicians don&#39;t even know so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.810" end="00:03:18.860" style="s2">what I&#39;m proposing is we create it with</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.000" end="00:03:20.930" style="s2">the scaffolding within our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.860" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">capitalist system so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.930" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">dismantle it because currently if it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.090" style="s2">went away tomorrow we don&#39;t have food in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:28.700" style="s2">the supermarkets and people starve we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.090" end="00:03:31.130" style="s2">have chaos and violence and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.700" end="00:03:32.900" style="s2">chaos and violence so I want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.130" end="00:03:36.260" style="s2">system that works from within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.900" end="00:03:39.019" style="s2">current one with a tech company at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.260" end="00:03:40.580" style="s2">same time it is only a tech company it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.019" end="00:03:41.660" style="s2">not gonna tell you how many children you</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.580" end="00:03:43.220" style="s2">can have it&#39;s not going to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.660" end="00:03:45.140" style="s2">where you can live and how you can live</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.220" end="00:03:47.630" style="s2">and it&#39;s not gonna be able to pass laws</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.140" end="00:03:49.970" style="s2">all it can which are current ones doo</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.630" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">doo Google a Facebook get to get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.970" end="00:03:53.390" style="s2">lobby and basically pass laws but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:55.580" style="s2">they&#39;re not transparent about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.390" end="00:03:57.440" style="s2">we can be transparent about it we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.580" end="00:03:59.989" style="s2">create systems to take back our actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.440" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">democracies easily for the hands of in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.989" end="00:04:04.670" style="s2">the hands of the people who are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">voters in that democracy we can use our</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.670" end="00:04:08.690" style="s2">tech company to take back our economics</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.530" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">to have access to the information on the</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.370" end="00:04:17.419" style="s2">have to have my values we can create it</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.250" end="00:04:19.160" style="s2">so that it doesn&#39;t matter what your</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.160" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">alignment and how could we create</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:23.330" style="s2">products that are healthy and good for</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">the environment and have</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.370" end="00:04:53.780" style="s2">for all of it because we bring our minds</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.889" end="00:04:55.490" style="s2">together somebody knows how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.780" end="00:04:57.050" style="s2">and when we decide and it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.490" end="00:04:59.270" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be one food system and one</p>

<p begin="00:04:59.270" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">that it means that like we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:07.129" style="s2">efficiency of one food system but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:09.710" style="s2">choice of many different options so you</p>
