    "description": "Becoming Agile People in organizations has two parts: 1) recovering what is natural about the human condition and 2) developing new ways of working together. One is a kind of unlearningâ€“ we unlearn the old social conditioning, and re-connect with our natural human enthusiasm for being together. There is an evolutionary dynamic underlying the complex processes of human relating. This is the basis of self-organization that we can trust. There is also the challenge for us to become more than we have been before. This is part of the adventure and never ending story that emerges as we build trust with each other.",
