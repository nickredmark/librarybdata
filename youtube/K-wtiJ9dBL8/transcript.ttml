<p begin="00:00:11.710" end="00:00:16.059" style="s2">from one side to the other there is one</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.139" end="00:00:17.770" style="s2">person that we&#39;re going to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.059" end="00:00:21.150" style="s2">right off the bat I don&#39;t know who that</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.770" end="00:00:24.099" style="s2">is but John does she spoke to me in yes</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.969" end="00:00:44.789" style="s2">the how this relates to our attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.210" end="00:00:46.899" style="s2">with regards to climate change please</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.789" end="00:00:51.609" style="s2">thank you what I really wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.899" end="00:00:53.710" style="s2">address this because I I want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.609" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">this question somewhat at length okay so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.710" end="00:01:03.399" style="s2">this would be a long answer so a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">colleague and supporter of mine Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.399" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">Bjorkman talks about what he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:12.210" style="s2">meta-crisis see it&#39;s getting even darker</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:18.790" style="s2">and he talks about that you know of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.130" end="00:01:20.920" style="s2">course includes climate change and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.790" end="00:01:23.140" style="s2">includes growing socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.920" end="00:01:27.790" style="s2">disparity and the social stressors that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.140" end="00:01:29.740" style="s2">that is causing we don&#39;t it&#39;s not in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.790" end="00:01:34.990" style="s2">news right now but the energy crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.740" end="00:01:37.270" style="s2">going to return inevitably and what do</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.990" end="00:01:39.850" style="s2">you and we are also facing at the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.270" end="00:01:42.820" style="s2">time for some reasons you might have</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.850" end="00:01:48.130" style="s2">seen or at least can divine from what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.820" end="00:01:49.899" style="s2">said we&#39;re facing progressive senses of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.130" end="00:01:51.729" style="s2">alienation and disenfranchisement from</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.899" end="00:01:55.030" style="s2">public institutions people are losing</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.729" end="00:01:58.110" style="s2">faith in the institutions and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.030" end="00:02:06.189" style="s2">institutions are responding with</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.110" end="00:02:08.410" style="s2">stagnation and gridlock so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.189" end="00:02:09.789" style="s2">factors are not independent that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.410" end="00:02:12.730" style="s2">he calls it a meta crisis they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.789" end="00:02:14.340" style="s2">mutually reinforcing each other the meta</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.730" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.340" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">now here&#39;s the thing that I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">about what I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:27.879" style="s2">let&#39;s take climate change as it clearly</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:31.329" style="s2">right it&#39;s exactly trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.879" end="00:02:34.390" style="s2">it is exacerbated by these these these</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.329" end="00:02:37.090" style="s2">issues of social alienation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.390" end="00:02:38.530" style="s2">political polarization and stagnation</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.090" end="00:02:42.190" style="s2">because we get a lot of disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.530" end="00:02:44.110" style="s2">about it but in terms of the science the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.190" end="00:02:46.930" style="s2">science is in and it&#39;s been in for quite</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.110" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">a while and it&#39;s convincing right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.930" end="00:02:51.040" style="s2">the fact that some people are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:52.930" style="s2">make us hold this science to standards</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.040" end="00:02:55.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t hold medical science to is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.930" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">ridiculous well you can&#39;t prove it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.480" end="00:03:00.220" style="s2">ok I can&#39;t really prove the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:02.739" style="s2">asking me that this bacteria causes</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.220" end="00:03:04.510" style="s2">everybody to have this disease but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.739" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">don&#39;t require that level of proof</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.510" end="00:03:10.420" style="s2">because people are dying from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">disease and the planet is dying from</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.420" end="00:03:19.180" style="s2">these issues we know this so the reason</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:22.269" style="s2">why promise is interested in my work I</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:24.250" style="s2">believe is because I&#39;ve proposed that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.269" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">the meaning crisis and the meta crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:30.310" style="s2">are interlocking that the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">is helping to exacerbate these factors</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.310" end="00:03:35.739" style="s2">it&#39;s creating a kind of mental fog it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:38.530" style="s2">creating a tendency to reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.739" end="00:03:40.329" style="s2">narrowing and cognitive inflexibility</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.530" end="00:03:43.389" style="s2">like being trapped in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.329" end="00:03:50.349" style="s2">formulation of the mutilated chessboard</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.389" end="00:03:52.629" style="s2">so that we can&#39;t break out I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.349" end="00:03:53.650" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s feedback before I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.629" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">go into my next point there&#39;s feedback</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.650" end="00:03:57.250" style="s2">when people look out and see a world</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:59.919" style="s2">that in many ways they feel is dying</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.250" end="00:04:01.750" style="s2">that reinforces the meaning crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.919" end="00:04:05.379" style="s2">they&#39;re feeding on each other the mental</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.750" end="00:04:07.959" style="s2">fogging right and it&#39;s making it harder</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.379" end="00:04:09.340" style="s2">and harder for us to get the needed</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.959" end="00:04:11.290" style="s2">innovation because we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.340" end="00:04:12.819" style="s2">make fundamental transformations in who</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.290" end="00:04:17.500" style="s2">and what we are in order to dress</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.819" end="00:04:19.810" style="s2">address the meta-crisis I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.500" end="00:04:21.820" style="s2">that point even more profoundly we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.810" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2">comprehensive transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.820" end="00:04:25.010" style="s2">cognition consciousness character and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:27.590" style="s2">commune</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.010" end="00:04:30.950" style="s2">and the only thing that has done that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.590" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">for us in the past comprehensively have</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.950" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">been religions we tried political</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:41.780" style="s2">alternatives in the 20th century and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:46.160" style="s2">they drenched the world in Titanic and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.780" end="00:04:48.980" style="s2">terrifying amounts of blood so the nuns</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.160" end="00:04:51.260" style="s2">and no NES look at that and they say no</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.980" end="00:04:55.930" style="s2">no there is no political solution to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.260" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">quote the police the rock group right</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.930" end="00:05:03.290" style="s2">but because of the meeting crisis they</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:05.150" style="s2">find and this is I need you to hear this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.290" end="00:05:07.670" style="s2">deeply I need you to hear this deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.150" end="00:05:10.370" style="s2">they find the existing religions</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.670" end="00:05:12.650" style="s2">irrelevant they don&#39;t find them faults</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.370" end="00:05:14.830" style="s2">the new atheists are dropping in</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.650" end="00:05:17.480" style="s2">importance it&#39;s not a falsity issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.830" end="00:05:19.910" style="s2">because way before you make judgments of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.480" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">truth you have to be bound to something</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.910" end="00:05:26.570" style="s2">in relevance they reject these religions</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:28.280" style="s2">because they find them irrelevant one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.570" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">the things I explore them to my series</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.280" end="00:05:32.120" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis is how</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:34.610" style="s2">did we get to this place where we are so</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.120" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">so in such a wisdom famine and we are so</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.610" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">disconnected from those sets of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:43.160" style="s2">practices that could potentially offer</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">us the comprehensive transformation we</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.160" end="00:05:48.590" style="s2">need I talked about this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:49.910" style="s2">of needing a religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.590" end="00:05:52.520" style="s2">religion we need something that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.910" end="00:05:54.200" style="s2">comprehensive so it needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.520" end="00:05:55.970" style="s2">religion in that sense but they can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.200" end="00:05:59.420" style="s2">any of the established religions and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.970" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">can&#39;t be the political pseudo religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.420" end="00:06:07.960" style="s2">ideologies that led to totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">terror so we&#39;re locked we&#39;re locked and</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:15.590" style="s2">that&#39;s how these people feel they feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:18.140" style="s2">that there&#39;s no political solution and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.590" end="00:06:19.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no traditional solution there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.140" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">no religious solution there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.940" end="00:06:24.610" style="s2">political solution so we need a religion</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:28.930" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.610" end="00:06:30.980" style="s2">how do we do that and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.930" end="00:06:33.890" style="s2">and I was talking to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.980" end="00:06:35.750" style="s2">during the break and I want to point</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.890" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">something out and it goes towards that</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.750" end="00:06:39.610" style="s2">modal confusion we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.020" end="00:06:46.060" style="s2">there&#39;s subjective well-being which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.290" end="00:06:50.050" style="s2">how well do you feel how good it like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.060" end="00:06:52.770" style="s2">how good is how good are you feeling you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.050" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">have enough stuff you&#39;re feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.770" end="00:06:58.060" style="s2">healthy vital so our culture loves</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:00.280" style="s2">subjective well-being it pumps us and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.060" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">pumps more get more get more it tells us</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.280" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">kind of the wrong thing it tells us get</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:06.520" style="s2">more wealth and power because that will</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">increase your subjective well-being the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.520" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">problem with that is the curve looks</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:10.600" style="s2">like this initially as they get more</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:13.690" style="s2">wealth and power subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.600" end="00:07:15.610" style="s2">goes up really fast and then once I pass</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.690" end="00:07:17.289" style="s2">the threshold of plateaus and so it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:18.970" style="s2">becomes irrational I have to get huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.289" end="00:07:20.770" style="s2">differences in wealth to make small</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.970" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">differences in subjective well-being so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.770" end="00:07:25.449" style="s2">we&#39;re locked into frustration and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:28.090" style="s2">secondly it confuses and conflates modal</p>

<p begin="00:08:30.639" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">wisdom they will reciprocally narrow</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:44.200" style="s2">lifestyle and not make the needed</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.450" end="00:08:47.970" style="s2">changes that&#39;s how I think the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.200" end="00:08:47.970" style="s2">crisis and the meta crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.750" end="00:08:54.920" style="s2">other questions</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.009" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard one to follow I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.889" end="00:09:09.109" style="s2">go back to what you talked about with</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:11.959" style="s2">addiction yes and the opening and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.109" end="00:09:14.269" style="s2">closing and you you said with video</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.959" end="00:09:17.029" style="s2">games which are considered to be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.269" end="00:09:20.149" style="s2">addiction by many that that flow</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.029" end="00:09:22.910" style="s2">increases right the attraction expert</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.149" end="00:09:25.819" style="s2">flow is a good thing if you&#39;re rock</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.910" end="00:09:28.970" style="s2">climbing and so are there qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.819" end="00:09:30.769" style="s2">differences yeah yep the kinds of flow</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.970" end="00:09:33.410" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent question so she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.769" end="00:09:35.209" style="s2">putting her finger on a potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.410" end="00:09:36.559" style="s2">looming contradiction and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.209" end="00:09:38.509" style="s2">try and alleviate that I&#39;ve done some</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.559" end="00:09:42.499" style="s2">work with Alex funk on this and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.509" end="00:09:45.829" style="s2">people so the thing about rock climbing</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.499" end="00:09:47.809" style="s2">is because you&#39;re interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.829" end="00:09:49.850" style="s2">causal structures of the world it</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.809" end="00:09:52.249" style="s2">actually is transferable believe it or</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.850" end="00:09:56.779" style="s2">not to the world at large let me give</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.249" end="00:09:58.459" style="s2">you my own personal example of this so a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.779" end="00:10:01.509" style="s2">long time ago I started doing Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.459" end="00:10:04.309" style="s2">Chuan and Taoism is the religion of flow</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.509" end="00:10:08.149" style="s2">that&#39;s the Tai Chi is about getting you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.309" end="00:10:10.610" style="s2">into the flow state and for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.149" end="00:10:13.369" style="s2">time I was just doing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.610" end="00:10:15.589" style="s2">something happened people came up to me</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.369" end="00:10:17.720" style="s2">because I was in grad school and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.589" end="00:10:20.119" style="s2">said what&#39;s going on and I thought oh no</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.720" end="00:10:21.489" style="s2">I&#39;ve done something wrong and I said</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.119" end="00:10:24.379" style="s2">what do you mean and they said you were</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.489" end="00:10:26.209" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking differently you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.379" end="00:10:30.769" style="s2">arguing differently you&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.209" end="00:10:33.529" style="s2">differently and and it was the Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.769" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">skills were member of being a general</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.529" end="00:10:37.879" style="s2">problem solver we&#39;re generalizing they</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.879" style="s2">were percolating through my life because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.879" end="00:10:42.889" style="s2">Tai Chi moves my real body in the real</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.879" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">world and gets me to move my attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.889" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">in the real environment and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:48.379" style="s2">actually and it gets me to try and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:54.379" style="s2">balance and inward and out all of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.379" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">stuff so the paradox of flow and video</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.379" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">games is you&#39;re getting the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:11:01.220" style="s2">opening within a world that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:05.389" style="s2">closing you off so there isn&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.220" end="00:11:06.949" style="s2">a contradiction so Alex funk talked my</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.389" end="00:11:10.180" style="s2">student talks about this he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.949" end="00:11:13.910" style="s2">what you do is you get</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.180" end="00:11:18.170" style="s2">local agency enhancement in the game at</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.910" end="00:11:21.620" style="s2">the expense of real-world agency and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.170" end="00:11:24.050" style="s2">well though and and this is what I tried</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.620" end="00:11:26.750" style="s2">to show you the very machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.050" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">makes you adaptive can be hijacked in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.750" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">negative way and so the video games are</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.560" style="s2">hijacking the flow and meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:35.450" style="s2">because I try to show you both of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.560" end="00:11:37.910" style="s2">but they&#39;re doing it in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.450" end="00:11:51.970" style="s2">actually ultimately starves you because</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.910" end="00:11:56.200" style="s2">it can&#39;t generalize I I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.970" end="00:12:01.030" style="s2">formulate my question meaningfully the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.200" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">neurotransmitter analogy with reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.030" end="00:12:09.580" style="s2">narrowing reciprocal opening and</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:12.350" style="s2">changing our arena the impact of of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.580" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">antidepressants our addiction to an</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.350" end="00:12:19.460" style="s2">antidepressant society and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:22.670" style="s2">happening to seniors who are locked in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.460" end="00:12:24.860" style="s2">sometimes all of that is part of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.670" end="00:12:37.700" style="s2">question in the context of what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.860" end="00:12:39.470" style="s2">described yeah no no this like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.700" end="00:12:45.070" style="s2">big thing you guys are all asking</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.470" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">somebody asked me a small question so</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.070" end="00:12:50.480" style="s2">again again this is a kind of modal</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:12:54.190" style="s2">confusion we&#39;re getting locked into a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.480" end="00:12:56.600" style="s2">having mode of dispensing medication and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.190" end="00:12:58.640" style="s2">forgetting about the being mode that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.600" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">needed for therapeutic intervention so</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.640" end="00:13:04.130" style="s2">the research shows that you need a triad</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:06.710" style="s2">to deal with to help people you yes you</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.130" end="00:13:09.110" style="s2">should use medication but you also need</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.710" end="00:13:11.480" style="s2">consistent long term therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.110" end="00:13:13.010" style="s2">intervention and you also need a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.480" end="00:13:15.770" style="s2">reorganization of the person&#39;s social</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.010" end="00:13:17.510" style="s2">network you need a much more</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.770" end="00:13:19.940" style="s2">comprehensive strategy and we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.510" end="00:13:21.530" style="s2">tended to go to this poll because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.940" end="00:13:21.750" style="s2">easily marketable and it&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.530" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.750" end="00:13:27.930" style="s2">have and take you take your medication</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:31.740" style="s2">rather than how are you going to undergo</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.930" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">a process of transformation and so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.740" end="00:13:36.810" style="s2">fact that we are doing that is making a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:39.660" style="s2">problematic because what you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.810" end="00:13:41.400" style="s2">happening in the therapeutic world is</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.660" end="00:13:42.660" style="s2">you and it&#39;s really interesting I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.400" end="00:13:44.780" style="s2">again talking to somebody during the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.660" end="00:13:49.110" style="s2">break about this you see people taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.780" end="00:13:51.180" style="s2">CBT right which is actually derived from</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.110" end="00:13:52.890" style="s2">stoicism explicitly as a wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.180" end="00:13:54.390" style="s2">tradition cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.890" end="00:13:56.850" style="s2">you see them integrating that with</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.390" end="00:14:01.530" style="s2">emotion focused therapy right you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.850" end="00:14:04.530" style="s2">them integrating that with sort of forms</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.530" end="00:14:06.860" style="s2">of serious play therapy you see them</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.530" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">then recommending that people take up a</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.860" end="00:14:11.280" style="s2">more comprehensive way of life like</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:13.050" style="s2">stoas what you see is the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.280" end="00:14:14.850" style="s2">world is moving towards sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.050" end="00:14:19.710" style="s2">organically without realizing it trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.850" end="00:14:21.840" style="s2">to grow a religion for people but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.710" end="00:14:26.010" style="s2">problem is the religion is bloody</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.840" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">expensive its elitist in a financial</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.010" end="00:14:33.390" style="s2">sense so the growth shows I think a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:36.600" style="s2">correct inkling about what is needed but</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.390" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">the way we have set it into sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.600" end="00:14:42.030" style="s2">capitalist market mentality is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:47.640" style="s2">going to thwart it to deal or what it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.030" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">needs what we really need to do another</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.640" end="00:14:50.180" style="s2">question please</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.370" end="00:15:03.350" style="s2">here&#39;s an easy question can you come and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.589" end="00:15:09.190" style="s2">the popularity of a Jordan Peterson your</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.350" end="00:15:17.050" style="s2">colleague that&#39;s not an easy question</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.190" end="00:15:20.209" style="s2">okay so haha I know Jordan personally</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.050" end="00:15:25.699" style="s2">and I knew Jordan before you became a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.209" end="00:15:28.250" style="s2">God because he kind of is that and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.699" end="00:15:32.930" style="s2">also know I also knew him in the context</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.250" end="00:15:35.630" style="s2">of we shared many students at U of T and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.930" end="00:15:36.800" style="s2">we were in groups together we appeared</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.630" end="00:15:39.319" style="s2">at conferences together we spoke</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.800" end="00:15:41.240" style="s2">together his first non-political video</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.319" end="00:15:44.779" style="s2">that went big was his discussion with me</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.240" end="00:15:46.940" style="s2">about meeting in life okay so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.779" end="00:15:51.500" style="s2">intimately involved now Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.940" end="00:15:53.420" style="s2">inaccessible and here&#39;s the thing first</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.500" end="00:15:57.010" style="s2">of all I want to say right away this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.420" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">Jordan is a really complex guy like</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.010" end="00:16:01.310" style="s2">trying to comment him is like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:02.660" style="s2">comment on like assignment rice or</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.310" end="00:16:04.880" style="s2">something there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.660" end="00:16:06.889" style="s2">happening all at once that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2">difficult so that&#39;s why I&#39;m being very</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.889" end="00:16:10.519" style="s2">guarded and like I said I have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.540" end="00:16:12.380" style="s2">personal relationship to him and I have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.519" end="00:16:14.199" style="s2">to somehow keep that separate from my</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.380" end="00:16:16.930" style="s2">professional relationship with him</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.199" end="00:16:21.589" style="s2">because I think there&#39;s two reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.930" end="00:16:24.829" style="s2">Jordan is famous is that the right</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.589" end="00:16:27.709" style="s2">adjective and I think they&#39;re they</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.829" end="00:16:31.029" style="s2">interconnect but in ways that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.709" end="00:16:34.970" style="s2">more carefully critiqued and understood</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.029" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">one reason is Jordan put his finger on</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.970" end="00:16:39.829" style="s2">the meaning crisis I know this because</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:41.300" style="s2">like I said we talked we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.829" end="00:16:43.930" style="s2">about meaning in life right the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">big video was the meaning in life video</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.930" end="00:16:48.680" style="s2">but he also so he&#39;s got one finger on</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:51.589" style="s2">the meaning crisis and that&#39;s why he can</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.680" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">do things like do a series on the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.589" end="00:16:57.139" style="s2">and hundreds of thousands of people will</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:58.970" style="s2">watch it but he like</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.139" end="00:17:01.069" style="s2">and these to reinforce each other he</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.970" end="00:17:05.179" style="s2">also put his finger on a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.069" end="00:17:08.630" style="s2">political anger and frustration in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.179" end="00:17:10.399" style="s2">culture he put his finger on that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.630" end="00:17:12.529" style="s2">that&#39;s feet I want to be fair to myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.399" end="00:17:14.299" style="s2">here now I have explicitly said these</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.529" end="00:17:14.659" style="s2">things to Jordan so I&#39;m not speaking out</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.299" end="00:17:17.899" style="s2">of turn</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.659" end="00:17:20.659" style="s2">I am very critical of sort of his</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.899" end="00:17:22.699" style="s2">political response I think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.659" end="00:17:25.549" style="s2">misrepresents the issue in some skewed</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.699" end="00:17:27.589" style="s2">ways I&#39;ll give you one clear example and</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.549" end="00:17:30.889" style="s2">it&#39;s the one that made him famous again</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.589" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">please give me some charity here because</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.889" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">I I think Jordan has a lot to say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:38.029" style="s2">important and I like Jordan but that</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">whole issue about the pronouns I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.029" end="00:17:42.889" style="s2">their psychology department I have never</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">met anybody that came to me from their</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.889" end="00:17:46.789" style="s2">pronouns that was martyred motivated by</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:51.289" style="s2">cultural Marxism I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.789" end="00:17:53.179" style="s2">that is every time because it&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.289" end="00:17:55.610" style="s2">to me repeatedly somebody came to me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.179" end="00:17:59.179" style="s2">they came to me respectfully they were</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.610" end="00:18:00.919" style="s2">in pain then they asked for me to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.179" end="00:18:02.630" style="s2">something that the university is</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.919" end="00:18:05.990" style="s2">supposed to help people do which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.630" end="00:18:09.019" style="s2">experiment with new identity and so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.990" end="00:18:11.360" style="s2">said yes and I was happy to do so so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.019" end="00:18:14.179" style="s2">don&#39;t know what that was compared to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.360" end="00:18:18.139" style="s2">what I actually encountered in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.179" end="00:18:20.750" style="s2">teaching so I&#39;m very hesitant about his</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.139" end="00:18:23.330" style="s2">political side for political reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.750" end="00:18:25.789" style="s2">for I don&#39;t think it was capturing what</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.330" end="00:18:27.559" style="s2">I saw at the University of Toronto now</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.789" end="00:18:29.690" style="s2">was he treated appropriately when he</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.559" end="00:18:31.549" style="s2">began he brought that issue up no he</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.690" end="00:18:33.470" style="s2">wasn&#39;t he should have been properly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.549" end="00:18:35.419" style="s2">debated I would have loved to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.470" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">debated Jordan on this because it would</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.419" end="00:18:39.409" style="s2">have been mutually respectful when I</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:41.210" style="s2">sent my criticisms to him he said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.409" end="00:18:45.940" style="s2">great because I presented counter</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.210" end="00:18:54.649" style="s2">arguments they tried to silence him and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.940" end="00:19:01.270" style="s2">that was wrong that was wrong they</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.649" end="00:19:03.169" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have done that so</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.270" end="00:19:09.799" style="s2">this is why this is turning out to be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.169" end="00:19:15.110" style="s2">hard question I think that Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.799" end="00:19:17.620" style="s2">important because he brings into</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.110" end="00:19:21.110" style="s2">awareness the meaning crisis its</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.620" end="00:19:23.539" style="s2">connections to religion and its tortured</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.110" end="00:19:24.919" style="s2">connections but important connections to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.539" end="00:19:27.500" style="s2">political frustration and</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.919" end="00:19:29.450" style="s2">disenfranchisement and issues about</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.500" end="00:19:31.669" style="s2">identity because issues of identity are</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.450" end="00:19:35.299" style="s2">also all I would argue ultimately issues</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.669" end="00:19:36.590" style="s2">about your existential mode and we I</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.299" end="00:19:39.020" style="s2">think we should try and shift language</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:44.929" style="s2">away from having an identity to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.020" end="00:19:46.730" style="s2">a person that&#39;s moral confusion and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.929" end="00:19:48.500" style="s2">points towards well I think Jordan is</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.730" end="00:19:50.150" style="s2">good to put his finger on these things I</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.500" end="00:19:54.590" style="s2">have criticisms of it</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.150" end="00:19:56.000" style="s2">I think his Jungian approach to try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.590" end="00:19:59.390" style="s2">understanding the meaning crisis while</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.000" end="00:20:01.370" style="s2">valuable is insufficient I also have</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.390" end="00:20:04.190" style="s2">criticisms of his interpretation of Jung</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.370" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">he is he&#39;s interpreted Jung largely in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.190" end="00:20:07.760" style="s2">way that is an apologetic for</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:09.590" style="s2">Christianity traditional theistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.760" end="00:20:11.539" style="s2">Christianity I think that is a deepness</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.590" end="00:20:12.650" style="s2">reading of Jung I have a video that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.539" end="00:20:14.210" style="s2">they&#39;re talking to a union</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.650" end="00:20:16.970" style="s2">psychotherapist where we discussed that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.210" end="00:20:20.150" style="s2">issue is Jordan right that mythology</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.970" end="00:20:22.309" style="s2">matters yes it does but I&#39;m I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.150" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">about his use of Jung and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.309" end="00:20:28.370" style="s2">the issue of meaning in life should be</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:30.140" style="s2">tackled with our comprehensive cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.370" end="00:20:31.850" style="s2">science not just from a Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:32.890" style="s2">framework which is what I tried to show</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.850" end="00:20:35.539" style="s2">you here today</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.890" end="00:20:41.030" style="s2">okay that&#39;s my best answer for that very</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.539" end="00:20:44.179" style="s2">difficult problem thank you for what</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.030" end="00:20:47.000" style="s2">seemed to be to me a postgraduate</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.179" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">lecture in psychology I&#39;m worried now</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.000" end="00:20:52.580" style="s2">that I stressed you guys out so go no</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:57.169" style="s2">don&#39;t ever invite him back or at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.580" end="00:20:58.900" style="s2">put a health warning before it begins my</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.169" end="00:21:04.340" style="s2">question has to do with their</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.900" end="00:21:07.340" style="s2">neuroimaging of brain function and being</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.340" end="00:21:09.220" style="s2">in the flow to me being in the flow</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.340" end="00:21:11.470" style="s2">could be something as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.220" end="00:21:13.299" style="s2">looking at a flyer and seeing grapes on</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.470" end="00:21:17.229" style="s2">sale for a dollar eighty nine and a</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.299" end="00:21:23.049" style="s2">pound or hiking out in a sailboat on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.229" end="00:21:26.769" style="s2">edge of capsizing and and being you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.049" end="00:21:30.820" style="s2">sailing across the lake or reading a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.769" end="00:21:33.690" style="s2">book and enjoying the moment so I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.820" end="00:21:38.470" style="s2">wonder have studies been done to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.690" end="00:21:41.950" style="s2">indicate the when when one might be in</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.470" end="00:21:44.470" style="s2">the flow and seems to me that&#39;s when one</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.950" end="00:21:47.080" style="s2">hobby what in flow has a lot to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.470" end="00:21:49.960" style="s2">mean I I didn&#39;t hear the last thing you</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.080" end="00:21:52.539" style="s2">said oh it seems to me that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.960" end="00:21:58.779" style="s2">studies of what have studies been done</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.539" end="00:22:01.239" style="s2">on when people are in flow oh okay great</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.779" end="00:22:03.960" style="s2">so I turn to right away from you at just</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.239" end="00:22:05.679" style="s2">the wrong moment I apologize for that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.960" end="00:22:07.419" style="s2">first of all I want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.679" end="00:22:08.979" style="s2">about the vogue there&#39;s been studies</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.419" end="00:22:11.559" style="s2">done on that but that&#39;s what was leaping</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.979" end="00:22:17.859" style="s2">into my mind and then you did that last</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.559" end="00:22:20.499" style="s2">thing at the end which is good too so</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.859" end="00:22:22.809" style="s2">this has happened you take articles that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.499" end="00:22:25.749" style="s2">have been rejected by journals you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.809" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">new nothing else to the articles but put</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.749" end="00:22:29.139" style="s2">in a neuroimaging of a brain you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:32.609" style="s2">resubmit</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.139" end="00:22:36.700" style="s2">the article and then it gets published</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.609" end="00:22:44.229" style="s2">this is happening so is there a vogue</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.700" end="00:22:46.960" style="s2">yeah here&#39;s the other thing neuroimaging</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.229" end="00:22:50.379" style="s2">is important but it is not the trump</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.960" end="00:22:53.349" style="s2">card evidence because you have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.379" end="00:22:55.599" style="s2">lot of you this is not a film of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.349" end="00:22:58.029" style="s2">brain you have to do lots of statistical</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.599" end="00:23:02.019" style="s2">processing lots of normalization before</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.029" end="00:23:03.849" style="s2">you get the data and secondly science is</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.019" end="00:23:05.889" style="s2">not just about improving your technology</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.849" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">you have to increase your theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.889" end="00:23:11.649" style="s2">acuity as you increase your</p>

<p begin="00:23:57.700" end="00:24:01.830" style="s2">reasons of evolution it&#39;s also in my air</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.129" end="00:24:04.090" style="s2">passageway so it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.830" end="00:24:06.879" style="s2">pre-designed it&#39;s what&#39;s called a pre</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.879" end="00:24:09.490" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be evolved from scratch</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.379" end="00:24:12.389" style="s2">does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.490" end="00:24:15.669" style="s2">that means evolution can go much faster</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.389" end="00:24:17.649" style="s2">your brain that&#39;s the same thing it</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.649" end="00:24:25.960" style="s2">adaptive and exams it so I take the area</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.309" end="00:24:28.509" style="s2">of my brain that&#39;s for fine grained</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.960" end="00:24:31.240" style="s2">movement with my right hand and I exact</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:42.580" style="s2">when I speak so the idea that you could</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.570" end="00:24:44.279" style="s2">oh well there&#39;s where the reasoning is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.580" end="00:24:48.490" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.279" end="00:24:51.220" style="s2">that&#39;s like phrenology the brain is much</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.490" end="00:24:53.409" style="s2">more dynamically constantly read it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.220" end="00:24:55.090" style="s2">like your brain is a machine of machines</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.409" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">that can constantly make itself into a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.090" end="00:25:01.269" style="s2">new kind of machine and so trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:03.549" style="s2">take pictures of that kind of machine</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.269" end="00:25:05.169" style="s2">are very very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.549" end="00:25:07.749" style="s2">no matter how precise your picture is</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.169" end="00:25:09.509" style="s2">unless you have an adequate theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.749" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">model it&#39;s going to be deeply misleading</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.509" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">so that&#39;s where we sit on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.200" end="00:25:22.149" style="s2">now have we done stuff when people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.759" end="00:25:23.889" style="s2">in flow yes we have we&#39;ve also done</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.149" end="00:25:24.999" style="s2">stuff when people are in insight and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.889" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">then I&#39;m going to tell you so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.999" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">go on under at this because it gets kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:30.909" style="s2">of creepy and terrifying so I&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.350" end="00:25:32.859" style="s2">keep continue with my theme of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.909" end="00:25:35.070" style="s2">general cheerfully presenting you darken</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.859" end="00:25:35.070" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.999" end="00:25:41.619" style="s2">so in the flow state it&#39;s not what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.239" end="00:25:43.359" style="s2">might think it&#39;s not your whole brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.619" end="00:25:48.549" style="s2">lights up actually most of your</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.359" end="00:25:51.369" style="s2">processing shuts down what I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.549" end="00:25:54.399" style="s2">limitless we only use 10% of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.369" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">that horrible that&#39;s just false okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.399" end="00:26:00.489" style="s2">that if I could if I could do one</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:04.349" style="s2">socially good thing here now is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.489" end="00:26:07.649" style="s2">that that&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.349" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">okay that&#39;s false</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.649" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">no qualification false false false false</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">okay because a lot of the time your</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:18.639" style="s2">performance improves by large areas of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:21.789" style="s2">your brain shutting off because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.639" end="00:26:24.849" style="s2">happening in flow is all of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.789" end="00:26:27.190" style="s2">extraneous processing is being reduced</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.849" end="00:26:33.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like a laser so that you get the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.190" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">focus you need for flow what about</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.940" end="00:26:43.809" style="s2">insight so what happens in the insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:45.220" style="s2">and again even left right that&#39;s miss</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.809" end="00:26:46.779" style="s2">right your left hemisphere is not a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.220" end="00:26:52.029" style="s2">fascist your right hemisphere is not an</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.779" end="00:26:54.369" style="s2">artist I&#39;m gonna be talking with you in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.029" end="00:26:56.379" style="s2">a Goa crest about all of this stuff in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.369" end="00:26:58.629" style="s2">couple weeks on Robo wisdom but anyways</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.379" end="00:27:01.149" style="s2">so so here here&#39;s a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.629" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">thinking about it I taught you this your</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.149" end="00:27:05.379" style="s2">left hemisphere is really good for</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.519" style="s2">well-defined problems your right</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.379" end="00:27:09.399" style="s2">hemisphere is really good for</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.519" end="00:27:13.509" style="s2">ill-defined problems it&#39;s more like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.399" end="00:27:17.739" style="s2">okay so the left hemisphere works step</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.509" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">by step with individual detail the right</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.739" end="00:27:26.369" style="s2">hemisphere tries to work all at once</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:30.149" style="s2">right so what happens in insight</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.369" end="00:27:32.919" style="s2">processing starts on the left side</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.149" end="00:27:38.429" style="s2">because oh this is a familiar problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.919" end="00:27:42.119" style="s2">I&#39;m covering the chessboard oh crap</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.429" end="00:27:43.980" style="s2">and then activity shifts this is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.119" end="00:27:45.480" style="s2">cuneus and Beeman show it shifts</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.980" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">dramatically to the right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.480" end="00:27:49.889" style="s2">because now what you&#39;re doing is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">trying to solve the problem you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.889" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">trying to open up the gestalt you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:59.179" style="s2">trying to change the problem formulation</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:28:01.799" style="s2">and what happens is it goes with you and</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.179" end="00:28:04.230" style="s2">then it brings it back</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.799" end="00:28:06.450" style="s2">and the problem is reformulated that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.230" end="00:28:09.330" style="s2">insight there&#39;s the Eureka factor is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.450" end="00:28:11.669" style="s2">book if you want to read about this now</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.330" end="00:28:15.029" style="s2">here&#39;s where it gets interesting so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.669" end="00:28:17.100" style="s2">have a technology again we need to get</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.029" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">the theoretical precision we don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.100" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">know why it works</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:22.830" style="s2">it&#39;s called transcranial direct current</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.570" style="s2">stimulation you basically get two</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.830" end="00:28:26.369" style="s2">electrodes attached them to a 9-volt</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.570" end="00:28:30.179" style="s2">battery and run a current across it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.369" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">sounds like voodoo but what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.179" end="00:28:34.259" style="s2">it actually helps the brain shift</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.610" end="00:28:36.539" style="s2">patterns of activity again we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.259" end="00:28:38.639" style="s2">how or why it&#39;s strange but the result</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.539" end="00:28:42.179" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of evidence that it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.639" end="00:28:48.929" style="s2">this so guy by the name of chai and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.179" end="00:28:51.179" style="s2">Snider basically put the electrodes on</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.929" end="00:28:53.940" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s designed to try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.179" end="00:28:57.570" style="s2">enhance people shifting getting a shift</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.940" end="00:28:59.100" style="s2">from the left to right hemisphere and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.570" end="00:29:02.940" style="s2">found that that tripled people&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.100" end="00:29:04.860" style="s2">to solve insight problems and then they</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.940" end="00:29:06.179" style="s2">did something I didn&#39;t actually show you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.860" end="00:29:07.289" style="s2">there&#39;s called the nine dot problem</p>

<p begin="00:30:07.169" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">right now we have to do it by wire but</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.090" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">we always figure out how to do things by</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:16.230" style="s2">what why are wirelessly do you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:24.809" style="s2">governments and corporations to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.230" end="00:30:26.309" style="s2">that so I&#39;ve made an argument that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.809" end="00:30:28.980" style="s2">need to do something we haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.309" end="00:30:31.529" style="s2">before we need to make at public policy</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.980" end="00:30:33.419" style="s2">we need to have a cultural thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.529" end="00:30:35.429" style="s2">these emergent technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.419" end="00:30:40.440" style="s2">explicitly linked to the project of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.429" end="00:30:43.620" style="s2">making people wiser so that for once we</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.440" end="00:30:46.470" style="s2">can generate the wisdom of how to use</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.620" end="00:30:48.570" style="s2">the technology and specially link that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.470" end="00:30:52.590" style="s2">use to always making us wiser in the use</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.570" end="00:30:59.669" style="s2">of it we can actually do that now we</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.590" end="00:31:01.529" style="s2">have that potential so I think we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.669" end="00:31:12.210" style="s2">a race I&#39;ve been approached by the US</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.529" end="00:31:14.360" style="s2">government actually the US Army I said</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.210" end="00:31:14.360" style="s2">No</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:20.899" style="s2">I gave a talk on Saturday about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.929" end="00:31:23.149" style="s2">weird kind of cognition that we you the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.899" end="00:31:24.590" style="s2">scientists on earth use in order to use</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.149" end="00:31:26.419" style="s2">the Rovers on Mars and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.590" end="00:31:28.429" style="s2">strange and maybe you&#39;ll get to see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.419" end="00:31:29.750" style="s2">talk and I had somebody she came up to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.429" end="00:31:31.460" style="s2">me and she said oh that was such a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.750" end="00:31:38.299" style="s2">talk I want to know more about your work</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.460" end="00:31:39.799" style="s2">so I could better control drones so this</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.299" end="00:31:42.409" style="s2">is a long answer far beyond what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.799" end="00:31:44.090" style="s2">were asking for but I&#39;m trying to show</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.409" end="00:31:45.580" style="s2">you that first of all your point about</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.090" end="00:31:48.740" style="s2">it being invoked that&#39;s a real issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.580" end="00:31:50.210" style="s2">secondly we are watching what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.740" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">happening in the brain when people are</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.210" end="00:31:54.980" style="s2">in insight and because we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:57.950" style="s2">getting a good theoretical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.980" end="00:32:00.140" style="s2">with the precision that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.950" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">putting power in our hands and like all</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.140" end="00:32:06.700" style="s2">power it&#39;s very dangerous okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:06.700" style="s2">my answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:28.210" style="s2">but I I want to thank you John thank you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.850" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">for blowing our minds for for bringing</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.210" end="00:32:33.250" style="s2">some it for making us feel that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:36.790" style="s2">not alone in the feelings that we all</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.250" end="00:32:41.170" style="s2">have many of us are grandparents</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.790" end="00:32:43.390" style="s2">and think about our children and think</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.170" end="00:32:46.150" style="s2">about the world that they&#39;re moving into</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.390" end="00:32:50.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a pleasant thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:54.520" style="s2">to ponder but I think if they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.160" end="00:32:56.590" style="s2">taught the way you taught us today they</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.520" end="00:32:57.100" style="s2">might be better able to handle it I hope</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.590" end="00:32:59.680" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.100" end="00:33:04.180" style="s2">I think I think that would be our our</p>

<p begin="00:33:16.630" end="00:33:21.820" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.710" end="00:33:25.390" style="s2">it never stops as long as we allow it to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.820" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">continue so you have certainly taught us</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.390" end="00:33:33.420" style="s2">well today and given us much to think</p>
