<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:16.619" style="s2">lot about voting with my dollar for</p>

<p begin="00:00:16.619" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">justice and so I try not to buy things</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.189" end="00:00:24.920" style="s2">with palm oil and I try to buy things</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.930" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">that are organic and that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.920" end="00:00:31.560" style="s2">ingredients that I don&#39;t know what they</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">are that&#39;s made a lot harder when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:35.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the ingredients are and</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:39.620" style="s2">things sound scary that aren&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.760" end="00:00:43.579" style="s2">things that are scary are now labeled</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.620" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">benevolent whatever they&#39;re labeled more</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.579" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">benign and ice and and so having a way</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">to look beyond the branding and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:57.390" style="s2">similar these some of these things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:00:59.370" style="s2">I will be talking about exist in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.390" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">world but they&#39;re not owned by everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.370" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">and so therefore they aren&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:10.110" style="s2">open and transparent or they could be be</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">made much better by the crowd so an app</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.110" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">does exist I have it that I can scan the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">UPC of an item and it will tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">general health ethical and social score</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:23.580" style="s2">it has and we&#39;ll break that down a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">little bit but I can&#39;t if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.580" end="00:01:28.619" style="s2">have it I can&#39;t add it I can&#39;t see and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s very easy to say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.619" end="00:01:32.549" style="s2">this ingredient gets a certain score and</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">people can just add the ingredient you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.549" end="00:01:39.869" style="s2">can take a picture of the item take a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">picture the ingredient list and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.869" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">technology can read what the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:46.770" style="s2">are or in version 1.0 you actually type</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">in with the ingredient is as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.770" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">country you bought it in because I know</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:53.210" style="s2">the same product in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">is going to have different ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.210" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">and so figuring out without information</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s lots of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">can do this kind of hard because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">talking about brain stuff but I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:08.759" style="s2">to talk about it from my heart and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:11.379" style="s2">why why a product or than how I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.759" end="00:02:14.829" style="s2">to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.379" end="00:02:17.209" style="s2">it helps people who have allergies</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.829" end="00:02:19.640" style="s2">figure out what they can and can&#39;t eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.209" end="00:02:23.810" style="s2">more easily it helps us be able to vote</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.640" end="00:02:25.670" style="s2">with our dollar very efficiently because</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.810" end="00:02:27.739" style="s2">anyone can add any product it helps mom</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.670" end="00:02:29.329" style="s2">and pop organizations and local be able</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.739" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">to add and say hey you don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.329" end="00:02:33.170" style="s2">toothpaste it causes cancer how about</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:36.530" style="s2">you buy my stuff here you know it&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.170" end="00:02:38.540" style="s2">bucks a tube and you can bulk bulk make</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.530" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">it I make it you know whatever every</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.540" end="00:02:45.109" style="s2">other month get in on the next order you</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:47.299" style="s2">can have oh hi I mean I want that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.109" end="00:02:49.579" style="s2">knowledge I don&#39;t want to have to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.299" end="00:02:52.159" style="s2">up every ingredient every time isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.579" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">carcinogen is it an endocrine disruptor</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.159" end="00:02:57.379" style="s2">is it like I want to know I want to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:02:59.780" style="s2">able to filter it for me also maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.379" end="00:03:01.190" style="s2">not that like if I am allowed to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.780" end="00:03:03.139" style="s2">peanuts be able to say nothing with</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.190" end="00:03:04.909" style="s2">peanuts if I&#39;m a vegan nothing that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.139" end="00:03:05.959" style="s2">ever tested on animals and I think if</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.909" end="00:03:09.769" style="s2">you&#39;re not a vegan that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.959" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2">good call but then I can say oh this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.769" end="00:03:15.109" style="s2">corporation just supported a candidate</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">that I don&#39;t like I would like to stop</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.109" end="00:03:19.609" style="s2">buying all their stuff what does that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.349" style="s2">actually mean because it&#39;s like this one</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.609" end="00:03:23.930" style="s2">company owns all these other subsidiary</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.349" end="00:03:27.019" style="s2">companies and vice versa and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.930" end="00:03:32.359" style="s2">confusing and I can see that more</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.019" end="00:03:34.849" style="s2">clearly so once we&#39;re able to see beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.359" end="00:03:37.579" style="s2">the branding the power goes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.849" end="00:03:40.010" style="s2">consumer and to make that easy for</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.579" end="00:03:42.109" style="s2">people so you simply take a picture with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.010" end="00:03:44.650" style="s2">you PC or you eventually hopefully just</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.109" end="00:03:47.239" style="s2">take a picture of the product itself and</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.650" end="00:03:48.859" style="s2">eventually that goes on to being able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.239" end="00:03:52.160" style="s2">save that information so here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.859" end="00:03:54.349" style="s2">grocery list here&#39;s my and as we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.160" end="00:03:56.209" style="s2">to connect with our neighbors and people</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.349" end="00:03:57.970" style="s2">in our area you can say hey you and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.209" end="00:04:00.620" style="s2">other purse</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.060" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">that don&#39;t have peanuts for you because</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.220" end="00:04:11.139" style="s2">these ten people in the city all have</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:14.090" style="s2">kids with severe peanut allergies and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.139" end="00:04:17.180" style="s2">you use whatever you can use the math</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.090" end="00:04:20.150" style="s2">and the data to better serve us as</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.180" end="00:04:23.020" style="s2">consumers I hate the word consumers but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.150" end="00:04:24.970" style="s2">we all are who do consume things there</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.020" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">things we need to consume and things we</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.970" end="00:04:28.300" style="s2">don&#39;t need to consume but food is one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:31.509" style="s2">those things that we do need to get soon</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.300" end="00:04:35.460" style="s2">and with our lives it&#39;s stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.509" end="00:04:38.740" style="s2">packaged it&#39;s definitely you know loved</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.460" end="00:04:43.569" style="s2">and this is going to be on my five</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.740" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">minute limit per Apple so yeah Apple</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.569" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">number three is the product app so being</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:52.960" style="s2">able to easily see the ingredients and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">the ethics behind the products that we</p>
