<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">think mostly because on some level</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.020" end="00:00:28.349" style="s2">you&#39;ve been too busy doing Plato great</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">like like yeah because we so often we</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:49.079" style="s2">reading right but then we we become we</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.289" end="00:00:50.460" style="s2">become very distracted yeah and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.079" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">follow things where they may which i</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.460" end="00:00:52.140" style="s2">think is right I think it&#39;s right that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:54.239" style="s2">we do that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.140" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s also nice to return yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">so speaking of returning let&#39;s so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">on page 590 in the Alka beatty&#39;s chapter</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:08.369" style="s2">and I&#39;ll I there&#39;s a link I&#39;ll include</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">to this to this collected volumes and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.369" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">will start as Alka babies now cab ad</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:19.970" style="s2">says you&#39;re right great thanks end of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:22.280" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.970" end="00:01:29.549" style="s2">after all that&#39;s what matters right</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.280" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">that&#39;s right okay if being self</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.549" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">controlled is knowing yourself then</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">their skills don&#39;t make any of them self</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:39.689" style="s2">controlled I don&#39;t think so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">we consider these skills to be beneath</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.689" end="00:01:47.090" style="s2">us and not suitable for a gentleman to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:49.380" style="s2">learn you&#39;re quite right again further</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.090" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">furthermore if someone takes care of his</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.380" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">body then isn&#39;t he caring for something</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:57.509" style="s2">that belongs to him and not for himself</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">seems likely and isn&#39;t someone who takes</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.509" end="00:02:01.350" style="s2">care of his wealth carrying neither for</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">himself nor for what belongs to him but</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.350" end="00:02:07.950" style="s2">for something even further away and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:12.230" style="s2">agree so the money earner is not in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.950" end="00:02:14.540" style="s2">doing his own work right again</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.230" end="00:02:16.109" style="s2">now if there was someone who loved</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.540" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">alcibiades body</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.109" end="00:02:19.829" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t be loving Alcibiades only</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:23.489" style="s2">something that belonged to our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.829" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">that&#39;s right but someone who loved you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.489" end="00:02:34.439" style="s2">would love your soul by our argument I</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:37.829" style="s2">think he&#39;d have to wouldn&#39;t somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.439" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t someone who loves your body go</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.829" end="00:02:44.609" style="s2">off and leave you when your beauty is no</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:46.079" style="s2">longer in full bloom obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.609" end="00:02:47.970" style="s2">someone who loves your soul will not</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.079" end="00:02:53.549" style="s2">leave you as long as you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.970" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">progress that&#39;s probably right well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.549" end="00:02:59.129" style="s2">the one who won&#39;t leave you I&#39;m the one</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">who will stay with you now that your</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.129" end="00:03:02.609" style="s2">body has lost its bloom and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:04.470" style="s2">else has gone away</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.609" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">all right let&#39;s pause I just wanna pause</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.470" end="00:03:11.909" style="s2">right there a backhanded compliment if</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:14.099" style="s2">there ever was one</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.909" end="00:03:15.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not a compliment at all but a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.099" end="00:03:18.540" style="s2">backhanded consolation I supposed</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.650" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2">totally so this kind of get I think this</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.540" end="00:03:25.889" style="s2">is this is this points to something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:28.530" style="s2">this is this socrates here&#39;s a moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.889" end="00:03:31.409" style="s2">where Socrates is revealing what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.530" end="00:03:33.720" style="s2">doing right like where he discloses</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.409" end="00:03:37.709" style="s2">himself and he points to like what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.720" end="00:03:39.629" style="s2">doing and you kind of get this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.709" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">all of these circles that he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.629" end="00:03:44.609" style="s2">running him through and kind of torching</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.609" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">and over again he&#39;s like it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.959" end="00:03:51.239" style="s2">this is one of those moments where he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.430" end="00:07:28.650" style="s2">pulling in the common right and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.080" end="00:07:30.259" style="s2">it&#39;s basically and if you go to the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.650" end="00:07:33.900" style="s2">in the common they can make you ugly</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.259" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">right but I&#39;m seeing what is most</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.900" end="00:07:42.539" style="s2">beautiful in you yet unbloomed and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take something beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.539" end="00:07:50.190" style="s2">you that to the training to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:53.279" style="s2">bloom it right yes that&#39;s right right</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.190" end="00:07:56.009" style="s2">that&#39;s right and then as a primer before</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.279" end="00:07:58.009" style="s2">entering into a political arena this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.009" end="00:08:01.500" style="s2">very significant to right because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.009" end="00:08:03.240" style="s2">ultimately what he is trying to dispose</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.500" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">in this relationship the love and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.240" end="00:08:07.310" style="s2">attention and caring for the soul that</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to provoke our bodies into</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.310" end="00:08:14.610" style="s2">should prefigure any foray into</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:17.669" style="s2">something less than ultimate something</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.610" end="00:08:19.169" style="s2">that engages Alcibiades at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.669" end="00:08:21.029" style="s2">his possessions at the level of his</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.169" end="00:08:22.800" style="s2">identity that is subordinate to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.029" end="00:08:27.029" style="s2">identity of the soul that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.800" end="00:08:29.129" style="s2">trying to stoke and so he&#39;s prefiguring</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.029" end="00:08:32.190" style="s2">the boundaries of the arena in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.129" end="00:08:34.199" style="s2">Alcibiades will enter into play in order</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.190" end="00:08:36.899" style="s2">that Alcibiades does not mistake</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.199" end="00:08:39.360" style="s2">the arena and the game he&#39;s playing for</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.899" end="00:08:40.949" style="s2">anything more ultimate than it is right</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.360" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">so it&#39;s almost like he&#39;s giving him a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.949" end="00:08:44.790" style="s2">view of the landscape into which he will</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:47.610" style="s2">now venture so that he doesn&#39;t lose</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.790" end="00:08:50.010" style="s2">himself within it when he enters it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.610" end="00:08:51.420" style="s2">that he can be Ricky can retrieve and be</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.010" end="00:08:54.030" style="s2">retrieved from it</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.420" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">properly he&#39;s warning ya it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.030" end="00:08:59.930" style="s2">like Socrates is warning him and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.690" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">initiating him in a non idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.930" end="00:09:07.610" style="s2">precisely like and on some level he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:12.390" style="s2">got to give up everything that&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.610" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">right to realize maybe what can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.390" end="00:09:17.910" style="s2">be seen on some level right trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:21.300" style="s2">trained and he&#39;s got to be trained in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.910" end="00:09:25.440" style="s2">the ability to do that because if not</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.300" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">then the agent arena right relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.440" end="00:09:30.480" style="s2">itself process won&#39;t it&#39;ll be all</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:33.420" style="s2">participation with no individuation</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.480" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">right or or the individual the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.420" end="00:09:38.280" style="s2">individual will be an inauthentic one</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">closed in the house like in the close of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.280" end="00:09:45.470" style="s2">the Commons just given by what they want</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:47.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s a kind in the sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.470" end="00:09:50.070" style="s2">participation the tillich sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.550" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">participation and the individuation and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:55.470" style="s2">so Socrates saying hold that tension in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">fact you&#39;re not ready for that tension</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.470" end="00:10:02.970" style="s2">yeah go and like find something that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:07.110" style="s2">can&#39;t actually grasp right that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.970" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">don&#39;t go into images basically sorry huh</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.110" end="00:10:11.520" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">so that this his identity relation</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.520" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">always remains straddling between what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">inside of the boundaries of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">politicking of the game he&#39;s played and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:23.610" style="s2">part of it always remains outside the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.560" style="s2">bar right it&#39;s like a transforming</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.610" end="00:10:28.320" style="s2">exercise understanding that his the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.560" end="00:10:30.660" style="s2">composure of his identity has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.320" end="00:10:33.030" style="s2">straddle the in the interior and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.660" end="00:10:35.010" style="s2">exterior boundaries of the frame rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.030" end="00:10:38.300" style="s2">than to be enveloped by them entirely</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.010" end="00:10:41.750" style="s2">and so Socrates sort of assess is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.300" end="00:10:43.950" style="s2">maintaining attention of his perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.750" end="00:10:46.200" style="s2">maintaining a presence of his</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.950" end="00:10:48.420" style="s2">perspective outside the boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.200" end="00:10:51.870" style="s2">in then in the tension between what is</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.420" end="00:10:56.070" style="s2">inside and what is outside maintaining a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.870" end="00:11:00.900" style="s2">tether on his soul and that&#39;s it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.070" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">like Socrates in some ways loss is</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.900" end="00:11:05.280" style="s2">loving that part in him he&#39;s loving it</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:06.930" style="s2">right and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.280" end="00:11:10.170" style="s2">saying that&#39;s the most beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.930" end="00:11:12.270" style="s2">and I think what what I&#39;m getting is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.170" end="00:11:15.690" style="s2">sense of and maybe and maybe if we like</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.270" end="00:11:18.270" style="s2">look at what the soul is and this it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.690" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s that which is in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.270" end="00:11:24.150" style="s2">straddling really it&#39;s connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:29.330" style="s2">continuity of all those things so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.150" end="00:11:32.610" style="s2">like Socrates loves his soul right</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.330" end="00:11:33.810" style="s2">basically he&#39;s saying I&#39;m gonna like as</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.610" end="00:11:37.950" style="s2">that blossoms</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.810" end="00:11:39.660" style="s2">it&#39;ll blossom in like right relationship</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.950" end="00:11:42.990" style="s2">as you&#39;re describing here that thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.660" end="00:11:46.440" style="s2">that&#39;s parents that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.990" end="00:11:48.240" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly exactly it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.440" end="00:11:49.830" style="s2">saying what Socrates loves the more of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.240" end="00:11:52.260" style="s2">him that&#39;s now dawning into</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.830" end="00:11:57.080" style="s2">consciousness as a consequence of having</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.260" end="00:12:00.690" style="s2">lost all of those all of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.080" end="00:12:02.790" style="s2">frivolities by which he constituted his</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.690" end="00:12:06.090" style="s2">identity before the fact of this</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.790" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">dialogue and he&#39;s also saying like it by</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.090" end="00:12:11.790" style="s2">the way since I&#39;m taking one for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:17.900" style="s2">team trying to look good to try to stay</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.790" end="00:12:17.900" style="s2">pretty it&#39;s not gonna matter ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.790" end="00:12:28.200" style="s2">yeah you bet yeah you bet you bet okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.290" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">so this I think you&#39;re right Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.200" end="00:12:37.860" style="s2">that is that where we are yes it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:41.190" style="s2">I think you&#39;re right Socrates but try to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.860" end="00:12:45.660" style="s2">explain how exactly we should cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.190" end="00:12:47.640" style="s2">ourselves well we&#39;ve made one step</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.660" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">forward anyway we&#39;ve pretty well agreed</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.640" end="00:12:51.960" style="s2">what we are we were afraid that we might</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:53.820" style="s2">make a mistake about that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.960" end="00:12:57.690" style="s2">unwittingly cultivate something other</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.820" end="00:12:59.339" style="s2">than ourselves that which I think which</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.690" end="00:13:01.620" style="s2">I think is that the right that returns</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.339" end="00:13:03.420" style="s2">us to the point right which is that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.620" end="00:13:10.680" style="s2">wants to be sure that whatever is being</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.420" end="00:13:13.500" style="s2">cultivated here is is is is the self</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.680" end="00:13:17.100" style="s2">that can no itself has more yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.500" end="00:13:18.990" style="s2">what it then what is prescribed of it by</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.100" end="00:13:22.339" style="s2">the particular parameters</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.990" end="00:13:25.529" style="s2">of its exercise in the confines of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.339" end="00:13:29.130" style="s2">athenian activity rehearsais right right</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.529" end="00:13:33.510" style="s2">that&#39;s the self that must be regathered</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.130" end="00:13:36.589" style="s2">right and and throughout this whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.510" end="00:13:39.450" style="s2">thing he&#39;s exemplified how you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.589" end="00:13:41.820" style="s2">unwittingly cultivate something other</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.450" end="00:13:43.260" style="s2">than ourselves that&#39;s right right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.820" end="00:13:45.450" style="s2">you could be it&#39;s filled with</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.260" end="00:13:48.510" style="s2">self-deception right it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.450" end="00:13:50.790" style="s2">try to or think you are and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.510" end="00:13:53.209" style="s2">very thing that&#39;s trying keeps you from</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.790" end="00:13:57.480" style="s2">noticing that you aren&#39;t at all right</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.209" end="00:14:03.089" style="s2">huh and alka by Jesus is the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.480" end="00:14:05.100" style="s2">that&#39;s right that&#39;s right and the next</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.089" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">step is that we have to cultivate our</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.100" end="00:14:13.830" style="s2">soul and look to that obviously and let</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:19.020" style="s2">others take care of our bodies and our</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.830" end="00:14:22.050" style="s2">property quite so now how can we get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.020" end="00:14:24.180" style="s2">clearest knowledge of our soul if we</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.050" end="00:14:26.550" style="s2">knew that we&#39;d probably know ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.180" end="00:14:28.470" style="s2">as well by the guards that admirable</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.550" end="00:14:32.010" style="s2">Delphic inscription we just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.470" end="00:14:36.089" style="s2">didn&#39;t we understand it what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.010" end="00:14:37.649" style="s2">of bringing that up again Socrates I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.089" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">tell you what I suspect to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.649" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">inscription means and what advice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:45.810" style="s2">giving us there may not be many examples</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:50.070" style="s2">of it except the case of sight what do</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.810" end="00:14:52.170" style="s2">you mean by that you think about it too</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.070" end="00:14:55.529" style="s2">if the inscription took our eyes to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.170" end="00:14:57.170" style="s2">men and advised them see thyself how</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.529" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">would we understand such advice</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:15:01.220" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t the eye be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:05.399" style="s2">something in which you could see itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.220" end="00:15:08.000" style="s2">obviously then let&#39;s think of something</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.399" end="00:15:11.910" style="s2">that allows us to see both it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.000" end="00:15:13.230" style="s2">ourselves when we look at it all right</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.910" end="00:15:16.230" style="s2">here&#39;s where the Socratic self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.230" end="00:15:18.829" style="s2">starts to become really definitional</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.230" end="00:15:24.089" style="s2">really definitional here yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.829" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">obviously Socrates you mean mirrors and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.089" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">that sort of thing quite right and isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:32.580" style="s2">there something like that in the eye</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:37.300" style="s2">which we see with</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.580" end="00:15:39.430" style="s2">certainly I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.300" end="00:15:42.520" style="s2">when a man looks into an eye his face</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.430" end="00:15:44.620" style="s2">appears in it like in a mirror we call</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.520" end="00:15:46.800" style="s2">this the pupil 4 it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.620" end="00:15:51.100" style="s2">miniature of the man who&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.800" end="00:15:53.920" style="s2">you&#39;re right then and I will see itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.100" end="00:15:56.230" style="s2">is if it observes an eye and looks at</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.920" end="00:16:01.330" style="s2">the best part of it the part which it</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.230" end="00:16:03.250" style="s2">can see see so it seems but it won&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.330" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">itself if it looks at anything else in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.250" end="00:16:09.550" style="s2">man or anything else at all unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">similar to the eye you&#39;re right so if an</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.550" end="00:16:16.120" style="s2">eye is to see itself it must look at an</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.830" end="00:16:17.470" style="s2">eye and at that region of it in which</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.120" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">the good activity of an eye actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.470" end="00:16:23.670" style="s2">occurs and this I presume is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.670" end="00:16:29.080" style="s2">then if the sole of IDs is to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:32.230" style="s2">itself it must look at a soul and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.080" end="00:16:34.750" style="s2">especially at that region in which what</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.230" end="00:16:36.670" style="s2">makes a good soul sorry let me take this</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.750" end="00:16:39.340" style="s2">again then if a soul then if the soul</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.670" end="00:16:40.900" style="s2">also by D&#39;s is to know itself it must</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.340" end="00:16:42.760" style="s2">look at a soul and especially at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.900" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">region in which what makes a soul good</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.760" end="00:16:51.280" style="s2">wisdom occurs and that anything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:54.190" style="s2">which is similar to it ok so what I read</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.280" end="00:16:58.270" style="s2">that that line could very well be I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.190" end="00:17:00.070" style="s2">think that mean that&#39;s a that&#39;s as good</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.270" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">a definition for D logos as there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.070" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">yeah yeah let&#39;s read write that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.620" end="00:17:08.020" style="s2">right then I mean this entire sequence</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:10.209" style="s2">but even just that line yeah and if the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.020" end="00:17:12.220" style="s2">soul Alcibiades is to know itself it</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.209" end="00:17:14.680" style="s2">must look at a soul and especially at</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.220" end="00:17:17.650" style="s2">that region in which what makes a soul</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.680" end="00:17:20.459" style="s2">good wisdom occurs and at anything else</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.650" end="00:17:24.339" style="s2">which is similar to it it must like it</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.459" end="00:17:27.670" style="s2">lykan to it yeah and witness itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.339" end="00:17:30.550" style="s2">emerging in the reflection of what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.670" end="00:17:33.310" style="s2">good right right Italy known by it</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.550" end="00:17:34.750" style="s2">totally even with even the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.310" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">like it&#39;s like there&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.750" end="00:17:39.790" style="s2">that&#39;s really shows this way in which</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">wisdom is not possessive all right but</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.790" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s in the relational</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.309" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">responsiveness of looking at at us like</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.340" end="00:17:54.460" style="s2">looking at that which you see it and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:58.510" style="s2">see yourself transparent to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.460" end="00:18:00.730" style="s2">at the same time right yes yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.510" end="00:18:06.760" style="s2">right that&#39;s sort of like that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.730" end="00:18:09.850" style="s2">it&#39;s a way of it&#39;s a way of in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.760" end="00:18:14.500" style="s2">you being disclosed in me I am</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.850" end="00:18:18.039" style="s2">simultaneously disclosed to you and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.500" end="00:18:19.480" style="s2">myself right yes right that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.039" end="00:18:21.549" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why I think of it I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.480" end="00:18:22.870" style="s2">mean the word transparent it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.549" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">now and again when we talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.870" end="00:18:25.809" style="s2">but I think a bit more that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.159" end="00:18:27.490" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this before I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.809" end="00:18:29.799" style="s2">of it more as more as more of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.490" end="00:18:34.600" style="s2">translucency because you&#39;re both you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.799" end="00:18:36.460" style="s2">both seeing the you&#39;re both seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.600" end="00:18:38.830" style="s2">sight organ and you&#39;re seeing by means</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.460" end="00:18:41.470" style="s2">of the site organ simultaneously all</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.830" end="00:18:43.030" style="s2">right and that&#39;s why you&#39;re both I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.470" end="00:18:44.890" style="s2">that&#39;s why they did the combined</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.030" end="00:18:46.780" style="s2">integration and differentiation come</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.890" end="00:18:49.510" style="s2">from well cisely because of that trend</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.780" end="00:18:51.690" style="s2">it&#39;s loose yeah yeah you&#39;re not you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.510" end="00:18:55.030" style="s2">not simply seeing through to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.690" end="00:18:57.880" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing what is seeing in addition</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.030" end="00:18:59.140" style="s2">to be holding it&#39;s beholden right and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.880" end="00:19:02.590" style="s2">think that&#39;s right that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.140" end="00:19:06.549" style="s2">significant here I also I mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.590" end="00:19:07.659" style="s2">the top of the page when Socrates says</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.549" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">you know I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.659" end="00:19:10.510" style="s2">when a man looks into an eye his face</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:12.850" style="s2">appears in it like a mirror we call this</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.510" end="00:19:16.270" style="s2">the pupil I mean I can&#39;t help but enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.850" end="00:19:19.150" style="s2">the double meaning of people - yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.270" end="00:19:20.830" style="s2">absolutely and then yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.150" end="00:19:22.600" style="s2">perspective speaks a whole lot unto</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.830" end="00:19:25.480" style="s2">itself right and in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.600" end="00:19:26.470" style="s2">Socrates is bringing him up to peer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.480" end="00:19:29.110" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.470" end="00:19:32.289" style="s2">right it&#39;s writing peers that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.110" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">right that&#39;s right that&#39;s right well the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.289" end="00:19:39.010" style="s2">people comes to peer yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:41.640" style="s2">and I&#39;ll Kabaddi says and I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.010" end="00:19:41.640" style="s2">you Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.020" end="00:19:48.029" style="s2">I think I&#39;ve lost the plot here guy</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.130" end="00:19:50.370" style="s2">where are we again</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.029" end="00:19:54.840" style="s2">oh we&#39;re like yeah so you just wrote oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.370" end="00:19:56.549" style="s2">I got it I got it yeah I got it can we</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.840" end="00:19:59.100" style="s2">say that there is anything about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.549" end="00:20:01.909" style="s2">soul which is more divine than we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">knowing and understanding take place</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.909" end="00:20:07.470" style="s2">sorry I missed I missed a word there can</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.580" end="00:20:09.809" style="s2">we say that that there is anything about</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.470" end="00:20:11.549" style="s2">the soul which is more divine than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.809" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">where knowing and understanding take</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.549" end="00:20:19.799" style="s2">place no we can&#39;t then that region in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:21.750" style="s2">resembles the divine and someone who</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.799" end="00:20:24.809" style="s2">looked at that and grasped everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.750" end="00:20:27.020" style="s2">divine vision and understanding would</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.809" end="00:20:31.049" style="s2">have the best grasp of himself as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.020" end="00:20:32.549" style="s2">so it seems but we agreed that knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.049" end="00:20:36.450" style="s2">oneself was the same as being self</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.549" end="00:20:38.190" style="s2">controlled certainly so if we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.450" end="00:20:41.730" style="s2">ourselves and weren&#39;t self controlled</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.190" end="00:20:43.649" style="s2">would we be able to know which of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.730" end="00:20:46.710" style="s2">things that belong to us were good in</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.649" end="00:20:50.220" style="s2">which were bad how could we know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.710" end="00:20:53.279" style="s2">Socrates no I suppose it would seem</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.220" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">impossible to you to know that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.279" end="00:20:56.880" style="s2">belonged to know that what belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:21:00.090" style="s2">Alcibiades belongs to him without</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.880" end="00:21:03.480" style="s2">knowing us why he&#39;s quite impossible I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.090" end="00:21:04.940" style="s2">sure and similarly we couldn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.480" end="00:21:07.500" style="s2">belongs to us</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.940" end="00:21:09.510" style="s2">sorry and similarly we couldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:12.419" style="s2">that what belongs to us belongs to us</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.510" end="00:21:14.789" style="s2">without knowing ourselves how could we</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.419" end="00:21:16.529" style="s2">and if we didn&#39;t even know what belongs</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.789" end="00:21:17.909" style="s2">to us how could we possibly know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.529" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">belongs to our belongings</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.909" end="00:21:24.059" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t then it wasn&#39;t quite right</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.799" style="s2">to agree as we did a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.059" end="00:21:27.450" style="s2">that some people know what belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.799" end="00:21:29.220" style="s2">them without knowing themselves while</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.450" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">others know what belongs to their</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.220" end="00:21:33.960" style="s2">belongings it seems that it&#39;s the job of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:37.140" style="s2">one man and one skill to know all these</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.960" end="00:21:39.929" style="s2">things himself his belongings and his</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.140" end="00:21:43.409" style="s2">belongings belongings that seemed likely</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.929" end="00:21:45.690" style="s2">and it follows that anyone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.409" end="00:21:47.149" style="s2">know his own belongings probably won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.690" end="00:21:50.100" style="s2">know other people&#39;s belongings either</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.149" end="00:21:51.899" style="s2">quite so and if he doesn&#39;t know other</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.100" end="00:21:56.370" style="s2">people&#39;s belongings nor will he know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.899" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">belongs to the city he couldn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.370" end="00:22:01.830" style="s2">man couldn&#39;t become a statesman of</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.700" end="00:22:04.590" style="s2">course not nor could he even manage a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.830" end="00:22:06.630" style="s2">household estate of course not</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.590" end="00:22:09.420" style="s2">nor indeed will he know what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.630" end="00:22:10.140" style="s2">certainly not and if he doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.420" end="00:22:13.559" style="s2">what he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.140" end="00:22:15.000" style="s2">won&#39;t he make mistakes certainly since</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.559" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">he make mistakes won&#39;t he conduct</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.000" end="00:22:21.300" style="s2">himself badly both publicly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">privately of course since he conducts</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.300" end="00:22:26.160" style="s2">himself badly won&#39;t he be a failure</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:30.450" style="s2">absolutely what about the people he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.160" end="00:22:33.929" style="s2">working for they will I&#39;m sorry they</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.450" end="00:22:35.970" style="s2">will be too then it&#39;s impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.929" end="00:22:39.750" style="s2">anyone to prosper unless he is self</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.970" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">controlled and good impossible so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.750" end="00:22:44.610" style="s2">the bad men who are failures absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:47.640" style="s2">and so the way to avoid being a failure</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.610" end="00:22:54.600" style="s2">is not by getting rich but by being self</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.640" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">controlled apparently so it&#39;s not walls</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.600" end="00:23:00.090" style="s2">or warships you just make sure you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:01.890" style="s2">the right page there yes so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.090" end="00:23:03.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not walls or warships or shipyards</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.890" end="00:23:06.179" style="s2">that cities need I&#39;ll survive Iza fare</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.900" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">to prosper nor is it numbers or size</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.179" end="00:23:13.500" style="s2">without virtue definitely so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.830" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">to manage the city&#39;s business properly</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.500" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">and well you must impart virtue to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.770" end="00:23:25.590" style="s2">citizens is virtue of course is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">possible to impart something you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.590" end="00:23:31.230" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:33.179" style="s2">how could you then you or anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.230" end="00:23:34.830" style="s2">who is to be ruler and trusty not only</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.179" end="00:23:36.300" style="s2">of himself in his private business but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.830" end="00:23:39.270" style="s2">also the city in the city&#39;s business</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.300" end="00:23:41.760" style="s2">must first acquire virtue himself you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.270" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">right so what you need to get for</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:45.390" style="s2">yourself and for the city isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:48.179" style="s2">political power nor the authority to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.390" end="00:23:53.130" style="s2">what you like what you need is justice</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.179" end="00:23:54.840" style="s2">and self-control apparently because my</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.130" end="00:23:56.760" style="s2">dear Alcibiades when an individual or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.840" end="00:23:59.460" style="s2">city with no intelligence is at liberty</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.760" end="00:24:02.130" style="s2">to do what he or it wants what do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.460" end="00:24:03.929" style="s2">think a likely result will be for</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.130" end="00:24:05.370" style="s2">example if he&#39;s sick and has the power</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.929" end="00:24:07.410" style="s2">to do whatever he likes without any</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.370" end="00:24:09.580" style="s2">medical insight but with such a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.410" end="00:24:12.220" style="s2">dictators power that nobody criticizes</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.580" end="00:24:13.660" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen isn&#39;t it likely his</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.220" end="00:24:17.620" style="s2">health will be ruined</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.660" end="00:24:19.450" style="s2">you&#39;re right and in a ship if someone</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.620" end="00:24:21.340" style="s2">were free to do what you liked but was</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.450" end="00:24:22.870" style="s2">completely lacking an insight and skill</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.340" end="00:24:24.550" style="s2">and navigation don&#39;t you see what would</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.870" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">happen to him and his fellow sailors I</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.550" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">do indeed they would all die</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.880" end="00:24:34.630" style="s2">likewise anis likewise of a city or any</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.830" end="00:24:38.770" style="s2">ruler or administrator is lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.630" end="00:24:43.120" style="s2">virtue then bad conduct will result it</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.770" end="00:24:45.430" style="s2">must well then my good Alcibiades a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.120" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">are to prosper it isn&#39;t supreme power</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.430" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">you need to get for yourself or the city</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:54.610" style="s2">but virtue you&#39;re right but before one</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.120" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">acquires virtue it&#39;s better to be ruled</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.610" end="00:25:01.720" style="s2">by somebody superior than to rule the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:04.600" style="s2">supplies to man as well as to boys so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.720" end="00:25:09.280" style="s2">seems and isn&#39;t what is better</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.600" end="00:25:11.410" style="s2">also more admirable yes and isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.280" end="00:25:14.800" style="s2">is more admirable more appropriate of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.410" end="00:25:18.520" style="s2">course so it&#39;s appropriate for a bad man</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.800" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">to be a slave since it&#39;s better yes and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.520" end="00:25:24.100" style="s2">vice is appropriate for a slave</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:25.480" style="s2">apparently and virtue is appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.100" end="00:25:27.430" style="s2">a free man yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.480" end="00:25:30.130" style="s2">well my friend shouldn&#39;t we avoid</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.430" end="00:25:32.470" style="s2">whatever is appropriate for slaves yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.130" end="00:25:36.280" style="s2">as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.470" end="00:25:39.160" style="s2">Socrates can you see what condition</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.280" end="00:25:44.320" style="s2">you&#39;re now in is it appropriate for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.160" end="00:25:48.520" style="s2">free man or not I think I see only too</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.320" end="00:25:52.120" style="s2">clearly then do you know how to escape</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.520" end="00:25:57.720" style="s2">from your present state let&#39;s not call a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.120" end="00:26:01.660" style="s2">handsome young man by that name I do how</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.720" end="00:26:05.170" style="s2">it&#39;s up to you Socrates that&#39;s not well</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.660" end="00:26:06.530" style="s2">said I&#39;ll serve IDs well what should I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.170" end="00:26:12.440" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.530" end="00:26:16.540" style="s2">that it&#39;s up to God then that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.440" end="00:26:19.910" style="s2">say and furthermore I say this as well</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.540" end="00:26:22.940" style="s2">we&#39;re probably going to change roles</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.910" end="00:26:26.690" style="s2">Socrates I&#39;ll be playing yours and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:30.770" style="s2">you&#39;ll be playing mine for from this day</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.690" end="00:26:34.250" style="s2">forward I will never fail to attend to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.770" end="00:26:41.870" style="s2">attend on you and you will always have</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.250" end="00:26:44.690" style="s2">me as your attendant and my love for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.870" end="00:26:48.050" style="s2">my excellent friend will be just like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.690" end="00:26:52.090" style="s2">stork after hatching a winged love in</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.050" end="00:26:55.870" style="s2">you it will be cared for by it in return</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.090" end="00:27:00.530" style="s2">yes that&#39;s right I&#39;ll start to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.870" end="00:27:01.880" style="s2">justice in myself right now I should</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.530" end="00:27:03.920" style="s2">like to believe that you will preserve</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.880" end="00:27:05.960" style="s2">sorry I would like to believe that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.920" end="00:27:07.220" style="s2">will persevere but I&#39;m afraid not</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.960" end="00:27:09.170" style="s2">because I just trust your nature but</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.220" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">because I know how powerful the city is</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.170" end="00:27:18.560" style="s2">and the fruit it might get the better of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:21.050" style="s2">both me and you Wow well I think just</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.560" end="00:27:22.910" style="s2">right in those in that part like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.050" end="00:27:28.430" style="s2">last part that we read I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.910" end="00:27:31.250" style="s2">starting to get the the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.430" end="00:27:33.560" style="s2">the wisdom of the order actually hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.250" end="00:27:35.270" style="s2">right because it just seems to set so</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.560" end="00:27:37.160" style="s2">many things up right you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.270" end="00:27:40.160" style="s2">reading order yeah the reading yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.160" end="00:27:42.710" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah yeah well because</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.160" end="00:27:45.050" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it yeah isn&#39;t it telling that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.710" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">it begins or sorry rather concludes with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.050" end="00:27:49.280" style="s2">a with an open-ended proposal yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:50.990" style="s2">not a proposition but a probe by John</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.280" end="00:27:51.920" style="s2">makes this distinction often right I</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.990" end="00:27:53.300" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good distinction the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.920" end="00:27:55.430" style="s2">proposal that&#39;s the deed and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.300" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">proposition that&#39;s the speech being it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.430" end="00:28:01.220" style="s2">ends with the proposal a proposal it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:01.940" style="s2">covenant &#39;el proposal almost a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.220" end="00:28:05.420" style="s2">commitment</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.940" end="00:28:06.980" style="s2">yeah and and also by the very end he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.420" end="00:28:09.950" style="s2">like any seriously saying and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.980" end="00:28:12.620" style="s2">probably not gonna stay in a veil yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.950" end="00:28:14.720" style="s2">which like says to like speak it places</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.620" end="00:28:17.870" style="s2">in the right aspirational spec place</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.720" end="00:28:20.110" style="s2">right right like that&#39;s right like it</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.870" end="00:28:21.850" style="s2">mostly admits of like the whoa</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.110" end="00:28:24.040" style="s2">ones who would do this aren&#39;t the ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.850" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">talking right now right they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.040" end="00:28:30.130" style="s2">that could be yeah yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:33.549" style="s2">that&#39;s right so interesting how it just</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.130" end="00:28:35.799" style="s2">kept it&#39;s like it both kept tithing</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.549" end="00:28:39.690" style="s2">tightening up the circle kept tightening</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.799" end="00:28:42.370" style="s2">up but also pointing to more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.690" end="00:28:43.929" style="s2">the center being everywhere right this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.370" end="00:28:45.929" style="s2">sense right I really got this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.929" end="00:28:48.070" style="s2">the dot that the dialectic between</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.929" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">especially at the end whereas like</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.070" end="00:28:56.440" style="s2">between the thing that Socrates loves in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:29:01.090" style="s2">Alcibiades right right is not the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.440" end="00:29:02.950" style="s2">is not the city right it&#39;s like no he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.090" end="00:29:06.220" style="s2">got a it&#39;s the thing he&#39;s loving is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.950" end="00:29:08.860" style="s2">thing that needs to be educated right to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.220" end="00:29:12.280" style="s2">be a self that and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.860" end="00:29:16.960" style="s2">interesting it to be a self that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.280" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">called by virtue right not by any the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.960" end="00:29:22.510" style="s2">like the not by any the mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">you can kind of normally just you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.510" end="00:29:26.799" style="s2">take to be a city right but what its</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:28.660" style="s2">gonna take to be the city is a virtue</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.799" end="00:29:31.750" style="s2">so like that comically it opens up about</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.660" end="00:29:36.270" style="s2">virtue there to that&#39;s right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.750" end="00:29:39.340" style="s2">right that&#39;s right and and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.270" end="00:29:46.030" style="s2">the home that they&#39;re trying to mutually</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.340" end="00:29:50.070" style="s2">make in virtue is held is is is held and</p>

<p begin="00:29:57.549" end="00:30:01.660" style="s2">or another it always returns again and</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.660" end="00:30:06.400" style="s2">very beginning and then again somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.960" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">in the middle and then again here at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.400" end="00:30:13.780" style="s2">end it always returns to the the re</p>

<p begin="00:30:13.780" end="00:30:20.140" style="s2">thing that will anchor their</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.919" end="00:30:24.150" style="s2">correspondence to the virtue that</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">there it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.040" end="00:30:38.900" style="s2">their affinity that draws them back into</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">virtue when everything else will</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.900" end="00:30:45.050" style="s2">threaten to undermine it right right</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:47.330" style="s2">that&#39;s the speaking it&#39;s the speaking</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.050" end="00:30:53.030" style="s2">into one another yeah that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.330" end="00:30:56.360" style="s2">recollect the presence that knows their</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.030" end="00:30:57.470" style="s2">mutual identities in virtue of each</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.360" end="00:30:59.690" style="s2">other right</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.470" end="00:31:01.910" style="s2">and like Alka Betty&#39;s even says at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.690" end="00:31:07.040" style="s2">very the last thing he says what was it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:09.230" style="s2">like he said and cultivate justice and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.040" end="00:31:12.200" style="s2">myself right now he said right in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.230" end="00:31:15.770" style="s2">part before that where he says well then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.200" end="00:31:18.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what I say and furthermore I say</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.770" end="00:31:22.190" style="s2">this as well we&#39;re probably going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.800" end="00:31:25.790" style="s2">change roles right that just that sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.190" end="00:31:28.550" style="s2">of presencing again it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.790" end="00:31:32.720" style="s2">presencing that you know who is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.550" end="00:31:34.610" style="s2">character Socrates right yeah like like</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.720" end="00:31:37.730" style="s2">there it shows like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.610" end="00:31:40.190" style="s2">interchangeability right of the roles of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.730" end="00:31:42.710" style="s2">like maybe one can be handed over to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.190" end="00:31:46.310" style="s2">other right that this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.710" end="00:31:48.860" style="s2">isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t in me it isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.310" end="00:31:52.580" style="s2">Socrates but it&#39;s sometimes right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.860" end="00:31:55.370" style="s2">somehow Haley it&#39;s a Talos right yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.580" end="00:32:00.190" style="s2">right and that just that sense of just</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.370" end="00:32:03.770" style="s2">the calling like that the world right</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.190" end="00:32:06.290" style="s2">withdrawals right and the it withdrawals</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.770" end="00:32:09.590" style="s2">as the character becoming figure right</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.290" end="00:32:13.670" style="s2">the the world exists that just that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.590" end="00:32:16.130" style="s2">sense I think it shows the the non yet</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.670" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">like this is fine it keeps the keeps</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.130" end="00:32:21.260" style="s2">coming to me it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s on some</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:25.580" style="s2">level you could almost look at this</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.260" end="00:32:27.350" style="s2">dialog is Socrates completely holding up</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:29.810" style="s2">an image and taking it down holding up a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.350" end="00:32:32.510" style="s2">diminution taking it down like and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.810" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">and then all the way through and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.510" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">right the end he talks about virtue but</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:41.780" style="s2">the virtue is like where is the virtue</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">right yeah yeah cuz that because that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.780" end="00:32:45.000" style="s2">because the Telos of their relation is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:49.520" style="s2">the perceptual coming into</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.000" end="00:32:52.650" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s why it that&#39;s why it exceeds</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.520" end="00:32:54.090" style="s2">each of their identities yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.650" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why I mean when when now spidey</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.090" end="00:32:57.809" style="s2">says right I believe that we might</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:59.429" style="s2">switch roles somehow they can switch for</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.809" end="00:33:03.809" style="s2">the prospect of them switching roles</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.429" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t at all undermine the prospective</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.809" end="00:33:09.150" style="s2">friendship and its future possibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.380" end="00:33:11.400" style="s2">precisely because the mutual coming into</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.150" end="00:33:13.530" style="s2">virtue that characterizes the relation</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.400" end="00:33:17.400" style="s2">is over and above the identities that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.530" end="00:33:19.470" style="s2">are disposed in there and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.400" end="00:33:21.270" style="s2">there in there in the commitments of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.470" end="00:33:22.860" style="s2">everyday I shouldn&#39;t say commitments</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.270" end="00:33:25.530" style="s2">that&#39;s confusing things but in the in</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.860" end="00:33:27.450" style="s2">the sort of the roles of the everyday as</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.530" end="00:33:31.740" style="s2">they taken up with in Athenian society</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.450" end="00:33:33.450" style="s2">right it become kind of icons yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.740" end="00:33:35.970" style="s2">each other yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.450" end="00:33:39.179" style="s2">certainly Socrates Delphi IDs and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.970" end="00:33:41.760" style="s2">but but there but the reciprocity is</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.179" end="00:33:46.650" style="s2">loaned by Socrates to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.760" end="00:33:49.169" style="s2">right right yes right that&#39;s the gist I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.650" end="00:33:51.510" style="s2">was just surprised at how much of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.169" end="00:33:56.400" style="s2">is about is is really about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.510" end="00:33:58.980" style="s2">it&#39;s about setting up idols and taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.400" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">them away yeah yeah setting up idols and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.980" end="00:34:03.809" style="s2">taking them away right just that sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:06.539" style="s2">of what is the thing that we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.809" end="00:34:09.419" style="s2">real and that there that that&#39;s where it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.539" end="00:34:13.080" style="s2">starts to get at that sense of where the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:15.270" style="s2">pair even in this even in the even that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.080" end="00:34:20.099" style="s2">the medium is language and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.270" end="00:34:24.300" style="s2">right what basically I think in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.099" end="00:34:26.099" style="s2">it&#39;s there like the dialogue is leading</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.300" end="00:34:31.409" style="s2">them into something that can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.099" end="00:34:33.030" style="s2">be said right but in that role Binks I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.409" end="00:34:34.649" style="s2">have a feeling the roles will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.030" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">switched right and he&#39;s saying it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.649" end="00:34:41.010" style="s2">oh yeah its presence is the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:43.320" style="s2">like even the thing we&#39;re circling</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.010" end="00:34:44.790" style="s2">around that&#39;s emerging it&#39;s been calling</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.320" end="00:34:48.119" style="s2">through the conversation the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.790" end="00:34:51.500" style="s2">that like if you try to grab it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.119" end="00:34:55.619" style="s2">the thing but it it&#39;s the normativity</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.500" end="00:34:58.250" style="s2">right that&#39;s right that gret like it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.619" end="00:34:58.250" style="s2">granted by</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:05.450" style="s2">in a certain sense the future right</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.650" end="00:35:07.329" style="s2">which ends up being the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.450" end="00:35:09.380" style="s2">normativity right so like the origin</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.329" end="00:35:11.510" style="s2">thing about Heidegger now like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.380" end="00:35:15.020" style="s2">sense of like yeah origin always calls</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.510" end="00:35:20.390" style="s2">from the future hmm right because it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.020" end="00:35:23.660" style="s2">that sense of like in a virtue you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.390" end="00:35:25.099" style="s2">have the virtue yet you don&#39;t have it no</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.660" end="00:35:26.990" style="s2">way that&#39;s why you&#39;re you&#39;re coming into</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.099" end="00:35:28.940" style="s2">it you&#39;re ever coming into it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.990" end="00:35:31.130" style="s2">coming into it you&#39;re ever having into</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.940" end="00:35:33.319" style="s2">it totally it is something that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.130" end="00:35:36.200" style="s2">something you&#39;re it and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.319" end="00:35:38.569" style="s2">think the possessive that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.200" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">inversion of the possessive relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.569" end="00:35:42.890" style="s2">is very important right yeah um similar</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.890" style="s2">to the idea that you don&#39;t have ideas</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.890" end="00:35:48.650" style="s2">ideas have you right that feels kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.890" end="00:35:49.849" style="s2">adage from you and others the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.650" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">applies here I think that right that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.849" end="00:35:55.369" style="s2">you&#39;re not you&#39;re not possessed of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">virtue of the virtue you are you are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.369" end="00:36:01.490" style="s2">are possessed by the virtue you you</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:05.539" style="s2">yield yourself to its possession almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.490" end="00:36:07.700" style="s2">magnetically right and and that&#39;s why it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.539" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">ends I think that&#39;s part of why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.700" end="00:36:10.609" style="s2">right I mean they&#39;re groping there</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:14.839" style="s2">they&#39;re there they&#39;re circling around</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.609" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">the something that is withdrawing from</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.839" end="00:36:20.450" style="s2">them as they Center on it what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">that&#39;s why this ends that&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.450" end="00:36:28.579" style="s2">enigmatic aliy with a with a with a with</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:32.119" style="s2">a profession to continue groping with a</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.579" end="00:36:34.069" style="s2">profession to continual to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.119" end="00:36:37.069" style="s2">Center on that which cannot be centered</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.069" end="00:36:41.569" style="s2">on nice nice groping you it with you my</p>
