<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:09.780" style="s2">talking about the notion of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">relationship between universal basic</p>

<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">the meaning crisis and and then dot dot</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">dot so right and I think this is also</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:21.930" style="s2">germane to our discussions about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:23.939" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion because</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.939" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">that if the religion was try to make</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:29.760" style="s2">these the non-negotiables that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:33.320" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion has to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.760" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">address or we failed in the design yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.320" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">but I was talking to now by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">would never bridge I would actually say</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:44.820" style="s2">something like so if we take you VI as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">pointer to a category universal basic</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.820" end="00:00:52.320" style="s2">income that category the scenic when on</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">its design characteristics include the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.320" end="00:00:55.710" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religious yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">oh yes I like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.710" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">yes of a combo combination I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">that&#39;s good so and I think this fits in</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:05.220" style="s2">even better now that you&#39;ve made that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:06.930" style="s2">bridge and that you&#39;ve made it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.220" end="00:01:10.350" style="s2">reciprocal reconstruction and</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.930" end="00:01:12.840" style="s2">integration so soggy the ocean and he I</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.350" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">was trying to point out that because he</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:15.780" style="s2">was actually asking but okay how do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">take this stuff about the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.780" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">and how do we Ratchet it up to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:22.700" style="s2">structural social structural level right</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:25.369" style="s2">right of sort of our our socio cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.700" end="00:01:28.049" style="s2">political economic you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.369" end="00:01:29.460" style="s2">organizations and the first thing I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.049" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">was you know well I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">expertise at that so I want to be very</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">cautious but one of the things we talked</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">about was we talked about how our</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:40.860" style="s2">culture has tended to conflate the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">pursuit of subjective well-being with</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.860" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">the pursuit of meaning in life that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">those are actually not the same thing um</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">and they should be distinguished and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:53.990" style="s2">culture has also thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">pursued that the correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.990" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">resolving socio economic distress and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:02:00.360" style="s2">subjective well-being is a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">linear one in women and of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">not right the relationship like so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">socio-economic distress when you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">poverty in huge impact on subjective</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:10.319" style="s2">well-being but once you get out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">poverty as you as you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.319" end="00:02:13.720" style="s2">research the graph you know really</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:17.530" style="s2">starts to flatten</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.720" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">comes irrational to pursue these things</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.530" end="00:02:21.940" style="s2">because you have to put it you need a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:23.740" style="s2">huge increase in wealth for example of</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.940" end="00:02:25.780" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me that word to make very</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.740" end="00:02:27.430" style="s2">small differences if people&#39;s subjective</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:28.750" style="s2">well-being because you get into very</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.430" end="00:02:32.020" style="s2">quickly you get into powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.750" end="00:02:34.270" style="s2">diminishing returns so that so the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.020" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">relationship is not a linear correlation</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.270" end="00:02:38.890" style="s2">and then also subjective well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:41.260" style="s2">meaning in life are very different</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.890" end="00:02:42.580" style="s2">things right and the classic example I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.260" end="00:02:45.010" style="s2">use you might have heard me use this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.580" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">before is having a child when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.010" end="00:02:49.780" style="s2">child many of the measures that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">Enlightenment talked about go down like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.780" end="00:02:54.190" style="s2">your your finances get really hot yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:56.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not sleeping right you&#39;re getting</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.910" end="00:03:17.470" style="s2">because meaning in life goes up because</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.070" end="00:03:18.970" style="s2">why well what&#39;s happening is you if</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.470" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about people who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.970" end="00:03:23.410" style="s2">to become good parents right and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2">want to be parents I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.410" end="00:03:30.370" style="s2">parenting in this sense much beyond</p>

<p begin="00:03:30.370" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">well what happens is you I mean it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.440" end="00:03:36.130" style="s2">of the most profound things to take you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:39.400" style="s2">out of your ego centrism right because</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.130" end="00:03:41.980" style="s2">you you know you the child is now the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.400" end="00:03:43.690" style="s2">center and this is that this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.980" end="00:03:45.040" style="s2">the factors that so contributory of</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.690" end="00:03:47.650" style="s2">meaning in life is called mattering I</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.040" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">want to matter I want to be highly</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">mattering that transformation from</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:02.230" style="s2">egocentrism to other centrism or even</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:04.330" style="s2">Anto centrism is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.230" end="00:04:06.040" style="s2">is constitutive of you know in enhance</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.330" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">meaning let you be as Susan will said</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.040" end="00:04:09.450" style="s2">you&#39;re connected to something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.860" style="s2">than yourself something that has a value</p>

<p begin="00:04:11.860" end="00:04:15.430" style="s2">preferring it because we think persons</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.480" end="00:04:17.590" style="s2">have inherent value to them right and</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.590" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">making the person and so I think I look</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:24.099" style="s2">part of it he was asking me to respond</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:25.539" style="s2">to people like Steven Pinker and like</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.099" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">well you know look at my drafts look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.539" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">my crops</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.320" end="00:04:30.760" style="s2">and I was saying well again I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:33.220" style="s2">Enlightenment made a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.760" end="00:04:35.590" style="s2">confusions and that it got locked into</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.220" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">our socio-economic political grammar or</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.590" end="00:04:41.170" style="s2">code to use your language in that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:43.390" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve made a mistake we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.170" end="00:04:45.190" style="s2">conflated and confused meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.390" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">with subjective well-being that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.190" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">mistake and then we thought the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:50.620" style="s2">relationship between socio-economic</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:52.870" style="s2">improvement and subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.620" end="00:04:54.430" style="s2">was a linear one and it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.870" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">curvilinear right in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.430" end="00:04:59.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s why you can see you</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">know areas of huge affluence like</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.920" end="00:05:04.390" style="s2">Silicon Valley also being places places</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:06.550" style="s2">in which the meaning crisis is being</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.390" end="00:05:08.650" style="s2">experienced in a very intense manner and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.550" end="00:05:12.340" style="s2">now I think I think that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.650" end="00:05:15.730" style="s2">sort of bring in here and and I I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.340" end="00:05:19.570" style="s2">therefore that what you just did a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.730" end="00:05:22.870" style="s2">minute ago is completely apropos of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.570" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">that what&#39;s going on is yeah we just I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.870" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">think I like this matter where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:28.930" style="s2">just dumping money on people isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:32.740" style="s2">to be enough precisely because that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.930" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">dumping right it is still caught up with</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.740" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">in this grammar that that I say that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:40.420" style="s2">saying is deeply mistaken in these two</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">kind of profound ways and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.420" end="00:05:44.140" style="s2">right the the universal basic income and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.360" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion have</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.140" end="00:05:49.870" style="s2">to be powerfully integrated if we really</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.360" end="00:05:52.990" style="s2">want to try and have a good shot at</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.870" end="00:05:54.490" style="s2">improving people&#39;s lives yeah yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.990" end="00:05:56.320" style="s2">was that was a bit of a speech but I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.490" end="00:05:57.580" style="s2">thought there was an important argument</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.580" end="00:06:00.520" style="s2">yeah I think all the pieces fit together</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.290" style="s2">quite nicely and your writing was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.520" end="00:06:03.730" style="s2">size of the piece that was that all the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.290" end="00:06:05.350" style="s2">pieces had to be there to actually have</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.610" end="00:06:12.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection that loops back</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.860" end="00:06:18.640" style="s2">think there&#39;s a triangle or something</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.390" end="00:06:21.700" style="s2">yeah yeah and I was talking to Sean</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.640" end="00:06:23.890" style="s2">about that too and I mentioned our work</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.700" end="00:06:24.250" style="s2">your work and I to him a lot on this</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.250" end="00:06:32.230" style="s2">and I was saying well what what I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.170" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">talk about is you know the how that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.230" end="00:06:36.310" style="s2">those confusions we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:37.960" style="s2">about are bound up with a confusion that</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.310" end="00:06:40.090" style="s2">comes from sort of from the</p>

<p begin="00:06:44.169" end="00:06:49.180" style="s2">to you know Fromm&#39;s idea of the way</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.930" end="00:06:51.910" style="s2">capitalism tends to promote modal</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.180" end="00:06:53.740" style="s2">confusion in powerful ways because what</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.910" end="00:06:56.860" style="s2">you get right is you get a certain</p>

<p begin="00:07:11.800" end="00:07:15.160" style="s2">deeply dysfunctional in the sense that</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.240" end="00:07:43.660" style="s2">the meaning system beautiful yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.190" style="s2">the constructor actually works quite</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.130" end="00:08:23.050" style="s2">seems to be wrong broken it&#39;s because</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.050" end="00:08:26.950" style="s2">well there happens is is that you way of</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.450" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">meaningfulness is this modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.690" end="00:08:41.830" style="s2">precisely a modal yell fusion in writing</p>

<p begin="00:08:50.130" end="00:08:55.590" style="s2">simulate that at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.530" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">socio-economic right right right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.590" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">then what happens in since then we the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:00.180" style="s2">sprayer exist the other directions we</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:01.590" style="s2">actually bring from the minutes and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.180" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">trend incentive to the emission and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.590" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">down into the imminent which is that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:10.340" style="s2">now collapse the just so more and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">therefore if meaningfulness is is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.340" end="00:09:16.190" style="s2">commodity that we can produce this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:21.180" style="s2">you economic then subjective well-being</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.190" end="00:09:23.690" style="s2">must in fact be always best satisfied by</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.180" end="00:09:26.970" style="s2">an increase in the socio-economic domain</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.690" end="00:09:28.650" style="s2">and by the way we now actually occlude</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.970" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">we lose track of the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.650" end="00:09:31.140" style="s2">subjective well-being and meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:33.270" style="s2">are aren&#39;t the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.140" end="00:09:35.430" style="s2">we actually difficult with this weird</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.270" end="00:09:45.210" style="s2">construction if you what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.430" end="00:09:46.890" style="s2">about is reversing that flow right oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.210" end="00:09:51.180" style="s2">that was brilliant what you just did I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.890" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">thought that was really good that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.180" end="00:09:55.890" style="s2">to me like at sort of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:57.750" style="s2">level something deeply analogous to what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.890" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">Mark Lewis talks about on the individual</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:02.370" style="s2">well reciprocal narrowing and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:03.990" style="s2">getting a reciprocal narrowing it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.370" end="00:10:06.270" style="s2">to me like if you&#39;re going one way that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.990" end="00:10:08.940" style="s2">that whole triad that you just pointed</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.270" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">to can do risk reciprocal opening or it</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.940" end="00:10:12.000" style="s2">can do reciprocal narrowing and you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:15.390" style="s2">get in locked into something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.000" end="00:10:17.310" style="s2">analogous to addiction and ocean was</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.390" end="00:10:19.560" style="s2">talking about this about how people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.310" end="00:10:21.780" style="s2">cut there&#39;s no alternative to what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.560" end="00:10:22.950" style="s2">have there is no option of B we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.780" end="00:10:24.900" style="s2">the end of history because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.790" end="00:10:30.450" style="s2">can have you hear lots of arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.680" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">that effect and that&#39;s exactly the state</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.450" end="00:10:35.400" style="s2">that the addict is in I can&#39;t be other</p>

<p begin="00:10:40.470" end="00:10:43.650" style="s2">the Attic that&#39;s what the Audi is</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.120" end="00:10:46.110" style="s2">reciprocally narrowed down to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.650" end="00:10:47.940" style="s2">stuckness and frozenness and it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.110" end="00:10:49.770" style="s2">me you&#39;re describing something analogous</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.940" end="00:10:51.330" style="s2">to that but at the macro level rather</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.770" end="00:10:53.490" style="s2">than that at the individual level is</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.330" end="00:10:55.860" style="s2">that is that fair yeah very very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.490" end="00:10:57.300" style="s2">for Mom and you can actually show it way</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.860" end="00:10:59.910" style="s2">what I notice is you&#39;re saying it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.300" end="00:11:02.610" style="s2">okay if you flip it like this notion the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.910" end="00:11:04.110" style="s2">place of a proper place or imagination</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.610" end="00:11:05.940" style="s2">the proper place for</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.620" end="00:11:13.950" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in is that that transcended</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.750" end="00:11:16.290" style="s2">mode but the mode in which</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.950" end="00:11:17.670" style="s2">meaningfulness is anchored in the way</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.670" end="00:11:21.089" style="s2">so precisely if you&#39;re going in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.019" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">direction which in my visual that is the</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:27.019" style="s2">yeah anti-clockwise to use that think</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.050" end="00:11:28.740" style="s2">the more poetic British construction</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.019" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">yeah that would make sense you would</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.740" end="00:11:32.490" style="s2">actually have a reciprocal narrowing and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:34.320" style="s2">increasing in capacity to transcend and</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.670" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">altogether where it was actually bike</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.649" end="00:11:42.390" style="s2">going back and saying ah this is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">mode like geez if I feel stuck actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.390" end="00:11:46.470" style="s2">to figure how to settle back into and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.920" end="00:11:49.380" style="s2">release myself from that that cycle that</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.519" end="00:11:57.959" style="s2">there so this sounds to me like again</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.709" end="00:11:59.790" style="s2">another design feature for the religion</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.959" end="00:12:03.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion right in addition</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.790" end="00:12:06.120" style="s2">that in addition to that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.240" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">coupled to ameliorating right the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.120" end="00:12:12.450" style="s2">meta-crisis it should be one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">doing this macro reciprocal opening yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.450" end="00:12:17.370" style="s2">we should be able to articulate and say</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">no no this is did here&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.370" end="00:12:22.470" style="s2">narrative to because people are oriented</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:23.640" style="s2">toward here&#39;s a clear narrative of how</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.470" end="00:12:26.190" style="s2">we&#39;re cycling through this as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.640" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">reciprocal opening rather than cycling</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.190" end="00:12:31.110" style="s2">through this in reciprocal narrowing</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:32.790" style="s2">would you say that&#39;s also an important</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.110" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">design feature then yeah yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.790" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">to make that&#39;s that is it app for short</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.620" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">I can&#39;t say anchor nail it now how that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:48.420" style="s2">really shows up in reality I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:49.860" style="s2">a really interesting yeah feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.420" end="00:12:51.329" style="s2">like actually drop into that level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.860" end="00:12:53.310" style="s2">concretion like doing a concrete example</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.329" end="00:12:55.020" style="s2">of that I think it&#39;s good let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.310" end="00:12:56.190" style="s2">though let&#39;s do it yeah and I like the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.020" end="00:12:58.440" style="s2">idea it may be trying to explore it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.190" end="00:13:00.060" style="s2">using the metaphor of the Attic yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.440" end="00:13:01.410" style="s2">because we&#39;ve seen this like the 12-step</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.060" end="00:13:03.449" style="s2">program did that that&#39;s what it does</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.410" end="00:13:06.329" style="s2">they&#39;ve got the 12-step program toaster</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.449" end="00:13:09.959" style="s2">program is a program that slows down the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.329" end="00:13:12.270" style="s2">cycle right and actually enforces you it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.959" end="00:13:13.680" style="s2">requires that you open back up to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.270" end="00:13:15.029" style="s2">transcendent as when you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.680" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">bottom of the cycle you have to open</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.029" end="00:13:18.640" style="s2">back up to transcendence and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve connected something that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.640" end="00:13:22.420" style="s2">greater to yourself and you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:25.210" style="s2">surrendered like I can&#39;t solve this</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.420" end="00:13:26.590" style="s2">problem so I surrender completely which</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.210" end="00:13:28.840" style="s2">is in some sense like you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.590" end="00:13:30.190" style="s2">cycle that sort of wound like this and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.840" end="00:13:33.130" style="s2">you&#39;re slowing it down slowing it down</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.190" end="00:13:34.960" style="s2">slowing it down theory you has this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.130" end="00:13:36.220" style="s2">notion at the bottom to you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.960" end="00:13:37.630" style="s2">little bit like that like it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.220" end="00:13:40.150" style="s2">getting back down to the bottom that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.630" end="00:13:43.060" style="s2">would do is sort of a hard reboot and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.150" end="00:13:45.010" style="s2">then you begin again from the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.060" end="00:13:47.260" style="s2">the U but now not but now cycling in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">right direction and right trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.260" end="00:13:50.440" style="s2">a way to stay in that right genetic</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.440" end="00:13:56.980" style="s2">from that place so I&#39;m leaking the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.960" end="00:14:00.010" style="s2">notion that you just mentioned of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.980" end="00:14:02.680" style="s2">surrender to an ocean of faith that</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.010" end="00:14:05.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t see faith in terms of belief but</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.680" end="00:14:09.580" style="s2">like the auth that you&#39;ve got a sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.640" end="00:14:12.790" style="s2">that you are like immersed in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.580" end="00:14:14.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a course that&#39;s unfolding as</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.790" end="00:14:17.410" style="s2">things are opening up right because we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.680" end="00:14:18.970" style="s2">know I mean nobody&#39;s no no nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.410" end="00:14:20.530" style="s2">sorry worries about the epistemic status</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.970" end="00:14:23.110" style="s2">of knowing when there&#39;s falling downward</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.530" end="00:14:25.000" style="s2">and getting stuff so that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.110" end="00:14:26.590" style="s2">brought this up with market if we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.000" end="00:14:28.450" style="s2">that sense we also have the other sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.590" end="00:14:30.400" style="s2">we have the Platonic and a gothic sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.450" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">at least late nerves we know what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.400" end="00:14:36.580" style="s2">like to become unstuck and to be opening</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:39.310" style="s2">up right and right my god my faith is</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.580" end="00:14:43.300" style="s2">that sense you know reliably not</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.310" end="00:14:45.160" style="s2">perfectly good yes yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.300" end="00:14:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s great like you can even have yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.160" end="00:14:48.370" style="s2">faith faith is very well grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.960" end="00:14:51.610" style="s2">that sense that sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.370" end="00:14:53.140" style="s2">am i spiraling down or am i at least in</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.610" end="00:14:55.960" style="s2">the process of beginning to spiral pop</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.140" end="00:14:58.570" style="s2">yes exactly exactly and that that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.960" end="00:15:01.950" style="s2">that really picks up again on the older</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:04.140" style="s2">and I think better meaning of Metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.950" end="00:15:06.760" style="s2">which is the term that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.140" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">translated as conversion like you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.760" end="00:15:10.450" style="s2">converting into a religion but Metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.480" style="s2">actually meant you know a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.450" end="00:15:15.580" style="s2">change neue to notice noesis like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.480" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">your salience landscape in Metta it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.940" end="00:15:29.050" style="s2">picking up on rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.290" end="00:15:30.970" style="s2">acquisition of conviction of particular</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.970" end="00:15:37.780" style="s2">absolutely yeah yeah again that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.200" end="00:15:40.450" style="s2">that&#39;s that done Moodle reversal yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.780" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">exactly because I call faith conviction</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.450" end="00:15:44.170" style="s2">and certain proposition beliefs you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:46.030" style="s2">going the wrong direction dude I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.170" end="00:15:49.210" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.030" end="00:15:51.640" style="s2">right and you could see why if you if</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.210" end="00:15:53.140" style="s2">you&#39;re if you have the off right this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.640" end="00:15:55.660" style="s2">why you have the taste metaphors in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.140" end="00:15:58.450" style="s2">Bible or in other another sacred</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.660" end="00:16:00.070" style="s2">literature because if when I&#39;m spiraling</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.450" end="00:16:02.020" style="s2">downward I&#39;m getting the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.070" end="00:16:03.700" style="s2">narrowing in the modal confusion and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.020" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">hungry in a way that I can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.700" end="00:16:08.380" style="s2">articulate but when I when I&#39;m spiraling</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:10.210" style="s2">up I&#39;m starting to be less hungry and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.380" end="00:16:12.600" style="s2">less frustrated and I&#39;m starting to also</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.210" end="00:16:16.630" style="s2">be able to articulate why I&#39;m no longer</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.600" end="00:16:19.450" style="s2">hungry and how I and precisely how and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.630" end="00:16:20.890" style="s2">why I was hungry before and you get but</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.450" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">you can only do that while you&#39;re in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.190" end="00:16:28.210" style="s2">transformation that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.050" end="00:16:31.120" style="s2">important part yeah I mean the lyrics to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.210" end="00:16:33.310" style="s2">Amazing Grace yes yes lost but now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.120" end="00:16:35.320" style="s2">found and yes my cup overfloweth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.310" end="00:16:36.940" style="s2">that characteristic of the yes eating it</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.650" end="00:16:48.430" style="s2">obligate propositional epistemology but</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.300" end="00:16:51.930" style="s2">you&#39;re having propositions rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.430" end="00:16:54.880" style="s2">being faithful right yes that&#39;s right ya</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.930" end="00:16:56.200" style="s2">know what I like about this is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.880" end="00:16:58.300" style="s2">something about if you can get down to</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.200" end="00:17:01.150" style="s2">the right characteristics it gets very</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.300" end="00:17:02.860" style="s2">simple I think I know that easy but</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.150" end="00:17:04.770" style="s2">simple no no I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.860" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">distinction and I think it&#39;s important I</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.770" end="00:17:09.880" style="s2">this goes towards the scalability issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.829" style="s2">you know Paul basically talks about its</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.880" end="00:17:13.660" style="s2">got it it&#39;s got to appeal to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.829" end="00:17:15.880" style="s2">homeless person and to the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.660" end="00:17:19.180" style="s2">mmm-hmm if there&#39;s a sense in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.880" end="00:17:21.220" style="s2">very simple in one it again not easy but</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.180" end="00:17:23.140" style="s2">it&#39;s simple in the sense that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.220" end="00:17:25.720" style="s2">enacted in embodied by human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.140" end="00:17:27.610" style="s2">right at the depths of them bottoming</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.720" end="00:17:29.590" style="s2">out as you just said but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.610" end="00:17:31.900" style="s2">presumably what he means by the homeless</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.590" end="00:17:34.150" style="s2">person but it can also reach off into</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.900" end="00:17:36.130" style="s2">the upper echelon of the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.150" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">trying to come up with a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.130" end="00:17:40.720" style="s2">culturally transformative way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:42.580" style="s2">and thinking at a highly abstract level</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.720" end="00:17:44.290" style="s2">what I think what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.580" end="00:17:46.030" style="s2">here is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.290" end="00:17:47.260" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the test that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.030" end="00:17:59.610" style="s2">another test the test for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.260" end="00:18:04.170" style="s2">scalability hmm okay yeah Yale ability</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.610" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">something like process or dynamics uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.170" end="00:18:08.110" style="s2">okay there we go great</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:11.470" style="s2">I love it would you do that by the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.110" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">oh really no no I mean I really enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.470" end="00:18:15.880" style="s2">just as an experience to belong to and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">be part of so like thank you for that I</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.880" end="00:18:25.930" style="s2">really like it a lot so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:28.600" style="s2">thing scalability where we have there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.930" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">kind of like I&#39;ve got so many different</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.600" end="00:18:31.930" style="s2">metaphors but if there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:36.330" style="s2">a way of thinking about scalability that</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.930" end="00:18:36.330" style="s2">is coming from a place that is like like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.100" end="00:18:43.000" style="s2">copy you can copy it a lot you can copy</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.660" end="00:18:44.710" style="s2">it a lot with with decreasing loss like</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.000" end="00:18:48.700" style="s2">amuses prayer if I get the other part in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.710" end="00:18:50.260" style="s2">Atlanta and better and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.700" end="00:18:52.150" style="s2">something where this the scalability is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.260" end="00:18:55.810" style="s2">actually generative where it actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.150" end="00:18:58.900" style="s2">the more people who are participating in</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.810" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">it the more capacity that it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.900" end="00:19:02.800" style="s2">for everyone who&#39;s participating so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">my distinct she was rivalries in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.800" end="00:19:09.340" style="s2">answer rival is everything that the</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.340" end="00:19:13.960" style="s2">the left-hand term scarcity like</p>

<p begin="00:19:15.730" end="00:19:24.310" style="s2">plenitude I&#39;m just gonna so yeah if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.660" end="00:19:26.740" style="s2">use like like food rice on the left hand</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.870" end="00:21:07.460" style="s2">where and this is like network effect</p>

<p begin="00:21:19.270" end="00:21:23.300" style="s2">if I&#39;m thinking about the ante rival is</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.300" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">calling for that middle zone say hey it</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.250" end="00:21:28.370" style="s2">needs to be shareable here&#39;s we really</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:30.470" style="s2">well shared anything we can share to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.370" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">homeless guy I started going keep going</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.470" end="00:21:35.000" style="s2">say no no no we&#39;d actually fit peg it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:36.800" style="s2">all the way to the right where to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.000" end="00:21:38.990" style="s2">shared it at all with anyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.800" end="00:21:40.280" style="s2">intrinsically increases the capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:21:40.280" end="00:21:45.620" style="s2">ah so it recursively it sort of evolves</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.070" end="00:21:46.820" style="s2">its its capacity for sharing he thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.620" end="00:21:49.070" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t just it doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.820" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">replicate it evolves in that sense right</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.070" end="00:21:54.520" style="s2">right right right that&#39;s the that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:57.500" style="s2">key right that&#39;s the inside that no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.520" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">that it&#39;s not scalable in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.500" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">you can share it broadly it&#39;s scalable</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:03.190" style="s2">in the sense that once it gets past a</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.190" end="00:22:08.120" style="s2">inevitable because there&#39;s capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.290" end="00:22:10.100" style="s2">bring more people in is so high and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.120" end="00:22:11.900" style="s2">every person that brings in increases</p>

<p begin="00:22:17.419" end="00:22:22.340" style="s2">in the fashion it&#39;s sort of like open to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.390" end="00:22:25.070" style="s2">article F right that&#39;s what I was going</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.340" end="00:22:28.580" style="s2">to lead to exactly exactly exactly</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.659" end="00:22:38.210" style="s2">another major point to bring in here</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.279" end="00:22:41.419" style="s2">that what we need right is an ecology of</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.419" end="00:22:46.850" style="s2">sense of scalability there should be a</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.850" end="00:24:27.450" style="s2">must be part of it but if you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.380" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">that then it&#39;s dude immediately it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.450" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">die for sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.200" end="00:24:32.490" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just a matter of time and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:33.539" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem like everything we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.490" end="00:24:35.220" style="s2">done in the context that I&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.539" end="00:24:37.830" style="s2">game a how does that characteristic is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.220" end="00:24:39.000" style="s2">that it it any it&#39;s funny I look really</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.830" end="00:24:41.070" style="s2">like this when you&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.000" end="00:24:43.770" style="s2">the cycle this dynamic cycle where we</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.070" end="00:24:47.010" style="s2">have the axial age director look at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.770" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">Bronze Age collapse goes crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.010" end="00:24:49.980" style="s2">everybody&#39;s kind of forced to go back to</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">well we got to figure out some new</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.980" end="00:24:53.429" style="s2">just really not working and let me</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:57.559" style="s2">figure out some new and then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.429" end="00:24:57.559" style="s2">build with it like crazy for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.010" end="00:25:06.179" style="s2"> that&#39;s just kind of building this</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.059" end="00:25:08.429" style="s2">this build area and we and we invert the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.179" end="00:25:13.590" style="s2">cycle we start losing track oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.429" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">good relationship it&#39;s funny seems like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.590" end="00:25:17.130" style="s2">it actually happens I think about this I</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.750" style="s2">become say having a background in mind</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.130" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">was phrased like there&#39;s a reason why</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.750" end="00:25:21.270" style="s2">Buddha Socrates and Jesus didn&#39;t write</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:24.240" style="s2"> down</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.270" end="00:25:25.830" style="s2">yeah this is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.240" end="00:25:29.130" style="s2">characteristic I remember watching this</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.830" end="00:25:30.450" style="s2">documentary of Buddhism and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.130" end="00:25:32.789" style="s2">Cameron is just kind of right on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.450" end="00:25:34.890" style="s2">tree there the Buddha&#39;s there Bodhi tree</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.789" end="00:25:36.929" style="s2">right and it&#39;s perfect cuz you see the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.890" end="00:25:39.090" style="s2">tree he&#39;s against women my mind&#39;s eye is</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.929" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">like oh the trees in a forest</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.090" end="00:25:43.260" style="s2">alright and then it started zooming out</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:44.820" style="s2">and it gets to a certain point you begin</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.260" end="00:25:47.130" style="s2">you see this with riot of color and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.820" end="00:25:48.270" style="s2">cacophony of like stalls and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:51.929" style="s2">basically it&#39;s Disney World</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.270" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2">Buddhist new world on the Mall of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.929" end="00:25:55.620" style="s2">America we were crazy in a very oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.700" end="00:25:58.169" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens right what happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.620" end="00:25:59.370" style="s2">is there&#39;s a moment of generativity</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.169" end="00:26:00.630" style="s2">where the modes are in the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.370" end="00:26:03.870" style="s2">orientation going in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.630" end="00:26:06.150" style="s2">but for some reason it&#39;s so and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.870" end="00:26:08.490" style="s2">super salient if the movements of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.150" end="00:26:11.159" style="s2">superfluous aliens is such an easy</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.490" end="00:26:12.659" style="s2">transition that we get this flip and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.159" end="00:26:15.330" style="s2">what the flip does is the flip just kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.659" end="00:26:16.830" style="s2">of it converts to propositional if</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.330" end="00:26:20.490" style="s2">inverse right right right right</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.830" end="00:26:23.659" style="s2">I&#39;m I scale in the in the middle term</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.490" end="00:26:26.010" style="s2">not scale on the right hand term yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.659" end="00:26:29.490" style="s2">there&#39;s probably activation energy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.010" end="00:26:30.840" style="s2">I thought about this as well that I get</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.490" end="00:26:32.820" style="s2">the feeling that we probably couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.840" end="00:26:34.919" style="s2">have pulled this off until sometime in</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.820" end="00:26:37.710" style="s2">the late seventies but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.919" end="00:26:39.929" style="s2">about just the underlying socio</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.710" end="00:26:42.690" style="s2">Nicolle capacity and the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.929" end="00:26:44.970" style="s2">rights literal like well-being and level</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.690" end="00:26:46.770" style="s2">of education or literacy and the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.970" end="00:26:48.600" style="s2">that audio ideological development that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.770" end="00:26:49.830" style="s2">and what the wideness like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.600" end="00:26:51.779" style="s2">globalization of it the general</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:55.080" style="s2">spreading out that had to already be in</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.779" end="00:26:57.029" style="s2">place the pushing that was too hard for</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.080" end="00:26:59.220" style="s2">these autocatalytic autopoietic systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.029" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">yeah so they eventually kind of ran at a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.220" end="00:27:02.399" style="s2">steam the default mechanism was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:04.230" style="s2">practical well it just goes super</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.399" end="00:27:07.289" style="s2">salient lock it in there top-down</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.230" end="00:27:09.510" style="s2">hierarchy is able to get done and a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.289" end="00:27:11.190" style="s2">do stuff which did I in churches</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.510" end="00:27:13.620" style="s2">developed in the old sort of religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.190" end="00:27:16.529" style="s2">that is a religion modality yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.620" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">and and things moved but the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.529" end="00:27:24.890" style="s2">proposition the hypothesis the hope is</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:27.090" style="s2">that the context is now super saturated</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.890" end="00:27:29.549" style="s2">fluid is super saturated and so the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.090" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">possibility of one of something that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.549" end="00:27:33.299" style="s2">coming in the right modality actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:34.649" style="s2">generating getting through the face</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.299" end="00:27:37.970" style="s2">transition and leaping over the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.649" end="00:27:39.870" style="s2">transition to being truly out of poetic</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.970" end="00:27:45.149" style="s2">he&#39;s available like it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.870" end="00:27:47.279" style="s2">possibility right oh my generation no no</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.149" end="00:27:48.690" style="s2">my generation talked about I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.279" end="00:27:51.059" style="s2">these people still use this somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.690" end="00:27:55.169" style="s2">know from physics the critical mass idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.059" end="00:27:56.789" style="s2">that you you like it sounded like only</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.169" end="00:27:58.890" style="s2">only in the 70s do we have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.789" end="00:28:00.870" style="s2">enough that it could start becoming you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.890" end="00:28:02.490" style="s2">know autocatalytic and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.870" end="00:28:05.370" style="s2">self-organizing in a powerful way</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.490" end="00:28:07.230" style="s2">yeah and probably as I say it probably</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.370" end="00:28:09.950" style="s2">like in the 70s it began to have enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.230" end="00:28:13.230" style="s2">like we were beginning to get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.950" end="00:28:15.450" style="s2">components like you know that homeless</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.230" end="00:28:17.370" style="s2">guy so this is why the way I&#39;d the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.450" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">idea came up for me is that on the one</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.370" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">hand yes there needs to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.679" style="s2">field effect there&#39;s some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:24.390" style="s2">characteristic of the way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.679" end="00:28:25.649" style="s2">relationship with religion it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.390" end="00:28:26.970" style="s2">religion that actually looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.649" end="00:28:29.789" style="s2">individual level it was a way for them</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.970" end="00:28:31.679" style="s2">to sense in their body a up gradient</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.789" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">movement away from downward spiral and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.679" end="00:28:34.980" style="s2">towards upward spiral</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.610" end="00:28:36.510" style="s2">yeah the notion of faith to be felt yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.980" end="00:28:38.549" style="s2">exactly exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.510" end="00:28:41.370" style="s2">there&#39;s the conversion for them and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.549" end="00:28:43.200" style="s2">exactly and also though think about what</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.370" end="00:28:44.909" style="s2">happens when they&#39;re beginning to notice</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.200" end="00:28:46.950" style="s2">this in the context of some community</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.909" end="00:28:51.120" style="s2">you can actually noticing the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.950" end="00:28:57.290" style="s2">other people and the homeless person is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.120" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">which eligible but zoom back to 800 AD</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.290" end="00:29:03.240" style="s2">800 ad village and actually I&#39;m not even</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.100" style="s2">a village in like remote hinterlands at</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.240" end="00:29:06.600" style="s2">the northwest China it&#39;s an in Tuscany</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.100" end="00:29:08.940" style="s2">so I&#39;m clear like in a place that has</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.600" end="00:29:10.200" style="s2">some people at the end of the day the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.940" end="00:29:11.550" style="s2">likelihood that I&#39;m going to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.200" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">another person who&#39;s really heard the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.550" end="00:29:15.390" style="s2">word and is feeling this thing richly</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:17.130" style="s2">and deeply is actually kind of low yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.390" end="00:29:18.780" style="s2">not that many people around who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.130" end="00:29:21.480" style="s2">you know travel is very limited</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.780" end="00:29:24.090" style="s2">communication with people I&#39;m not lucky</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.480" end="00:29:25.410" style="s2">enough I might get up and kind of head</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.090" end="00:29:26.910" style="s2">to Assisi because I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.410" end="00:29:30.090" style="s2">some going down yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.910" end="00:29:31.980" style="s2">hundred years later but that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.090" end="00:29:35.670" style="s2">it right there&#39;s like here critical mass</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.980" end="00:29:37.980" style="s2">that the neutron density is preventing</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.670" end="00:29:40.559" style="s2">the fission from actually popping over</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.980" end="00:29:42.300" style="s2">the top but now it&#39;s there right now I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">could just kind of pop in to a location</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.300" end="00:29:46.830" style="s2">if the possibility of actually having</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:48.090" style="s2">not so many caddying rods like sucking</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.830" end="00:29:50.190" style="s2">the energy out of the system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.090" end="00:29:52.350" style="s2">wonderful all the time but they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.190" end="00:29:55.170" style="s2">having enough sort of you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.350" end="00:29:56.670" style="s2">feeling for what this this faith feels</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.170" end="00:29:58.650" style="s2">like right you can actually come in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.670" end="00:30:00.530" style="s2">other direction and you&#39;re beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.650" end="00:30:04.620" style="s2">notice with other people who have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.530" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">feel like and speak like then you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.620" end="00:30:07.559" style="s2">find them like we can have this you and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:09.000" style="s2">I can have this conversation and we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.559" end="00:30:10.500" style="s2">share this conversation and for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.000" end="00:30:11.820" style="s2">people this is either gonna be confusing</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.500" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">or annoying or whatever it happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.820" end="00:30:16.140" style="s2">but for some people it will land in a</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.140" end="00:30:19.650" style="s2">you know that generativity will increase</p>

<p begin="00:31:04.590" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">to innovate and instead they let&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:11.639" style="s2">building more on the basis of well</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.030" end="00:35:07.860" style="s2">wait sit down number one forever</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.490" end="00:35:09.710" style="s2">it still dies and that&#39;s like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.860" end="00:35:12.060" style="s2">place we could take a really good</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.710" end="00:35:13.410" style="s2">examination of that kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.060" end="00:35:17.700" style="s2">then of course we see this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.410" end="00:35:19.470" style="s2">also happened in like art communes mmm</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.700" end="00:35:20.550" style="s2">places where artists get together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.470" end="00:35:22.410" style="s2">that goes a different direction that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.550" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">goes in this direction of almost like</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.410" end="00:35:26.250" style="s2">evaporation like a fire that runs out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:27.480" style="s2">fuel right right right</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.480" end="00:35:31.619" style="s2">let&#39;s do this then this is good there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.490" end="00:35:34.829" style="s2">a tax aamani there so the first taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.619" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">is the you know the innovation dilemma I</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.829" end="00:35:38.970" style="s2">think that&#39;s important the the second</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:41.640" style="s2">one is that doing BR the artistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.970" end="00:35:44.040" style="s2">evaporation right it runs out of fuel</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.640" end="00:35:44.550" style="s2">right there there&#39;s something going</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.040" end="00:35:46.589" style="s2">wrong there</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.550" end="00:35:48.089" style="s2">then there&#39;s is there&#39;s potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.589" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">third one because people talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.089" end="00:35:53.460" style="s2">in general system collapse right the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:54.510" style="s2">idea that the system is complexify and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.460" end="00:35:55.859" style="s2">then what happened</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.510" end="00:35:57.690" style="s2">it complexify is to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.859" end="00:35:59.490" style="s2">complexities of the environment and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.690" end="00:36:02.369" style="s2">the system itself becomes so complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.490" end="00:36:04.349" style="s2">that it becomes as problematic as</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.369" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">anything it&#39;s trying to address in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.349" end="00:36:07.890" style="s2">environment and then it event it</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:09.810" style="s2">eventually it can&#39;t solve any problems</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.890" end="00:36:11.730" style="s2">because it&#39;s got so consumed with itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.810" end="00:36:12.869" style="s2">you see that&#39;s at the end of the at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.730" end="00:36:16.890" style="s2">Western Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.869" end="00:36:19.530" style="s2">like no matter what we do is just making</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.890" end="00:36:21.480" style="s2">things worse and the Empire becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.530" end="00:36:23.400" style="s2">problem as opposed to being the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.480" end="00:36:25.650" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to use to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.400" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">whole bunch of problems right and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.650" end="00:36:31.500" style="s2">that strikes me as another way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:33.569" style="s2">like so the system could be complexify</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.500" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">but they could come to a point where you</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.569" end="00:36:36.920" style="s2">you might be hitting something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:42.810" style="s2">general system collapse</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.920" end="00:36:45.089" style="s2">oh okay oh yes the collapse of complex</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.810" end="00:36:46.829" style="s2">societies right right it&#39;s precise I</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.089" end="00:36:48.540" style="s2">have this book but haven&#39;t read it but</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.829" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">we talked about a couple times yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.540" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s the that&#39;s the at least</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:54.900" style="s2">I would I would point that insight to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:36:55.589" style="s2">him I think there&#39;s other domains like</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.900" end="00:36:57.480" style="s2">different people from different</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.589" end="00:36:58.530" style="s2">exploring different domains have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.480" end="00:36:59.099" style="s2">the same thing happens in lots of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.530" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">different places</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.099" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">yeah he does it he does a very big job</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">describing exactly that so so part part</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.440" style="s2">part of what&#39;s sounding like I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:12.329" style="s2">say oh go ahead me someone when I kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.440" end="00:37:14.339" style="s2">of just so what happens on that curve</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.329" end="00:37:16.200" style="s2">right and I&#39;m not sure if canter writes</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.339" end="00:37:17.970" style="s2">about this I&#39;ve been kind of up in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.200" end="00:37:19.319" style="s2">eyeballs in this stuff for such a long</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.970" end="00:37:22.619" style="s2">time that I have a hard time not</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.319" end="00:37:24.540" style="s2">distinguishing exactly who so if I&#39;m on</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.619" end="00:37:27.030" style="s2">the Tainter curve right so the system is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.540" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">becoming more complex right and if</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.030" end="00:37:33.300" style="s2">there&#39;s like a couple of inflection</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.960" end="00:37:34.109" style="s2">points and it has to do with a funny you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.300" end="00:37:35.130" style="s2">can you actually take look at the shade</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.109" end="00:37:37.620" style="s2">of that shape of the curve so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.130" end="00:37:41.130" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.620" end="00:37:42.750" style="s2">maybe jerk acceleration and velocity so</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.130" end="00:37:43.500" style="s2">there&#39;s the jerk right so the jerk is</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.750" end="00:37:45.240" style="s2">the rate of change of acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.500" end="00:37:46.950" style="s2">acceleration is rate of change of</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.240" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">velocity and velocity of change of</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.950" end="00:37:54.090" style="s2">position so if I&#39;m looking at the curve</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:59.910" style="s2">the first inflection point happens when</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.090" end="00:38:01.590" style="s2">I actually go into zero jerk and less so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.910" end="00:38:04.710" style="s2">what happens is is that for a period of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.590" end="00:38:07.020" style="s2">time means the innovative capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.710" end="00:38:09.600" style="s2">the of the thing that is being developed</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.020" end="00:38:11.690" style="s2">actually is accelerating the rate the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.600" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">acceleration is accelerating and is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.690" end="00:38:18.750" style="s2">curve that looks acceleration itself and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:21.450" style="s2">as the point at which that stops</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.750" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">happening right and if I look at this if</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.450" end="00:38:24.990" style="s2">I can zoom at and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:26.280" style="s2">mathematical domain you actually start</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.990" end="00:38:28.770" style="s2">to begin seeing that this this is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.280" end="00:38:32.610" style="s2">point at which the accelerating returns</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.770" end="00:38:34.800" style="s2">begins to turn into not diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.610" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">returns but not as rapidly accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.800" end="00:38:38.340" style="s2">returns I didn&#39;t see the space is</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:40.280" style="s2">beginning to be filled is that what</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.340" end="00:38:42.420" style="s2">people shift to optimization to then</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.280" end="00:38:45.060" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.420" end="00:38:48.210" style="s2">generally speaking have a choice as far</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.060" end="00:38:52.860" style="s2">as I know everybody always fails which</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.210" end="00:38:55.710" style="s2">is you can choose at that point to step</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.860" end="00:38:57.330" style="s2">away from optimization or you can choose</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.710" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">to step towards optimization because</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.330" end="00:39:00.210" style="s2">what happens is is that you&#39;re at that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">point you&#39;re beginning to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.210" end="00:39:05.430" style="s2">low-hanging fruit have been picked right</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.620" style="s2">all right so it&#39;s not as easy to get the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.430" end="00:39:08.850" style="s2">easy stuff now here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.620" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">the problem this is the medicine that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.850" end="00:39:12.530" style="s2">that is so very difficult to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.890" end="00:39:17.040" style="s2">you can double down you can get better</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.630" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">at the thing let&#39;s do this go to oil</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.040" end="00:39:21.780" style="s2">like oil yep I remember you talking to</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">me about this yeah you know I I it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.780" end="00:39:26.190" style="s2">first iteration some very simple basic</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:28.200" style="s2">technology and not too many geographic</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.190" end="00:39:30.750" style="s2">regions and I&#39;m getting like just your</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.200" end="00:39:32.250" style="s2">cursors like little I can take it out of</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.750" end="00:39:34.650" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.250" end="00:39:38.520" style="s2">yeah and then something happens to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.650" end="00:39:42.450" style="s2">low-hanging would have been picked well</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.520" end="00:39:43.890" style="s2">either I can say I need to keep my</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.450" end="00:39:46.710" style="s2">fluidity open and not become too</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.890" end="00:39:48.810" style="s2">addicted to this particular oil on plug</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.710" end="00:39:50.850" style="s2">system to oil and the petroleum refining</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.810" end="00:39:52.440" style="s2">and construction all that whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.850" end="00:39:54.090" style="s2">or you can say how could I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.440" end="00:39:57.840" style="s2">pretty good innovation I&#39;m and double</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.090" end="00:40:00.060" style="s2">down on optimizing my oil construction</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.840" end="00:40:01.890" style="s2">like a little rig like I&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.060" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">figure how to drill deeper or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.890" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">happens to be oh oh so you get much more</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:08.060" style="s2">local in where you&#39;re innovating rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:13.110" style="s2">than global innovation you&#39;re living -</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.060" end="00:40:17.550" style="s2">right right you bind innovation into a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.110" end="00:40:22.080" style="s2">domain right that works right really</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.550" end="00:40:23.700" style="s2">well right now you&#39;re know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.080" end="00:40:26.100" style="s2">looking for it&#39;s gone from mystery to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.700" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">puzzle that&#39;s yeah familial - fine -</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.100" end="00:40:29.640" style="s2">well-defined problem yeah yeah yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.260" end="00:40:33.540" style="s2">I&#39;m now I get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:35.310" style="s2">Oh boom like now I have a boom gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.540" end="00:40:37.290" style="s2">really really good for a while I have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.310" end="00:40:39.330" style="s2">golden age and that&#39;s the really weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.290" end="00:40:41.400" style="s2">trick because you feel like Welsh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.330" end="00:40:44.730" style="s2">really good so obviously I must be must</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.400" end="00:40:46.260" style="s2">be winning you&#39;re exactly the same time</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.730" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">it&#39;s because you&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.260" end="00:40:50.060" style="s2">wrong thing salient right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:52.950" style="s2">you&#39;re making the wrong thing isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.060" end="00:40:54.930" style="s2">you&#39;re bullshitting yourself and it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.950" end="00:40:57.150" style="s2">hard so then the next thing of course is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.930" end="00:41:00.560" style="s2">then when you start going into zero</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.150" end="00:41:03.320" style="s2">acceleration right where my my</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.560" end="00:41:06.260" style="s2">accelerating returns has now shifted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.320" end="00:41:08.820" style="s2">diminishing returns so the velocity</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.260" end="00:41:11.070" style="s2">continues but now the cost per unit</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.820" end="00:41:13.350" style="s2">velocity is going up which by the way is</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.070" end="00:41:16.010" style="s2">happening all over the place yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.350" end="00:41:18.540" style="s2">now in the context of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.010" end="00:41:20.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a real trouble now I&#39;m a noun</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.540" end="00:41:22.290" style="s2">that now I&#39;m actually an adit now I kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.370" end="00:41:24.450" style="s2">of can feel it not can sense it like</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.290" end="00:41:26.850" style="s2">this is the seventies yeah all right the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.450" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">shocks get all over the place and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.850" end="00:41:31.560" style="s2">response at that point is really really</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:33.690" style="s2">better kick dude you this is a beggar</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.560" end="00:41:35.220" style="s2">you&#39;ve just got your first real moment</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.690" end="00:41:38.130" style="s2">of clarity now is the time to get off</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.220" end="00:41:38.310" style="s2">the juice but what do people do all</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.130" end="00:41:40.980" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.310" end="00:41:42.840" style="s2">it&#39;s hard like that now you know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.980" end="00:41:45.030" style="s2">build an entire addiction I think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.840" end="00:41:46.740" style="s2">back to oil up that bill harsh man</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.030" end="00:41:48.270" style="s2">absolutely get around if I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.740" end="00:41:50.070" style="s2">cars of that built the interstate</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.270" end="00:41:51.990" style="s2">highway system soon it&#39;s only 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.070" end="00:41:54.060" style="s2">old it still is functional</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.990" end="00:41:55.890" style="s2">yeah built in suburbs of that if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.060" end="00:41:58.080" style="s2">have cars suburbs will work like I live</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.890" end="00:42:00.810" style="s2">this massive infrastructure commitment</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.080" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">to a lifestyle premise on this</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.810" end="00:42:04.230" style="s2">particular capacity this complex or</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:05.880" style="s2">complicated structure so</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.230" end="00:42:07.980" style="s2">in some sense I have to blind I have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.880" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">do actually to commit to I</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.980" end="00:42:13.980" style="s2">think I&#39;m actually delusional</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:17.730" style="s2">so the eighties in America is there a</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.980" end="00:42:19.080" style="s2">way at which sorry to interrupt but I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.730" end="00:42:22.230" style="s2">just want to explore this lot with you</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.080" end="00:42:25.980" style="s2">quickly like is there a way in which our</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.230" end="00:42:28.200" style="s2">culture is in that sense and I sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.980" end="00:42:29.550" style="s2">do this very cautiously and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.200" end="00:42:31.830" style="s2">to be dismissive or insulting</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.550" end="00:42:33.300" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s really I&#39;m now Singh that</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.830" end="00:42:35.160" style="s2">is their way which our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.300" end="00:42:38.730" style="s2">addicted to Christianity because it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.160" end="00:42:42.510" style="s2">been so into woven with our moral and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.730" end="00:42:44.910" style="s2">legal I think of it not economically</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.510" end="00:42:48.290" style="s2">although it is but it&#39;s it&#39;s so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.910" end="00:42:50.460" style="s2">interwoven into our moral and legal and</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.290" end="00:42:53.910" style="s2">spiritual and existential and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.460" end="00:42:56.250" style="s2">therapeutic you know infrastructure that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.910" end="00:42:57.930" style="s2">we don&#39;t we&#39;re sort of addicted to it so</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.250" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">even though a lot of people sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.930" end="00:43:02.369" style="s2">reject their propositional e there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:03.480" style="s2">still something analogous to what was</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.369" end="00:43:09.780" style="s2">happening with oil and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.480" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">infrastructure right yeah yeah like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.780" end="00:43:13.560" style="s2">things that I like about it babies say</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:15.930" style="s2">that were I what I noticed is something</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.560" end="00:43:18.119" style="s2">like everybody who consumed really truly</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.930" end="00:43:19.830" style="s2">feels from the participatory level up</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.119" end="00:43:21.510" style="s2">what I might call the essence not the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.830" end="00:43:23.490" style="s2">proposition or the uh the dogma</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.510" end="00:43:26.010" style="s2">Christianity should be agreeing with you</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.490" end="00:43:30.119" style="s2">yeah right right right you recognize</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.010" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">that is the good news yes because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.119" end="00:43:34.650" style="s2">simulation at the end of the day it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:38.430" style="s2">formalism it&#39;s a performance where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.650" end="00:43:39.210" style="s2">addicted to a performance of the rites</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.430" end="00:43:41.880" style="s2">and rituals</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.210" end="00:43:43.890" style="s2">there&#39;s of Christianity and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.880" end="00:43:46.140" style="s2">constrained by them that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.890" end="00:43:47.190" style="s2">prediction means all the way down to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.140" end="00:43:48.450" style="s2">propositional level so we were game</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.190" end="00:43:52.109" style="s2">where we&#39;re simulating we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.450" end="00:43:52.980" style="s2">through it and yeah that feels right to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.109" end="00:43:56.280" style="s2">me as you&#39;re saying is like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.980" end="00:43:58.109" style="s2">like heal the growing up as a not as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.280" end="00:44:00.359" style="s2">not as a Christian in in the West so I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.109" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">were really deep like okay what are</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.359" end="00:44:03.150" style="s2">these things like watching them from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.369" style="s2">outside and interacting as Christians</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.150" end="00:44:06.390" style="s2">don&#39;t okay so there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.369" end="00:44:07.440" style="s2">that I think is I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.390" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">pointing to something it&#39;s right but it</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.440" end="00:44:09.390" style="s2">takes it I get it I get what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.359" style="s2">actually be great</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.390" end="00:44:15.780" style="s2">careful there yeah well because I like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.359" end="00:44:17.490" style="s2">don&#39;t want to I&#39;m not trying to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.780" end="00:44:17.999" style="s2">the argument made by like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.490" end="00:44:20.249" style="s2">Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.999" end="00:44:22.859" style="s2">Tom Holland and others about how many</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.249" end="00:44:24.659" style="s2">how many things in our culture that even</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.859" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">the atheists or the secular people</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.659" end="00:44:30.869" style="s2">espouse and how it&#39;s ultimately you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:33.419" style="s2">derived and presupposes Christianity in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.869" end="00:44:35.729" style="s2">important ways right and and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.419" end="00:44:38.969" style="s2">want to acknowledge you know the light</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.729" end="00:44:41.189" style="s2">side of the force I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.969" end="00:44:43.439" style="s2">that that&#39;s false but what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.189" end="00:44:44.789" style="s2">expand the awareness of is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.439" end="00:44:47.159" style="s2">the dark side of the force</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.789" end="00:44:49.829" style="s2">to that with it&#39;s like the way we become</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.159" end="00:44:51.479" style="s2">addicted to oil we&#39;ve built it because</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.829" end="00:44:54.209" style="s2">because it has been so successfully</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.479" end="00:44:55.979" style="s2">woven into right the infrastructure of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.209" end="00:44:57.569" style="s2">our cultural you know cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.979" end="00:45:00.029" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.569" end="00:45:02.009" style="s2">reciprocally narrowed and addicted to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.029" end="00:45:04.289" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.009" end="00:45:06.269" style="s2">unthinkable for us even when we claim</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.289" end="00:45:07.379" style="s2">propositional e2b atheists about how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.269" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">break out of it and I think this was</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.379" end="00:45:11.219" style="s2">Michy&#39;s when this is part of Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:13.139" style="s2">concern as I mean people really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.219" end="00:45:15.029" style="s2">get what they&#39;re talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.139" end="00:45:17.389" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to say God is dead or</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.029" end="00:45:19.739" style="s2">there is no God and stuff like that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.389" end="00:45:21.239" style="s2">just wanted I just wanted to sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.739" end="00:45:23.429" style="s2">just wanted to counterbalance these</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.239" end="00:45:25.289" style="s2">arguments made by you know well you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.429" end="00:45:27.419" style="s2">all these good things that you like</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.289" end="00:45:29.009" style="s2">they&#39;re dependent on Christianity well</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.419" end="00:45:33.239" style="s2">you know all these good things that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.009" end="00:45:36.149" style="s2">like are dependent on oil right but you</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.239" end="00:45:37.949" style="s2">know that dependency can go from being</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.149" end="00:45:39.809" style="s2">you know a positive thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.949" end="00:45:43.159" style="s2">celebrate to being exactly what you say</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.809" end="00:45:45.929" style="s2">you can come a point where oh no oh no I</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.159" end="00:45:48.239" style="s2">know I&#39;m so reciprocally narrowed</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.929" end="00:45:51.059" style="s2">because of the dependency that I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.239" end="00:45:53.219" style="s2">like an addictive dependency like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.059" end="00:45:56.039" style="s2">know substance dependence Oh editor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.219" end="00:45:58.289" style="s2">note to the extent that this to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.039" end="00:45:59.969" style="s2">shared more broadly yes I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.289" end="00:46:05.459" style="s2">very important to bracket the last five</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.969" end="00:46:07.079" style="s2">minutes of conversation that this is one</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.459" end="00:46:08.909" style="s2">must be very careful to listen very</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.079" end="00:46:11.309" style="s2">closely to where it is it&#39;s going to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.909" end="00:46:15.029" style="s2">yes thank you for that thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.309" end="00:46:17.819" style="s2">that Jordan it is this is a reuleaux</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.029" end="00:46:20.039" style="s2">make a space for me right this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.819" end="00:46:23.039" style="s2">very subtle thing that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.039" end="00:46:25.859" style="s2">pointing at yes and if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.039" end="00:46:28.199" style="s2">reacting to it what I would suggest and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.859" end="00:46:31.260" style="s2">hope is to step away and recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.199" end="00:46:33.720" style="s2">Johnny B is operating a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.260" end="00:46:35.490" style="s2">yes I am let us try to work with that to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.720" end="00:46:37.020" style="s2">find out what is being pulled out here</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.490" end="00:46:38.790" style="s2">because real it&#39;s rich there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.020" end="00:46:41.640" style="s2">really good and meaningful that all</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.790" end="00:46:42.660" style="s2">right editor&#39;s note and bracket no thank</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.640" end="00:46:44.780" style="s2">you for saying that and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.660" end="00:46:47.820" style="s2">tried to caveat it by saying look and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.780" end="00:46:49.530" style="s2">explicitly acknowledging that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.820" end="00:46:50.820" style="s2">you know like I said the light side of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.530" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">the force I was using that metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.820" end="00:46:55.770" style="s2">right you know that there&#39;s all of this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:59.370" style="s2">I&#39;m not denying any of that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.770" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">trying to say like if we like what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.370" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">and I are engaging but there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:06.210" style="s2">we have to broaden the framing or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:08.700" style="s2">not going to get out of how we&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.210" end="00:47:10.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s all I was trying to do but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.700" end="00:47:12.300" style="s2">thank you for your editors note because</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.050" end="00:47:14.460" style="s2">it&#39;s much appreciated because I was</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.300" end="00:47:15.510" style="s2">hesitant as you know I was hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.460" end="00:47:17.460" style="s2">say this and I was trying to be very</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.510" end="00:47:21.450" style="s2">careful and so you acknowledging that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.460" end="00:47:22.980" style="s2">explicitly was also there&#39;s some shared</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.450" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">context or search terms that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.980" end="00:47:27.540" style="s2">make things but again back to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:29.460" style="s2">being a little simpler which is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.540" end="00:47:31.410" style="s2">meaning of this notion theory is as</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.460" end="00:47:33.540" style="s2">least as far as I understand it as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.410" end="00:47:35.430" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion right is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.540" end="00:47:36.510" style="s2">in some sense endeavoring to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.430" end="00:47:38.910" style="s2">to put things in the back in their</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.510" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">proper place it&#39;s to get them going the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.910" end="00:47:46.530" style="s2">right way did he go in the right way and</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:49.710" style="s2">so for example if you are living truly</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.530" end="00:47:51.840" style="s2">living Christian moment a moment from</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.710" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">the inside out in in relationships life</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.840" end="00:47:55.560" style="s2">real life like actual life like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.210" style="s2">tragedies of your existence and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.560" end="00:48:00.030" style="s2">making meaning you&#39;re truly making</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.210" end="00:48:03.330" style="s2">meaning out of that then you&#39;re fine</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.030" end="00:48:06.780" style="s2">totally and I again I I say this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.330" end="00:48:08.610" style="s2">repeatedly I know because I&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.780" end="00:48:10.530" style="s2">people and I&#39;m in discussion with them</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.610" end="00:48:12.980" style="s2">that there are many people who can</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.530" end="00:48:15.720" style="s2">individually turn to Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.980" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">spiral up to use our language I see that</p>

<p begin="00:48:35.610" end="00:48:40.140" style="s2">out how to do this we just find it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.860" end="00:48:42.150" style="s2">improbable that&#39;s right that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.140" end="00:48:43.350" style="s2">the same thing actually I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.150" end="00:48:44.890" style="s2">throw something out that I&#39;ve run into</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.350" end="00:48:46.510" style="s2">recently and we just talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.890" end="00:48:49.300" style="s2">just say hey here&#39;s the here&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.060" end="00:49:03.400" style="s2">like this in that anyone who truly truly</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.360" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">limbs their religion wherever it happens</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.740" end="00:49:44.380" style="s2">to to bring into the light like the</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.800" end="00:49:46.300" style="s2">sense thing that I have yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.380" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">possible this could totally you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.300" end="00:49:49.390" style="s2">this totally right and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.640" end="00:49:55.120" style="s2">with the way you&#39;ve just articulated</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:57.910" style="s2">that I really haven&#39;t any idea how to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.120" end="00:49:59.020" style="s2">it I&#39;ve got all kinds of concepts and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.910" end="00:50:01.150" style="s2">notions and I&#39;ve tried all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.020" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">sorts of things but this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.150" end="00:50:06.250" style="s2">really helps a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:07.300" style="s2">I mean I don&#39;t know how to engineer the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.250" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">whole thing I&#39;m having lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.300" end="00:50:10.540" style="s2">conversations I&#39;m having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:12.310" style="s2">with people who like rave kelly and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.540" end="00:50:13.870" style="s2">others who are building communities you</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.310" end="00:50:17.650" style="s2">know Daniel Thorson people like that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.870" end="00:50:19.630" style="s2">doing all of that I&#39;m try I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.650" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">you know in a really comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.630" end="00:50:24.250" style="s2">manner reverse-engineer a meta cycle</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.770" style="s2">technology for exactly the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.250" end="00:50:29.050" style="s2">you articulated so long ago and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.770" end="00:50:32.290" style="s2">the find it you know do that the project</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.050" end="00:50:35.080" style="s2">of dialectic or you know dialectic 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.290" end="00:50:38.680" style="s2">or something that is gonna view that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.080" end="00:50:41.050" style="s2">role for us other than that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.680" end="00:50:42.460" style="s2">what to do like you but I keep wanting</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.050" end="00:50:45.060" style="s2">to have these conversations I keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.460" end="00:50:48.610" style="s2">wanting to try and reverse engineer as</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.060" end="00:50:49.990" style="s2">much as I can because you know we both</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.610" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">agree that we&#39;re in an urgent situation</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.990" end="00:50:55.300" style="s2">we don&#39;t have we don&#39;t have the luxury</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:57.300" style="s2">of a lot of time so</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.300" end="00:50:59.700" style="s2">I mean what I do</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.300" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">Jordan is I have DAF I have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.700" end="00:51:04.170" style="s2">that you know what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">there&#39;s the it there&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.170" end="00:51:07.560" style="s2">starting to become self-organizing it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:09.480" style="s2">feels like it has the potential to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.560" end="00:51:12.270" style="s2">autopoietic and it definitely feels like</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.480" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s reciprocal opening spiraling up and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.270" end="00:51:17.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s where I&#39;ve gone from being</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:19.320" style="s2">bleak to being hopeful not cheerful</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.400" end="00:51:21.030" style="s2">because the world is still a you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.320" end="00:51:24.390" style="s2">dark place in a lot of ways for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.030" end="00:51:26.220" style="s2">people but being hopeful is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.390" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">ours now something you know st. Paul</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.220" end="00:51:31.470" style="s2">talked about and you know faith is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:33.000" style="s2">you know the evidence of things unseen</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.470" end="00:51:34.860" style="s2">or the hope and if you make that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.000" end="00:51:37.080" style="s2">propositional it&#39;s just a loopy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.860" end="00:51:38.820" style="s2">prescribe but if it&#39;s like this what</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.080" end="00:51:40.620" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about about now the sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.820" end="00:51:42.870" style="s2">of the off you&#39;re right and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.620" end="00:51:45.120" style="s2">that you owe a tie there&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.870" end="00:51:49.860" style="s2">it&#39;s gelling it&#39;s right there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.120" end="00:51:51.180" style="s2">becoming a B it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.860" end="00:51:52.800" style="s2">priests ages that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.180" end="00:51:55.190" style="s2">autopoietic in a way that I can taste</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.800" end="00:51:58.080" style="s2">right and that gives me that gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.190" end="00:52:00.810" style="s2">directed hope then I sort of can give a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.080" end="00:52:04.530" style="s2">new meaning to his phrase and his</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.810" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">understanding and so and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.530" end="00:52:08.700" style="s2">like to emphasize the adjective rather</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:11.250" style="s2">than the now not faith but faithfulness</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.700" end="00:52:13.230" style="s2">that sense of you know because when</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.250" end="00:52:14.520" style="s2">you&#39;re faithful to your wife it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.230" end="00:52:16.140" style="s2">like just well I believe these things</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.520" end="00:52:17.460" style="s2">about her and I will always believe them</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.140" end="00:52:20.340" style="s2">that&#39;s not what it means</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.460" end="00:52:23.730" style="s2">it means that your God that you are you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.340" end="00:52:26.190" style="s2">know you you sense an autopoietic thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.730" end="00:52:29.070" style="s2">growing between you and her that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.190" end="00:52:33.570" style="s2">valuable to both of you in an evolving</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.070" end="00:52:35.010" style="s2">spiraling upward way that is so like so</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.570" end="00:52:35.610" style="s2">real that&#39;s the reality that is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.010" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.610" end="00:52:39.870" style="s2">yes yeah that&#39;s actually such a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:42.060" style="s2">thing with grasp you wonder if that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.870" end="00:52:44.910" style="s2">lands for people so just to say it back</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.060" end="00:52:46.950" style="s2">to you sure let&#39;s go with model one</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.910" end="00:52:48.990" style="s2">right and mother one in this case is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.950" end="00:52:50.760" style="s2">gonna be propositional so for model of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.990" end="00:52:52.530" style="s2">one is something like I&#39;ve said some</p>
