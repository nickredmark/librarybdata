<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">to talk about was the fact that how we</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">create things now is we have a someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:35.969" style="s2">who has an idea they create a product</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">they have to create their certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.969" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">of them to put them in stores then</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:41.250" style="s2">people decide like they find out through</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.079" end="00:00:46.140" style="s2">looks all of that there are so many in</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">efficiencies in that cycle that we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.140" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">definitely address one of the big ones</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">is the exchanging that so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">saying I&#39;m a producer I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">produce X number of cogs you say I am a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">called user I use this many copies a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:05.850" style="s2">year please make them for me where can I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">get them made that they fit what I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.850" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">to have and so you reverse it so it does</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">it you can&#39;t get things as instantly but</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.500" style="s2">you&#39;re able to have a feedback cycle so</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">maybe you do eventually realize that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.500" end="00:01:21.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a million cogs that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">made per day per year and have them</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.060" end="00:01:24.990" style="s2">ready to go and when it exceeds that</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:27.509" style="s2">sorry you&#39;re waiting because they&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:35.189" style="s2">making ten million hoping that million</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">sell every month and I believe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.189" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">much better way of doing it there&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:41.610" style="s2">it just works better on every level and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">the more you&#39;re able to communicate what</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.610" end="00:01:48.990" style="s2">it is you actually want your gob how</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">many cog things I look things are going</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.990" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:59.140" style="s2">economics use a lot of cob knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.950" end="00:02:02.229" style="s2">ease cog examples so flipping it being</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.140" end="00:02:03.670" style="s2">able to say okay well I mean Kickstarter</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.229" end="00:02:04.899" style="s2">kinda does that when kids Turner comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.670" end="00:02:07.210" style="s2">up with something in there is going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.899" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">sell ten thousand items but then it ends</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.210" end="00:02:09.700" style="s2">up getting more because they&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:11.049" style="s2">saying I&#39;m going to sell ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.700" end="00:02:13.540" style="s2">who am i selling into are running ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.049" end="00:02:15.790" style="s2">thousand it is kind of the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.540" end="00:02:17.500" style="s2">where they&#39;re saying how many people</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.790" end="00:02:19.959" style="s2">would want this if we made it if ten</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.500" end="00:02:24.190" style="s2">thousand say yes then we do ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.959" end="00:02:25.660" style="s2">100,000 100,000 and but doing that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.190" end="00:02:27.610" style="s2">doing that for projects where it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.579" end="00:02:52.180" style="s2">do they have them in my size you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:53.410" style="s2">someone who has actually creating them</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.180" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">for that size specifically is because</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.410" end="00:02:58.569" style="s2">we&#39;re creating a thousand of them at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:00.250" style="s2">that exact size it&#39;s super cheap Scott</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.569" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">could quality whatever happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.250" end="00:03:05.590" style="s2">that you value then it&#39;s offering you or</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:07.480" style="s2">it is someone who&#39;s making you know 100</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.590" end="00:03:09.430" style="s2">in every size do you want one of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.480" end="00:03:14.410" style="s2">hundred and then anyway so figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.430" end="00:03:17.530" style="s2">as a user how many are needed and wanted</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.410" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">and then creating that many and doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.530" end="00:03:20.380" style="s2">that in the most efficient manner and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">being able to help all the way long</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.380" end="00:03:23.560" style="s2">lines if you&#39;re a producer of it if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.780" style="s2">want to make a small batch of things and</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:29.829" style="s2">sell them who would most be able to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.780" end="00:03:31.870" style="s2">them what&#39;s the price point all of if</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.829" end="00:03:34.060" style="s2">you make ten thousand for people is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.870" end="00:03:38.470" style="s2">feasible but also like cannot bring the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.060" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">price point down and so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.470" end="00:03:44.349" style="s2">flipping the trash system instead by</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">saying we&#39;re not going to create things</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.349" end="00:03:50.650" style="s2">that aren&#39;t usable because people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:53.620" style="s2">want them rocking over produce say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.650" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">stopping the overproduction of items as</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.620" end="00:03:56.430" style="s2">I did worth it</p>
