<p begin="00:06:15.680" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">i can just say yeah yeah this is a book</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:23.440" style="s2">actually my mom pointed me to it in</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">high school originally published 1955</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.440" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">1955.</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">my mom i think recognizing that i was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">you know different or something</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:35.840" style="s2">did not everyone in your life noticed</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:39.120" style="s2">that i guess they did and that i had</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.840" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">uh something of a problem with authority</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.120" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">yeah a little bit of a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">authority thought this book might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">just the thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.840" style="s2">and it happens that um you know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.840" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">resonated with me quite strongly so one</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:52.960" style="s2">of the frustrations that i have</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">is that the book is actually not all</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.960" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">that well known in the modern era people</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">catch 22 itself but they don&#39;t they know</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">the concept the central</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.800" style="s2">they don&#39;t even necessarily know what</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:04.240" style="s2">the catch is but i know that a catch-22</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.800" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s like a kafka trap</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.240" end="00:07:09.599" style="s2">basically and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">um the throughout the evergreen episode</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.599" end="00:07:14.800" style="s2">i kept wanting to raise</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.280" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">this uh reference because it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">fit perfectly but i knew nobody was</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">going to get it wow</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">and then this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:24.400" style="s2">this is the problem with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">loss of understanding of history right</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.400" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">and and of historical texts and this</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">yeah this is not that deep history this</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">is what 65 years ago that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:34.319" style="s2">published first um and so the central</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.840" style="s2">catch 22</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.319" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">is if memory serves um if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.840" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">are uh sane enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">to if you&#39;re crazy you don&#39;t have to fly</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:47.280" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t want to fly that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">evidence that you&#39;re sane</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.280" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">yeah there it is you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to go</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:54.000" style="s2">that&#39;s some catch yeah yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.160" style="s2">best there is</p>

<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">in deep admiration</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">and uh and concern for his and his</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">caused to follow along um no no ideology</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:38.880" style="s2">there there are no ideological or belief</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">bounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.880" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">on whether or not such a strategy or</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">such tactics will be effective</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.039" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">and so you know when we are told ah but</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">you know this isn&#39;t that because those</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">people believed something else</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter tactic and belief are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s really i think no</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.039" style="s2">relationship between them inherently</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">at least over in in this kind of space</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.039" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">yeah the irony is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">i i must have had this thought a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:11.120" style="s2">times in the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">is that what the folks who are deploying</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.120" end="00:20:18.320" style="s2">one wrong idea after another really need</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">is a high quality college education</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.320" end="00:20:24.960" style="s2">right and the fact is you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:27.120" style="s2">normal it&#39;s childlike but it is normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.960" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">to have this sense that your cause is</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.120" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">different and therefore it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">vulnerable to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.240" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">this you know caricature but</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">you know just the simple benefit that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">would come from people</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">understanding the rawsian veil of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">you want to give a two-sentence</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:45.520" style="s2">description of it yeah the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.520" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">legitimate policy is policy that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.960" style="s2">indifferent to who is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:54.640" style="s2">deploying it if the value of the policy</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.960" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">you&#39;re advocating requires that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.640" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">the one administering and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">as soon as the enemy is administrating</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:00.559" style="s2">it you&#39;re going to hate it um then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t want it so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.559" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">so that is the that is the relative</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">unveil of ignorance that we should all</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">aspire to and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">we should seek in our in our laws and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">our in our degrees right it&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">stable thing because otherwise what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">get is everybody advocating policy that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">puts them</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">ahead while they&#39;re you know nominally</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">in a position</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">to do it or in a power situation that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.600" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">they can pull it off and then they</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">suffer from it on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.480" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">and so you know that one idea has just</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:27.600" style="s2">tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">power for for one thing you see it in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:32.799" style="s2">places you don&#39;t even really expect it</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:33.760" style="s2">like the the claim that we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.799" end="00:21:35.520" style="s2">make that people</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.760" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">end up scratching their heads about with</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.520" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">respect to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">uh patriarchy right that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:42.080" style="s2">something hollow about this claim of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:45.280" style="s2">patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.080" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">what is it it&#39;s that the genes live</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.280" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">in a rosian veil of ignorance situation</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">which is if they make rules</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">that put males at advantage because</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">they&#39;re in male bodies in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">do so</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">then the half the time they end up in</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">female bodies they suffer the downside</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean that the rules are</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">fair but it does mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">it isn&#39;t that the genes have put men</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">ahead of women because the genes are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">neither</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">the genes are both okay i don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">want to spend much time here but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">my pushback to that would be the genes</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">uh so long as they are transmitted into</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">future generations don&#39;t actually give a</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">damn about what the individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">lives are that they are contained in and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">so the fact that there have been</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">clearly many societies through history</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">that have put women into a position of</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.679" style="s2">being denigrated uh through any number</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">of mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">uh would would seem to kind of put the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">lie to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:44.640" style="s2">to what you just said partially</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">precisely because individual lives</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.640" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">still end up propagating the genes in</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">the bodies</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">and you can see how a proper college</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:54.080" style="s2">education would emerge from exactly this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.400" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">discussion because the point is as soon</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.080" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">as you see that the genes do live in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">situation and yet you have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:01.679" style="s2">where things are unfair in a predictable</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.679" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">why because the individuals don&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:06.400" style="s2">and then you start to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t matter from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.400" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">of the genes which is not interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:12.559" style="s2">but it is true</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:15.520" style="s2">right yes then the question is uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">okay what are the genes up to and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.520" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">much do i like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">and the answer is they&#39;re up to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">things and more than half of it you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.960" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">and what does that mean about our</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.960" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">ability to do something different which</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">gets you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">free well and all of the other things</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">well and there and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">exactly and i feel like this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:31.919" style="s2">the places that we started almost every</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">single</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.919" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">you know college program that we ever</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">taught which was</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">we want to provide you with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">evolutionary toolkit to understand as</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:41.840" style="s2">much as possible about what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:45.600" style="s2">you do and why you do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.840" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">so that you are most fully armed</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.600" end="00:23:50.159" style="s2">to do that which is against the will of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">your genes</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.159" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">when the genes have things in mind in</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">mind in quotes</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:23:57.760" style="s2">um that are actually not honorable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:01.279" style="s2">not good for society or yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.760" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">or both right and um</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.279" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">to cap it off the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:09.279" style="s2">recognition of what the genes should</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">want if their purpose is to advance</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.279" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">themselves into the future</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">as far into the future as they can get</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">then it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">ultimately cause them to favor</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">patterns that result in people looking</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.919" end="00:24:31.200" style="s2">versus a collaborator which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">the basis of</p>

<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">of it&#39;s certainly the earliest types</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:00.720" style="s2">it is that does not make it honorable</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">and indeed it is one of the things that</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">pretending it doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.200" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">makes it more likely that it will</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:09.279" style="s2">continue to exist and if you were gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">fight it</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.279" end="00:25:12.799" style="s2">the way to fight it would be to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.400" style="s2">understand what it was made of and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.799" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">what the countervailing forces are</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.400" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">because the counterfailing failing force</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:21.760" style="s2">and the united states is the prime</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.760" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">with stabilizing that countervailing</p>

<p begin="00:25:28.720" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">about this country so</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.640" end="00:25:37.600" style="s2">the irony of a bunch of woke people</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">attacking uh the foundational principles</p>

<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">and the epistemology on which it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:46.720" style="s2">founded when the alternative is actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">let&#39;s calm down and have these</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.720" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">discussions with full nuance and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">will discover</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">that the enemy isn&#39;t what you thought it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">was and the solution isn&#39;t what you</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.120" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">think it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:57.279" style="s2">and there is a way to get there but</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">there&#39;s no shortcut</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.279" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">right right so actually um i know</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">we weren&#39;t going to go here just yet but</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">um this might be</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:10.480" style="s2">the moment uh just to show one</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">one new thing that&#39;s happening with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.480" end="00:26:16.640" style="s2">woke uh hold on just a second zach</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:20.400" style="s2">um if i can pull this up here</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.640" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">okay here we go um so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.400" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">who are these people this is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">mathematical association of america has</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">tweeted it is time for all members of</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:28.880" style="s2">our profession to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">mathematics is created by humans</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.880" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">and therefore inherently carries human</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:34.080" style="s2">biases until this occurs our community</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">and our students cannot reach full</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.080" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">okay we&#39;re done zach we&#39;re done here</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">um so this this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">classic conflation that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">over in wokespace</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">right the idea that the language that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:53.360" style="s2">use to describe something</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">is the thing itself that has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.360" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">discovered</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">over in science and math land in general</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">we are doing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:03.520" style="s2">discovering not creating so math is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">discovered math is the underlying truth</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.520" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:08.159" style="s2">and the language that we use you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">the fact that we ended up with you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.159" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">newton&#39;s version of calculus and not</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">leibniz&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:14.640" style="s2">both of those are social constructs both</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">of those descriptions of calculus are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.640" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">social constructs but the calculus</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:19.520" style="s2">underlying</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">that was true between both of them is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.520" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">true regardless of which human</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">language you use to describe it if the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">mathematical association of america is</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">actually confused on this front they</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">need a complete reorganization</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">and really you just don&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">business doing math if you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">true right</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">no we we need a new one if we knew what</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">if the organization that is the flag</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">bearer</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">for mathematical whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">um association of america is confused on</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">this point then what we need</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:55.760" style="s2">is a different mathematical association</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">of america that isn&#39;t confused on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.760" end="00:28:00.000" style="s2">point because this point is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">you know at the foundation yes right</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.000" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">exactly and so you know run this little</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">experiment it&#39;s not math but</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">actually you can do it in math space uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">the aliens step off the spaceship</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">they have had no contact with our</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">epistemology they just</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">see that something interesting is going</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">on in the earth they come to visit right</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">we put our scientists in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">their scientists</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:24.159" style="s2">do they agree on the value of pi</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">my sense is they will agree exactly on</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.159" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">the value of pi which is not to say you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">know obviously it isn&#39;t endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">repeating a non-repeating decimal so</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.240" style="s2">a precise value we can agree to but as</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">many decimal places as they will go</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.240" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">once we figure out the conversion factor</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">you know if they&#39;re 12</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">digited creatures and they use base 12</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">then oh you&#39;re talking about the actual</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">value of pi i thought you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">sort of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">the value of pi and having gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">where they are which is also true but</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">they will 100 not only will they have</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.200" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">value for pi that we have but they will</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.200" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">also be using it in the same ways that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">we do because it is</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">necessary in order to do the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">work that you would need to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:07.200" style="s2">to get a spaceship across a galaxy or</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">wherever these imagined aliens came from</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.200" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">so they will have gotten ever greater</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">precision</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">on pi we will agree on the value itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">there could if you want to steal man the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">position of the mathematical association</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">there are actually two ways that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:23.600" style="s2">are probably more than two ways but</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">there are two major ways</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">that different cultures came up with</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">their approximations for pi</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:30.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an inscribed polygon way which</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">is the greek way</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.960" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">yeah and there is an inscribed and is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">outscribed the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">excrement excrimed i don&#39;t know way in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">that the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:42.080" style="s2">did it where they used two sets of</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.080" end="00:29:45.120" style="s2">the language that&#39;s the description of</p>

<p begin="00:29:45.120" end="00:29:50.799" style="s2">well it&#39;s a process that undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">has a method so in this case it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.799" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">method that results in a language</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">but the method is discovering the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">underlying truth and the language</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">describes the method which describes the</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">underlying truth and we all it all</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">all roads keep on pointing back to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">underlying truth and if what if there</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an underlying truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">then i don&#39;t know maybe we&#39;d be doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">social modern sociology or something and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">we actually know some good modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.840" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">sociologists but mostly</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">that field has been totally captured and</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">corrupted and it really is just a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:17.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">social uh constructions that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.760" end="00:30:20.960" style="s2">meaningless but you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">do the experiment yourself you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.960" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">calculate pi</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">both ways the chinese way in the greek</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">way and you get the same value</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">and the aliens they may have a third way</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">or they may have settled on one of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:32.880" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">and they will have the same value as</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.880" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">well and so the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">tells you that it isn&#39;t about who</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">described it</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.039" style="s2">right and it also you know it say the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">aliens</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.039" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">landed and uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">and they happen to use the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:49.600" style="s2">method uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make the chinese method</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.600" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">it means that&#39;s what they discovered and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:54.159" style="s2">maybe it was better for their</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.159" end="00:30:57.360" style="s2">uh and you know whatever planet they</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:30:58.799" style="s2">came from but</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.360" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">the fact that we have two different</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.799" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">discoveries on this planet and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t know you know did the maya</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">discover a third you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">the maya had astronomers the turks may</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">have had another</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">right so maybe there are yet more ways</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">to calculate pi and if the aliens</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">happened to use one of the ones that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">use that does not mean right away ah</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">well they got here therefore they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:26.640" style="s2">better therefore it&#39;s best like no</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">as always it&#39;s context specific and when</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.640" end="00:31:29.679" style="s2">it&#39;s math and you have multiple ways of</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">getting there</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.679" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">one of them may be better for some</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">circumstances and one of them may be</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">globally better</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">but you don&#39;t necessarily know that just</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">because someone</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">you know who arrived from a different</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">planet is using that for instance right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">and you know the fact is the inferior</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:45.039" style="s2">method still gets there it gets there</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">slower and i think in this case actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.039" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s the greek method</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">which gets there slower because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">starts you know if you inscribe a square</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">inside a circle you get a very rough</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">approximation</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">of pi so you keep adding sides to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">polygon in order to get a better and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">better approximation</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">which is how you get further and further</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">into the decimal places</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">so one of these ways can be better but</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">discovering a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">right you know you may approach a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">mountain from a really arduous path</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">where you may approach it straight away</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">same damn mountain</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:17.519" style="s2">right that&#39;s good yeah and uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">and we could do this with chemistry too</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.519" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">right so the aliens step off the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">spaceship what are the chances that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">will agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">you know on the fact of there being an</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">element iron right they will have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">different name for it but we will agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">on how many</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">uh you know uh nuclear particles it has</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">and how many electrons it&#39;s typically</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">orbited by</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">and we will agree on what the uh the i</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">the isotopes will be and how common they</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">yeah so anyway this thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">just tells you</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">this kind of formulation is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">attractive right oh well if people</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">discovered it then their biases are in</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.159" style="s2">it and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">the closer you get to the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.159" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">bedrock the less true that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.559" style="s2">right right yeah and especially when</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">there are multiple roots in</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.559" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">and they&#39;ve all arrived at the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:08.880" style="s2">answer right exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:10.240" style="s2">okay so the question now is where do we</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.880" end="00:33:12.960" style="s2">go from here</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.240" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">um we have several issues we want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.960" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">discuss</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:17.279" style="s2">we want to talk about i&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">concerned about it but i think we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.279" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">to talk</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">about the um the events unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">in the presidential election space</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:31.200" style="s2">okay with us exactly one month out</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">so we had that rather remarkable debate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.200" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">seems to be almost universal agreement</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">about its nature</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">i do wonder how much of a thing like</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:43.200" style="s2">that is the result of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">people formulating their opinion</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.200" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">in concert with each other right because</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">people are paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">commentaries that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">yeah no this is i mean this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">the very many</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">problems with a social media era when</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">very little time almost no one</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re watching the debate</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.320" style="s2">you have access to the constant</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">shattering and analysis</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.320" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">of lots of other people and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">actively decide i&#39;m not going there</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to make i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">fill my head with what other people</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">think of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">until i have not only watched this but</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">sat on my</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">my sense of what it might mean for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">while preferably you know many</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">hours preferably sleep on it and see if</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">your position position has changed</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">before you start filling your head with</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">what other people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">think about it and almost no one does</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">on any number of topics and it really it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">contributes</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">to a uh a less rigorous analytical</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:45.599" style="s2">uh absolutely and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">practiced art keeping your opinion</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.599" end="00:34:48.720" style="s2">isolated long enough that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:50.879" style="s2">correct for</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.720" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s opinion collapsing into</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.879" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">one because they formulated it with each</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">other in their ear</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">this is going to seem totally an aside</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:00.400" style="s2">and it won&#39;t take more than</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:00.640" style="s2">30 seconds but i&#39;m reminded when i was</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.400" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.640" end="00:35:04.320" style="s2">quito with my students from my first</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:08.480" style="s2">study abroad in ecuador</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.320" end="00:35:10.560" style="s2">and would have been 20 14 maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.480" end="00:35:11.599" style="s2">um very first day i was out with three</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">students and we were mugged</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.599" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">at knifepoint and i&#39;ve written about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">after it happened and before the police</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">showed up and before me</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">right in the middle of the thing but</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:24.720" style="s2">after all the danger was over</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:27.599" style="s2">uh i said to my three students</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.720" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">let&#39;s not talk about it just try to find</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.599" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">space in this crazy street scene right</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.359" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">now just even take two minutes to figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">out what you think you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">about what just happened and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to be talk we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">going to be telling this story for weeks</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:38.720" style="s2">now because we was just at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.720" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">this trip we had what 21 people that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">were going to go back to the host to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">this happened right let us let us first</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">figure out what we think we know without</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">any other input aside from our own</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">senses and our own experiences</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">and the fact that our stories converged</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">and then where they were different it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">was because you know for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">i didn&#39;t have any color for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">thing like the entire scene was</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">remembered in black and white</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">and for someone else they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:04.880" style="s2">any you know any i don&#39;t remember what</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.880" end="00:36:10.480" style="s2">any smells and um and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:11.359" style="s2">we had this concerted understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.480" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">the event</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.359" end="00:36:15.040" style="s2">which if we had just started talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">about it right away we would have had</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.040" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">very very much lower sense of whether or</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">not that is actually what had happened</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.920" style="s2">or if one person&#39;s dominant sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">what had happened had simply overridden</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.920" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">everyone else&#39;s sense</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">well and i think it actually hints at</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.680" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:35.760" style="s2">tension between the two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">history so yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.760" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">i will argue that history</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">is the fact that we use one term for two</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">is very um</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">likely to cause conflict and it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:51.599" style="s2">causing conflict so for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">you want to define the two types of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.599" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">history you&#39;re talking about um</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">christopher columbus discovered america</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of history what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.280" style="s2">history it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:06.880" style="s2">it&#39;s history like humans discovered math</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.280" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">yes it&#39;s eurocentric</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.880" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">and fictionalized right</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">um so we have the sense of christopher</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:15.040" style="s2">columbus</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">you know arriving on the shores of north</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.040" end="00:37:19.839" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">the um you know and already that story</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">is just garbage</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.400" style="s2">right right that didn&#39;t even happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">right right um first of all there was no</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.400" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">such person</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">cristobal colon was his name why we take</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:32.800" style="s2">why we anglicize a name a historical</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:35.680" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.800" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">right um makes no sense but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.680" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">in that case is you are creating a</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">narrative for a population</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">now that narrative is completely at odds</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:49.520" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">the um formation of nations</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.520" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">that are pluralistic right in other</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:56.880" style="s2">words the idea that we send</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">that we americans celebrate columbus day</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.880" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">is preposterous even if you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">celebrate something</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.520" style="s2">about the historical fact of this person</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">arriving here because it</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.520" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">was meaningful arriving in this you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">hemisphere um you would celebrate the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">historical aspect to it not the</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:15.680" style="s2">fictionalized narrative because that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">fictionalized narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.680" end="00:38:21.599" style="s2">is uh obviously in conflict with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">well-being of a large population of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.599" end="00:38:23.920" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">right the people who were here before</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">him right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:30.240" style="s2">my point would be one thing history does</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:31.040" style="s2">is it generates a story on which we</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.240" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.040" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a self-serving story on which we</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">agree and therefore the question of who</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:39.119" style="s2">self is matters and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">question of history which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.119" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">what actually happened and why right</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">what actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:45.359" style="s2">so your first your first kind of history</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">which is actually happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.359" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">later it&#39;s sort of an um an overlay is</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">which serves a purpose of basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">directing a population</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:55.839" style="s2">and the friend and the second one that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">you&#39;re about to talk about is at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.839" end="00:38:59.839" style="s2">trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">um to describe factually what happened</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.839" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">with the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:04.480" style="s2">that there is a kind of heisenbergian</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">truth about</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.480" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">like where you were standing and what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">is that you know the very act of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:13.040" style="s2">can can change what you understand to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">true one thing i&#39;ll disagree with you on</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.040" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">is that i don&#39;t think the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">thing is an overlay on top of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">what actually happened i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">actually a primary driver</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">and that the thing that you were as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.320" style="s2">scientist protecting against</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">with you and your students formulating</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">your view of what took place separately</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">before you ever talked about it was the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:34.000" style="s2">fact that it is very normal</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:35.599" style="s2">for human beings to settle on a story of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.000" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">what happened and the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.599" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">about that story is not that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">accurate</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">right now not not in my case but in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">case of people</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">coming together and agreeing on a shared</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">narrative and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:47.119" style="s2">moving about in the world without</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.040" style="s2">sharing right if you normally have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.119" end="00:39:49.680" style="s2">something happen to you with a group of</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.040" end="00:39:52.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.680" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">you deciding together what it was is</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.160" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">partially you</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.960" style="s2">recovering some factual information and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:59.200" style="s2">partially you figuring out what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.960" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">best story going forward</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.200" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">they&#39;re interleaved exactly and so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">actual study of history requires you not</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">to do that just as the actual study of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">science requires you to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">what will advance your career in order</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:13.440" style="s2">to see what&#39;s actually true</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">even if it embarrasses you right so that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.440" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">suspension of the normal</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">instincts is necessary to the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:20.640" style="s2">problem of sorting out how things</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">actually work so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.640" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">you know make a longer term kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">progress it&#39;s an enlightened kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">insight rather than a self-serving kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">of insight</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">so all right two kinds of history</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">in light of the um unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">presidential debate this last week right</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">the part of the problem is that our our</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">current environment now</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">allows arbitrarily large numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">people to compile their sense of what is</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:51.440" style="s2">in real time you know people are on</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:53.520" style="s2">twitter and elsewhere discussing what is</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.960" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">immediately and that that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.680" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">corrosive</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:04.160" style="s2">to the normal process of having a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:05.280" style="s2">of different opinions about what was</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.160" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">said and what it meant</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.280" end="00:41:08.960" style="s2">and what that implies going forward</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">which would then force a discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.960" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">would be at some level interesting we</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">and went straight to the knee-jerk</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">interpretation in this case maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:17.680" style="s2">two knee-jerk interpretations depending</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">upon</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.680" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">uh you know which twitter you&#39;re paying</p>

<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:34.000" style="s2">being at the end something like this um</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">and then she says i&#39;m running across</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.000" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">a cohort of people that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">thousands strong and it&#39;s a lot stronger</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">than that but seems to be thousands</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">who detest crt but also seem to be</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">right right and so many people myself</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">included</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">responded and said yes we&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:54.160" style="s2">we&#39;re reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re all across the political</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.160" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">spectrum but yes some of us</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.680" end="00:42:59.440" style="s2">are indeed democrats and always have</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">been and can&#39;t promise we always will be</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.440" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">um you know this this is true and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.640" style="s2">please you know please would you would</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">you listen would you be up for a</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.640" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">conversation i actually specifically</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">invited her to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">to talk if she was willing and she</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:15.359" style="s2">deleted the tweet</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">so and that i would point out is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.359" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">perfect analog for what happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">throughout the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">riots where progress could be made with</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">an individual very briefly but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">durable</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">because they would get pulled back to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">something yeah right so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">tragic that she sort of discovered</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">this land of people that didn&#39;t fit what</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">she&#39;d been told the enemy looked like</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">and then basically burned the bridge i</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s metaphorical but almost literally</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">yeah burned the bridge so she couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.240" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">get back there</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">her original the original missive on</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">twitter you know and it&#39;s a ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">platform but</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">um seemed to suggest a curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">yeah a super an actual genuine surprise</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">and an openness because</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">she had presumably been in one of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">when one of these silos</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">and really truly believed the you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">the headlines from wapo and the guardian</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">and the new york times and everything</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">that if</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:11.520" style="s2">you oppose critical race theory you are</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:13.920" style="s2">a white supremacist</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.520" end="00:44:15.119" style="s2">those are the same thing and no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.920" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.119" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">yeah it reminds me actually of the young</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">woman</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve described her situation before who</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">wanted to who sought me out as i left</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:32.319" style="s2">the uh meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">nearly violent now quite famous meeting</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.319" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">at the top of the library building</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">at evergreen right 2017. sought me out</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">and basically her point when</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:43.920" style="s2">when other protesters attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">shut down the conversation her point was</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.920" end="00:44:47.680" style="s2">no i want to talk to him</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">and she actually says benjamin boyce</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">him and he doesn&#39;t sound like what</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.760" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">you&#39;re telling me he is and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">anyway they recaptured her the following</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">day well i&#39;m sure she was made to sing</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.720" end="00:46:08.000" style="s2">those aliens will also sleep they will</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.280" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">sleep</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.000" end="00:46:12.720" style="s2">but i believe they will depart from our</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">perspective with respect to whether</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.720" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">there&#39;s always room for pie</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">ah yeah exactly having nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">with sleep at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">right or pi in the sense that we will</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">agree on it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">right in any case we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">a remarkable situation surrounding the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.079" style="s2">president having contracted covet and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">want to talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.079" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">what this actually implies but i also</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:40.079" style="s2">feel an obligation to be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:42.960" style="s2">careful in a way that i think is almost</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.079" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">not even possible okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.960" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">the problem is because</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:50.560" style="s2">this issue was so thoroughly politicized</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">and frankly it was thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.560" end="00:46:56.800" style="s2">politicized on both sides but i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">trump was more political about kovid</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.800" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">it is very hard to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">the shakespearean</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">narrative that is unfolding or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s biblical but</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">the fact of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.839" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">trump having contracted kovid after</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">uh botched the initial</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">reaction to it downplayed its</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">seriousness all of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">it feels like karma it feels like come</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:30.319" style="s2">too many let&#39;s put it this way that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:33.359" style="s2">interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.319" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">it exists and it can&#39;t be avoided</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.359" end="00:47:37.839" style="s2">the problem is there is and i want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">avoid it because at the moment you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.839" end="00:47:41.359" style="s2">got the issue of a human being who has</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">contracted a disease</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.359" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">and gloating over that is unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">but you also have the following thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">commander-in-chief</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">this is now a fact of history and it</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">matters it matters to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">all of our well-being what&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:48:01.200" style="s2">fact that the commander-in-chief</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:03.200" style="s2">now has this disease which we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.200" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">learning a ton about but are still</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.200" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">new to um that it plays into this</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">election</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">in the final month in this way</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:15.040" style="s2">sets us up for tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.720" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">vulnerabilities and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.040" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">and we have to talk about them so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">fact that those things</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">intersect with this you know natural</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">tendency that many are succumbing to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:27.839" style="s2">to schadenfreude is a problem because as</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">you talk about what happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.839" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">and why you will tread in the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">territory that people are experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">glee so i want to avoid the glee</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">but i want to traverse this territory</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">because frankly</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.880" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">our interests as a nation depend on us</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">doing it well</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">so i want to point out a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">the nature of this disease and trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">parameters going into it</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:57.680" style="s2">spell a very serious situation for us</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.680" end="00:49:04.079" style="s2">almost no way in which he</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">simply has a low symptom case emerges</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.079" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">from it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.040" style="s2">quickly and we go back to the election</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">as it was unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.040" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">by trump&#39;s parameters i imagine you mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">what comes to mind immediately are these</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">three things his age</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.480" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">his sex and his weight yep his his size</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">you know so</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">you know by some measures he&#39;s obese he</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really look at but um you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s got he&#39;s got extra body weight</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">which we know</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:29.839" style="s2">is uh is a risk factor he&#39;s in his 70s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:30.559" style="s2">definitely a risk factor and he&#39;s male</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.839" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">which um</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.559" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it you have worse outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">in men than women</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">so all three of those are particular</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:39.440" style="s2">risk factors all three of those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.520" end="00:49:42.720" style="s2">particular risk factors and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">i think what we know is that just by age</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.720" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">and sex alone we are at double-digit</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:51.839" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">for death right that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.839" end="00:49:55.440" style="s2">a huge possibility but we&#39;re no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">think that&#39;s true you don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.440" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:49:58.880" style="s2">no i think the double digit if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:02.319" style="s2">just looking at age</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.880" end="00:50:04.319" style="s2">um starts in in the 80s 80s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.319" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">early 80s and it actually it&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.319" end="00:50:07.040" style="s2">like double or even more what it is in</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">and the and the increased risk of bad</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">outcomes from covid for men versus women</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">is a couple of percentage points it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">not uh and i don&#39;t remember it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">different across different studies but</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.240" style="s2">you know it might even be as much as</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.559" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">like 55 45 but</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.240" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think it&#39;s doubled at the very</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.839" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">least we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">a non-negligible possibility much</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">more likely is a severe</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">case and a severe case could mean all</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">kinds of things that interface with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">national interest</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">quite badly like he has to go</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">on a respirator which i believe would</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.240" style="s2">require him</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">to be sedated effectively it would put</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.240" end="00:50:50.559" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">in uh the territory where</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:54.000" style="s2">pence would be acting commander-in-chief</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.000" end="00:50:58.800" style="s2">and this i believe boris johnson was put</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">on a respirator when he contracted kovid</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.800" end="00:51:02.960" style="s2">two three four months ago yeah and um</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">that was you know that</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.960" end="00:51:06.480" style="s2">that was the biggest head of state that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">had contracted it</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.480" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">yet and he&#39;s quite a bit younger yep um</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">so and uh i was speaking to a brit this</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">morning</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">and the fact is it was a month</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">before he was back to</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">uh anything like normalcy</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">so my point would be given trump&#39;s age</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">and uh other factors</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve got one month to the election</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">right that is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">very likely to be completely eaten up</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">by whatever this is so</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">i guess i would say unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:49.839" style="s2">presidential debates can happen which</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">changes the electoral picture</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.839" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">we are already in the situation where we</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">are dealing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:52:00.079" style="s2">with transparently false medical</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">information or transparently misleading</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.079" end="00:52:03.359" style="s2">medical information</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">and of course we are i mean we would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.359" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">no matter who he was</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">actually no matter what party and</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:13.760" style="s2">how beloved or not the candidate was</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">uh the the advisors closest to him would</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.760" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">be putting</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">accurate and complete medical</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">information under</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">lockdown they just wouldn&#39;t be getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:24.240" style="s2">out i don&#39;t think um</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">i agree and i also think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.240" end="00:52:27.040" style="s2">something so</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">many people have talked about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.040" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">that trump was</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">on stage with biden now they were quite</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">far apart</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.559" style="s2">but this far apart business doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">the way we initially thought it did</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.559" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">so if people have been tracking this</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">there was initial doubt</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:45.920" style="s2">about aerosolized covid</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:48.000" style="s2">so this this is a little bit technical</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.920" end="00:52:51.119" style="s2">but initially it was thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.000" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">that the coveted particles were of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.119" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">that they were heavy and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.119" style="s2">breathed out they would tend to fall and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:53:00.079" style="s2">that&#39;s where the six</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.119" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">foot spacing idea came from what we now</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.079" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">understand is that this aerosolized</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">transmission happens where these</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">particles effectively hang in the air</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">indefinitely long they can see</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">it for hours it&#39;s possible you just</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">misspoke and i honestly haven&#39;t kept</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">track of the distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">airborne versus aerosols so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">that you just said both of those were</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">aerosolized can we just</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">come back i believe that airborne is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">larger particles that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">affected severely by gravity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">therefore short distance</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.640" style="s2">and so and aerosolize the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">particles which hang which hang for long</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.640" end="00:53:32.480" style="s2">periods of time and can therefore go</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">great distances so and they are less</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.480" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">likely to hang</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:36.559" style="s2">at least near the person who breathed</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:38.640" style="s2">them out</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.559" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">in a place with excellent ventilation</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.640" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">hence the value of being outside because</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:42.880" style="s2">no matter how good your ventilation is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:44.559" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.880" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s still an enclosed space and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.559" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">whatever was breathed out unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">already gone through you know the hvac</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">that has great scrubbers or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:52.720" style="s2">it&#39;s still in the room somewhere yep um</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.720" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a question i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">anybody in the public knows the answer</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">to this</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.839" style="s2">but there&#39;s a question i think so one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">the really important</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.839" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">stories buried somewhere in this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:11.760" style="s2">the fact that the white house could not</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:14.960" style="s2">effectively manage</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.760" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">trump&#39;s risk while he was playing games</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.960" end="00:54:19.280" style="s2">about being brazen and wearing a mask</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.440" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">not as frequently as you should</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.280" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">and all these things you would still</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">think with all of the availability of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">testing</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">and the availability and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">modulate</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">exactly how people meet behind closed</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">doors and all of these things that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">white house would have been in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:35.440" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">to protect the president while playing</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">with covet part of the problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">we just didn&#39;t know enough about how it</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">was transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the problem i think the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">other problem is they believed their own</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:48.240" style="s2">press</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">and that there was a culture of bravado</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.240" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">that surrounded covid that began to feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:54.000" style="s2">rewarding because they were more</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">liberated</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.000" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">to the extent that your enemies are</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:58.559" style="s2">wearing masks and you have your full</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">facial expression</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.559" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">and so there was this culture of um</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">callousness and carelessness that</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">ultimately i think does play into</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">why the president and the first lady</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">have gotten sick and why so many people</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.480" style="s2">in the white house seem to have gotten</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:18.640" style="s2">sick um</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.480" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">and in any case what will have happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.640" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">during the debate right the debate they</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">were spaced far apart</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">that&#39;s good the president and his party</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">were not wearing masks that&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">especially since multiple of them were</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:35.760" style="s2">sick you&#39;ve got multiple source points</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">yeah i i i need to fact check this but i</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.760" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">read</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:39.280" style="s2">that um actually no one in the trump</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:43.200" style="s2">family was</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:45.040" style="s2">in direct contradiction to uh the rules</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.200" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">except for melania apparently melania</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.040" end="00:55:48.160" style="s2">was for at least</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:49.760" style="s2">some some of that no she wasn&#39;t when she</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.160" end="00:55:50.880" style="s2">walked up on stage at the end yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">obviously but um</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.880" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">that&#39;s you know good for her if true</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:58.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">um but here&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.000" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">if they thought about covet as a serious</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">possibility in setting up that debate</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">then they could have managed air flow to</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">reduce the chances to near zero yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:12.880" style="s2">i bet they didn&#39;t yeah right i bet they</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:15.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t because i bet</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.880" end="00:56:16.960" style="s2">other competing concerns like air noise</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.200" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">over microphones and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.960" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">would have dominated and they would have</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">they&#39;re far apart good enough they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">have covid we do a lot of testing</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">whatever they would have thought so</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">maybe we find out the answer maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">don&#39;t but the question has been raised</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:32.559" style="s2">by many people</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">as to whether or not um biden might have</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">been exposed</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.799" style="s2">right and you know yes they were far</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.000" end="00:56:40.160" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.799" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">they were also uh vigorously</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.160" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">challenging each other vocally which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:46.559" style="s2">sometimes looking at each other doing so</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">right and that you know that even if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.559" end="00:56:50.559" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">about uh airborne only and six that you</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.559" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">know that six foot</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">thing is is a poor approximation</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">under all circumstances really because</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:01.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t account for um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">for everything yeah um it&#39;s an average</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.200" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">and it only works if you&#39;re talking kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:05.839" style="s2">of quietly</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:07.520" style="s2">right right and it may even actually be</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.839" end="00:57:09.520" style="s2">more stackier if you&#39;re just breathing</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.520" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">so as soon as you&#39;re talking loudly or</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.520" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">certainly if you&#39;re singing or shouting</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">um those droplets are going to be going</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">a lot farther right and they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.880" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">certainly in each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">they weren&#39;t literally in each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">faces but they were</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:22.720" style="s2">as close as they could have gotten while</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">staying behind their lecterns</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.720" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">yeah and you know biden is notably</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">frail and so what what we have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">talking about on</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s got two of the three risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:33.680" style="s2">factors that trump does um he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.680" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">overweight i don&#39;t think right i think</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">physically more frail yeah so that that</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">puts some weight so probably</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s similar um</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:50.480" style="s2">and so anyway the uh the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">exists but now that trump has</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.480" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">i think been forced to admit covet</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">because it would have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.799" style="s2">difficult you know i i i&#39;ve heard people</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">say that maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.799" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">phony i think it can&#39;t be i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">it plays positively for trump so i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:04.640" style="s2">that something that had to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.640" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">but i mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a hypothesis of</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.400" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">course that&#39;s a hypothesis on the table</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">and you know it occurred i think it</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">occurred to everyone right like it</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">has i think most of us who are paying</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">attention don&#39;t trust either of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">parties to be honest with us about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.400" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">okay who&#39;s how how is which party going</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:22.880" style="s2">to play this to a win</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">right right but the question is let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.880" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">biden came down with kobet we now know</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.640" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">he&#39;s been in the room in the last week</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">with a bunch of people who&#39;ve had it</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">within you know just a little more than</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">48 hours of someone</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">who you know 48 plus hours later</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">uh tested positive right so</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:43.359" style="s2">there is a question about him coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">down with it if</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.359" end="00:58:48.480" style="s2">trump is sidelined from public</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">appearances i.e debates</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">would the biden camp acknowledge it</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">if it happened i don&#39;t think we know but</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:58:57.359" style="s2">i must tell you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:58.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t trust either of these camps to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.359" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">be straight with us</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.480" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">and the question is you know let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">adults about this</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">the amount that is at stake in an</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">american presidential election</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">is trillions of dollars right that means</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:15.520" style="s2">that that&#39;s the game being played people</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:17.760" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.520" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">jockeying for position relative to that</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.760" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">massive value that gets</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">uh controlled in in these</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">uh contests have a huge incentive</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:31.040" style="s2">to do whatever makes it most likely that</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.359" end="00:59:32.240" style="s2">they will have the influence to pedal</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.040" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">and the other side won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.240" end="00:59:39.359" style="s2">yeah so in any case the</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what would happen uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.359" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">we&#39;re biden to get covey but more</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:42.720" style="s2">importantly the thing i really want to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.040" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.720" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">is in light of the symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:53.839" style="s2">that show up with many cases of covid</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">and in particular these long-haul cases</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.839" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">of covid</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">right people have brain fog that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">goes on for months some people have</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">things that recur</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">on them monthly that has implications</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">for the commander-in-chief</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:12.559" style="s2">in other words i think we have to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:16.960" style="s2">talking about the question</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.559" end="01:00:20.799" style="s2">about whether or not a is he 74</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.960" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">the president yeah sounds about right 74</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.799" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">year old</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">man who has coveted in october</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:32.480" style="s2">right is in a position going forward</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:34.640" style="s2">will we even know if he is in a position</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.480" end="01:00:36.480" style="s2">right will his doctors know i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.640" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">think they will know but even if they</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.480" end="01:00:39.200" style="s2">knew</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">would we know what the implication was</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.200" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">of this diagnosis going forward this</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">disease is so</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:46.240" style="s2">eclectic with respect to the tissues</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">that it affects</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.240" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">it is so clearly having cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">for people and we don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">long-term prospects are for these long</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:58.960" style="s2">haulers of which there are many</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">and the fact is even in our circle i</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.960" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">know people who have long haul problems</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:07.200" style="s2">with covid so and you know young people</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">yeah so anyway we have a predicament</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">where we are now</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">and you know americans have this bad</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">tendency to see</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">everything as the sort of internal to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:18.079" style="s2">america discussion</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">and to forget the international context</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.079" end="01:01:22.839" style="s2">where we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">um antagonists around the globe</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.839" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">who you know look at the question of how</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:30.480" style="s2">fit our commander-in-chief is likely to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">be at any given moment</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.480" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">and presumably make strategic decisions</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">based on that right</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">so anyway i i don&#39;t know how to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">this conversation well but i do have the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:40.240" style="s2">feeling that we are not having the</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">proper conversation which is</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:47.359" style="s2">a [ __ ] the goddamn duopoly for giving us</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">two fragile candidates at an</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.359" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">era where you have covid circulating</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">peril that demands a commander-in-chief</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">who can</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:02.160" style="s2">fire it up at a moment&#39;s notice and make</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">good decisions where we cannot have</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.160" end="01:02:06.559" style="s2">you know people randomly sidelined and</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:08.160" style="s2">you know some sort of theater going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.559" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">where we don&#39;t know how sick they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.160" end="01:02:11.520" style="s2">and what condition they&#39;re in today and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">you know the garbage today with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.520" end="01:02:14.799" style="s2">doctors</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">playing games around well he&#39;s not on</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.799" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">oxygen</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:20.799" style="s2">now right not on oxygen now</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">right was he ever on it well he&#39;s not on</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.799" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">it now um</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not like an answer to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">question yeah but i mean i&#39;m sure the</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">doctors have been told what they are and</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:31.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t allowed to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s we can&#39;t we shouldn&#39;t blame</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.839" end="01:02:39.280" style="s2">them i expect um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:41.280" style="s2">you know at some level i&#39;m i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.280" end="01:02:42.640" style="s2">lowering my threshold of tolerance</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.280" end="01:02:44.799" style="s2">because the fact is</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.640" end="01:02:46.319" style="s2">yes um this isn&#39;t this is bigger than</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.799" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">any individual</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.319" end="01:02:50.079" style="s2">right this is bigger than the election</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">this is about the republic and it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.079" end="01:02:53.039" style="s2">these processes in which everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">policing</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:56.079" style="s2">you know their own well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">adhering to rules that</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.079" end="01:02:59.760" style="s2">you know keep them in positions of power</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">that has put the republic in such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.760" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:05.760" style="s2">position and so my sense is actually um</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">you have an obligation to tell us the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.760" end="01:03:08.640" style="s2">truth because this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">you know this isn&#39;t about president</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.640" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">trump this is about the republic and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">whether or not it has a</p>

<p begin="01:05:25.039" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">problem is it has actual material costs</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:31.599" style="s2">people are</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:32.319" style="s2">dying because i mean look if you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.599" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.319" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">the dark horse podcast since we began</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">our live streams which centered</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">at in the early phase around covid quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">heavily</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">you know that we&#39;ve been building a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:46.039" style="s2">model you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">our scientific expertise is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.039" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">epidemiological</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:53.520" style="s2">uh you know in particular but that</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:54.720" style="s2">we were able to track a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.520" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">that were</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.720" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">coming into uh our comprehension</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">about what does and does not work you</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">know how people do and do not contract</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:06.400" style="s2">it initially we were much more concerned</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">about fomites that is to say viruses</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.400" end="01:06:10.240" style="s2">you pick up from touching things now we</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">know it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.240" end="01:06:15.200" style="s2">airborne and aerosolized right and that</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">these two things are factors</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">you need to update your model for that</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:21.760" style="s2">we know</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">that you know opening windows</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.760" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">has an effect that effectively the</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">volume of the room you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">matters a lot and therefore opening</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">windows effectively increases the volume</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:34.480" style="s2">of the room that the older you are</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">the you know lower the threshold at</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.480" end="01:06:39.200" style="s2">which you&#39;ll be infected</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.839" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">so the point is there&#39;s like a dozen</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.200" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">pieces of useful information that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">upgrade your model of how not to get</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:47.839" style="s2">sick and how not to get others sick</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:48.720" style="s2">and we are still playing with this</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.839" end="01:06:52.559" style="s2">garbagey</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.720" end="01:06:55.680" style="s2">political description of the virus</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.559" end="01:06:57.119" style="s2">that&#39;s really more about scolding people</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.680" end="01:06:58.799" style="s2">you&#39;re not wearing a mask you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.119" end="01:07:00.160" style="s2">them no i&#39;m outside</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.799" end="01:07:02.079" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s scolding people and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.160" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">except it&#39;s it&#39;s making people more</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.079" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">tribal</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">as they walk around and look at each</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:07.440" style="s2">other on the streets then the number of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.559" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.440" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">that i have gotten side eye from people</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:13.920" style="s2">walking around</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">outside from a distance you know 20 30</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">when i&#39;m not wearing a mask and they are</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:19.520" style="s2">and you know it could be anything but</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.000" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t usually happen to me</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.520" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">right like it&#39;s i don&#39;t i don&#39;t get a</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.599" end="01:07:26.480" style="s2">lot of nasty looks normally</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">and in the last two weeks four weeks six</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.480" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">weeks as</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">increasingly the messaging around</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">wear masks outside uh if you care about</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">yourself and others</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.880" end="01:07:38.400" style="s2">and oh oh by the way only wear masks</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">inside if you really can&#39;t keep yourself</p>

<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s [ __ ] and it&#39;s confusing</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.960" end="01:07:44.559" style="s2">people and it&#39;s making people</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">less kind and less generous and less</p>

<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:51.200" style="s2">and you know at the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.480" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">there was a proper epidemiological</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.200" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">conversation happening in public which</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">we described as a relief because we&#39;ve</p>
