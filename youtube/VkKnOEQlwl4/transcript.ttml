<p begin="00:00:06.080" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">welcome to the sense-making series so a</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.150" end="00:00:13.559" style="s2">few days ago a friend of mine asked me</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:16.529" style="s2">what I thought was going on and I told</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.559" end="00:00:18.810" style="s2">him that the pandemic was kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.529" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">an altered state and it had just acted</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.810" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">as a catalyst for a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:24.619" style="s2">were already there like the psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:27.930" style="s2">Stan Grof describes psychedelics as</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.619" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">effectively nonspecific amplifiers they</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.930" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">just magnify what&#39;s already there so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">think what&#39;s happened with the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:35.309" style="s2">is that it&#39;s acted as a catalyst for all</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">of the things that are under the surface</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.309" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">all of the fault lines and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">of truth is right at the center the</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:45.300" style="s2">collapse of institutional Authority the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">lack of a replacement and how we make</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.300" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">sense of the world together and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">the things that rebel wisdom has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:53.010" style="s2">talking about for the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">years in particular the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">crisis how do we know what&#39;s true how</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">can we discuss what&#39;s true what can be</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">talked about what can&#39;t be talked about</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">and how can we have conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">move us into fresh territory so with</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:08.939" style="s2">sense making it&#39;s all of these questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">of how is information weaponized on all</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.939" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">sides what are the psychological issues</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.400" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">what are the ideological issues so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:17.790" style="s2">going to unpack all of that over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">next few weeks and I&#39;ve said before it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.790" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">feels like we&#39;re in some interregnum</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">period between two worlds the trust in</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">the old system broadcast media academia</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:28.979" style="s2">and all these other ways of finding</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">truth is collapsing under the onslaught</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.979" end="00:01:34.860" style="s2">mostly of decentralized networked media</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have a networked solution</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:38.549" style="s2">to the problem of truth and this feels</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">like a really really dangerous place to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.549" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">be we&#39;ve lost one structure and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.460" style="s2">this kind of no-man&#39;s land between</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">before we get to another stable</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.460" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">structure and central to this has to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:51.659" style="s2">social media the influence of big tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">but also what is done to us as people</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.659" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">where communication starts being</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">performative where everything is</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">happening in public I&#39;m going to play a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">short clip from Jonathan Hite now from</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:06.000" style="s2">the Sam Harris podcast so I began to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">feel around 2014-2015 that something was</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.000" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">deeply wrong like like something has</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">changed about the universe suppose that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">suppose that God one day</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.670" style="s2">I just doubled the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:20.730" style="s2">constant so you know in our universe</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.670" end="00:02:22.050" style="s2">there&#39;s like 25 physical constants and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.730" end="00:02:23.730" style="s2">if God just said one day let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.050" end="00:02:25.830" style="s2">double the gravitational constant just</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.730" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">for fun like everything would go totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.830" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">haywire in the physical world and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:31.410" style="s2">know planets would move in their orbits</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">and planes would come out of the sky and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.410" end="00:02:36.270" style="s2">it would just be you know bizarre and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:38.640" style="s2">disastrous and I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.270" end="00:02:40.830" style="s2">happened is basically that but in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.640" end="00:02:43.019" style="s2">social world it&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.830" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">connectivity its connectivity in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.019" end="00:02:47.819" style="s2">we are communicating not privately but</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:50.850" style="s2">in front of an audience and the audience</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.819" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">rates the communication so this I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.850" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">is what social media has done to us on</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">the subject of the big tech platforms</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:02:59.459" style="s2">later in the series we&#39;re going to hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">from Tristan Harris sometimes called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.459" end="00:03:04.200" style="s2">conscience of Silicon Valley and Carl</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:06.209" style="s2">Miller of the Center for the analysis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.200" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">social media when you kind of sit down</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.209" end="00:03:09.989" style="s2">and you talk to people that have</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">actually done in from influence</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.989" end="00:03:14.280" style="s2">operations in information warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:18.030" style="s2">the first thing that you learn from them</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">is that they barely ever try to convince</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.030" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">you of something that you didn&#39;t already</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">think was true about the world it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:28.380" style="s2">much much easier to influence you and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">change your behavior on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.380" end="00:03:31.890" style="s2">giving you from information which</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.170" style="s2">already confirms what you think is true</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.890" end="00:03:35.519" style="s2">about the world make you even anger</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.170" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">about the things that you think are true</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:39.150" style="s2">about the world and then direct what</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:41.250" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do about with all that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.150" end="00:03:43.620" style="s2">anger into one direction or another and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.250" end="00:03:46.109" style="s2">and they will tell you there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.620" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">absolutely no and point really liked</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.109" end="00:03:51.299" style="s2">people most of the time because you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.239" end="00:03:53.160" style="s2">build an extremely distorted picture the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.299" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">world simply through the judicious</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.160" end="00:03:57.269" style="s2">selection of some facts over another so</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:58.920" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna start this series by going</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.269" end="00:04:01.140" style="s2">back to some things that we&#39;ve covered</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.920" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">in the past on rebel wisdom because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.140" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">issues that that brought up are now even</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:07.140" style="s2">more pressing than they were before</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:09.150" style="s2">in particular the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.140" end="00:04:10.980" style="s2">phenomenon so we did quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.150" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">pieces around the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.980" end="00:04:15.870" style="s2">concept at around the time of the first</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">big rebel wisdom piece glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.870" end="00:04:19.169" style="s2">matrix so I&#39;m gonna play another quick</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:20.930" style="s2">clip introducing what the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.169" end="00:04:23.780" style="s2">dark web is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.930" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">- that tall dark web was first named by</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.780" end="00:04:28.580" style="s2">the mathematician and physicist Eric</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:37.220" style="s2">join together an unlikely group of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:39.620" style="s2">intellectuals and alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.220" end="00:04:41.930" style="s2">personalities all the way from</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.620" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">psychologist Jordan Peterson to</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:46.850" style="s2">podcaster and martial arts commentator</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">Joe Rogan figures from across the</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.850" end="00:04:52.250" style="s2">political spectrum but all supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:55.370" style="s2">united by their willingness to have open</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.250" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">and difficult conversations the name</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.370" end="00:05:01.070" style="s2">stuck interest in the phenomenon quickly</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:04.729" style="s2">spread far and wide with many thousands</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.070" end="00:05:09.110" style="s2">joining the conversation online welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.729" end="00:05:11.630" style="s2">by some ridiculed by others and even</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.110" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">questioned by some in the group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.630" end="00:05:18.949" style="s2">like a herd of cats right because so</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:21.259" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought about well what what what</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.949" end="00:05:23.300" style="s2">unites us to the degree that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.259" end="00:05:25.310" style="s2">us because that&#39;s not so self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.300" end="00:05:27.680" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of enough so that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.310" end="00:05:30.380" style="s2">name emerged and it&#39;s stuck</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.680" end="00:05:32.570" style="s2">so so there&#39;s something in common</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.380" end="00:05:35.300" style="s2">because otherwise the name wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.570" end="00:05:37.970" style="s2">stuck right you can&#39;t name nothing it</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.300" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so what is the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.970" end="00:05:45.050" style="s2">darkweb people in the group tend to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:47.900" style="s2">reject orthodoxy tend to reject ideology</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.050" end="00:05:51.139" style="s2">tend to be interested in first</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.900" end="00:05:54.919" style="s2">principles thinking meaning that if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.139" end="00:05:56.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t take something on faith you</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.919" end="00:05:57.860" style="s2">need a group of people who are willing</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.300" end="00:06:00.889" style="s2">to say hey you know you made a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.860" end="00:06:02.590" style="s2">point I changed my mind and I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.889" end="00:06:06.860" style="s2">something that I didn&#39;t think about and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.590" end="00:06:10.190" style="s2">that kind of integrity in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.860" end="00:06:12.259" style="s2">is what characterizes a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:06:14.750" end="00:06:18.650" style="s2">may not even agree as to what the facts</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.139" end="00:07:48.770" style="s2">was that it was right-wing and</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">were in some sort of society-wide Ponzi</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:25.189" style="s2">scheme since the late 60s early 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:26.029" style="s2">that there was no way to continue to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.189" end="00:12:29.720" style="s2">grow our way out</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:41.439" style="s2">all times and that&#39;s a very terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.449" end="00:12:44.059" style="s2">thought to have we have effectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.439" end="00:12:46.879" style="s2">entered a period in which we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.059" end="00:12:50.269" style="s2">trust our experts and I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.879" end="00:12:53.449" style="s2">began as a desire to contribute it to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.269" end="00:12:56.660" style="s2">real work ended with an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.449" end="00:12:58.910" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got two generations of</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.910" end="00:13:02.509" style="s2">and that we cannot wake up from this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.649" end="00:13:04.879" style="s2">crazy fever dream that we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.509" end="00:13:07.369" style="s2">because we can&#39;t figure out who we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.879" end="00:13:09.139" style="s2">still trust the doctors are compromised</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.369" end="00:13:10.490" style="s2">that professors are compromised the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.139" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">journalists are compromised the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.490" end="00:13:15.619" style="s2">politicians are compromised about the</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.619" end="00:13:21.470" style="s2">are people with an independent source of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.829" end="00:13:24.439" style="s2">sustenance individuals and very small</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.470" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">groups are about the only thing that is</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.869" end="00:13:33.649" style="s2">is that the individuals have to save the</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.879" end="00:13:52.129" style="s2">collapse I think what we need is we need</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.189" end="00:13:57.019" style="s2">to realize that the diversity of ideas</p>

<p begin="00:14:28.220" end="00:14:32.749" style="s2">probably has the best explanation which</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.379" end="00:14:36.079" style="s2">is that when you&#39;re actually dependent</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.749" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">on labor for your voter base labour has</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.079" end="00:14:40.610" style="s2">economic issues so this is the great</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:43.069" style="s2">search for something cheaper than labor</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.610" end="00:14:44.689" style="s2">and identity turns out to be much</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.069" end="00:14:47.089" style="s2">cheaper than labor if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.689" end="00:14:50.059" style="s2">somebody to vote for you</p>

<p begin="00:14:50.059" end="00:14:54.740" style="s2">their security and their retirement but</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.949" end="00:14:58.459" style="s2">you&#39;re going to celebrate the fact you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.740" end="00:15:02.119" style="s2">know that they came from Laos that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.459" end="00:15:04.459" style="s2">bad deal nothing against the Laotians</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.119" end="00:15:07.369" style="s2">but for God&#39;s sake stand up for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.459" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">as a worker before you you know stand up</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.369" end="00:15:11.689" style="s2">for yourself as somebody who needs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.620" end="00:15:13.250" style="s2">see Southeast Asia celebrated on the</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.250" end="00:15:19.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not that exciting demand more from</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.790" end="00:15:21.910" style="s2">from your representatives this is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.400" end="00:15:24.380" style="s2">great search for the cheapest possible</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.380" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">think it&#39;s happening I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:33.140" style="s2">because the traditional Democratic voter</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:34.420" style="s2">base was too expensive they wanted real</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:36.230" style="s2">change they wanted to participate</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.420" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">economically they wanted to participate</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">said is there isn&#39;t there anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.900" end="00:15:46.550" style="s2">cheaper than labour and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:48.530" style="s2">found something I&#39;m gonna link to all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.550" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">these films in the show notes below so</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.530" end="00:15:52.880" style="s2">Bret Weinstein and his wife Heather hi</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:55.520" style="s2">Inge were famously involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.880" end="00:15:58.310" style="s2">Evergreen uprising and had to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.520" end="00:16:01.010" style="s2">College in 2017 really worth watching</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.310" end="00:16:07.070" style="s2">Mike Nana&#39;s films looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.010" end="00:16:09.770" style="s2">happened then what&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.070" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">about Heather and Bret&#39;s situation given</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.770" end="00:16:14.000" style="s2">that Evergreen was definitely one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:15.980" style="s2">most progressive colleges in the country</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:18.280" style="s2">is that they were teaching evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.980" end="00:16:20.600" style="s2">biology the reality of sex differences</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.280" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">some of the topics that are hardest to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.600" end="00:16:24.650" style="s2">talk about at the moment in progressive</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.730" end="00:16:26.839" style="s2">circles and they were talking about them</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.650" end="00:16:28.280" style="s2">for a decade before the uprising</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.839" end="00:16:30.440" style="s2">happened and they were forced to leave</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.280" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">Evergreen so I wanted to know how they</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.440" end="00:16:34.280" style="s2">managed that and what lessons they had</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:36.800" style="s2">for talking about some of these very</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.280" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">difficult topics the thing that the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.800" end="00:16:41.660" style="s2">has done is it has bootstrapped that</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:44.540" style="s2">kind of safety on topics where people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.660" end="00:16:47.900" style="s2">experience in general a profound lack of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.540" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">safety so I think the reason that there</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.900" end="00:16:54.620" style="s2">has been such a focus on the IDW is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">people through the internet can watch</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.620" end="00:17:01.070" style="s2">others saying things the very nuance of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:04.790" style="s2">which would cause them to blow up if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.070" end="00:17:07.400" style="s2">said them you know in a speech on a</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.790" end="00:17:09.079" style="s2">university campus let&#39;s say and watching</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.400" end="00:17:10.730" style="s2">people have those discussions and</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.079" end="00:17:14.449" style="s2">respond to each other in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.730" end="00:17:19.730" style="s2">disagreement and not have catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.449" end="00:17:21.260" style="s2">rein in on them is I think heartening in</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.730" end="00:17:23.060" style="s2">fact I know that that&#39;s the reaction</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.260" end="00:17:26.270" style="s2">because I hear a lot from individuals</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.060" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">who tell me what they see and they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.270" end="00:17:31.460" style="s2">cheering for the the simple</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.480" end="00:17:34.670" style="s2">demonstration that these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.460" end="00:17:37.340" style="s2">are still possible and if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.670" end="00:17:39.980" style="s2">distill down what say three or four</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.340" end="00:17:43.550" style="s2">principles of having a generative</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.980" end="00:17:47.180" style="s2">conversation in good faith ah what would</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.550" end="00:17:49.400" style="s2">they be what conditions allow for that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.180" end="00:17:52.790" style="s2">so how do you know you&#39;re having one</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.400" end="00:17:53.990" style="s2">maybe like what are what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.790" end="00:17:55.850" style="s2">are the signals that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.990" end="00:17:57.230" style="s2">doing it right but you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.850" end="00:18:00.920" style="s2">having a good conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.230" end="00:18:03.770" style="s2">no wrote apologies apologies for actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.920" end="00:18:05.450" style="s2">wrongs but no wrote apologies do not</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.450" end="00:18:13.880" style="s2">actually do and if you see sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">culture of rote apology in a big</p>

<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:19.670" style="s2">there&#39;s probably fear right underneath</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.520" end="00:18:22.430" style="s2">the surface similarly I would say look</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.670" end="00:18:25.130" style="s2">for laughter look for humor look look</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.430" end="00:18:26.510" style="s2">for and not just you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.130" end="00:18:31.790" style="s2">everyone can tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.510" end="00:18:34.430" style="s2">a nervous laughter and and regular from</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.790" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">the gut laughter in which things even</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:40.220" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s often when things get funny</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.230" end="00:18:41.780" style="s2">when a conversation that was very</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.220" end="00:18:43.640" style="s2">serious or very technical suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.780" end="00:18:45.680" style="s2">erupts and laughter if that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.640" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">there&#39;s probably not fear right beneath</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.680" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">the surface and and obviously laughter</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:53.630" style="s2">is also a way that people people bond as</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:55.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll explain a bit more in my talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.630" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">tomorrow there was always a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.160" end="00:18:59.270" style="s2">unclarity with the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">something that Eric Weinstein who came</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.270" end="00:19:04.970" style="s2">up with the term will say was deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:07.340" style="s2">was it a set of people was it a set of</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.669" end="00:30:53.150" style="s2">almost all those are gonna be wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.039" end="00:30:53.150" style="s2">you have to actually step into a pretty</p>

<p begin="00:32:03.539" end="00:32:11.520" style="s2">and so I think many of the people that</p>
