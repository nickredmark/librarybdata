<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">I met with a we had the invitation from</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">Burning Man to come together and gather</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:50.810" style="s2">and convene at Esalen to see how we</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">could broaden the power and use the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.810" end="00:03:55.590" style="s2">philosophy and principles of Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">beyond the event to have a positive</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.590" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">impact in the world and after the event</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:03.900" style="s2">we wanted to keep momentum and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:05.700" style="s2">figure out how we could use the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.900" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">knowledge and the network of Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.700" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">to have a positive impact and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:14.070" style="s2">catalyzed by what is happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">in our world we said you know more than</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.070" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">ever we have trapped ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:20.720" style="s2">system that is about to destroy us and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">and how can we get out of it and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.720" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a question where we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">brainstorming thinking about like how</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">can we do this and obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:34.290" style="s2">something you know we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:37.530" style="s2">together and and and we use this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.290" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">playful gamification of Mario as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.530" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">background because you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:45.270" style="s2">we need to have that positive light and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:47.520" style="s2">positive feel in the development of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.270" end="00:04:49.380" style="s2">solutions and in the gatherings we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.520" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">it needs to be positive needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.380" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">positive change but it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.830" end="00:04:59.460" style="s2">serious time where we need to radically</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:05:02.670" style="s2">redirect the course of humanity and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.460" end="00:05:05.580" style="s2">that is the the idea behind the radical</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.670" end="00:05:10.500" style="s2">catalyst Club is to bring people</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.580" end="00:05:13.920" style="s2">together in in this case virtually to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.500" end="00:05:15.990" style="s2">come up with ideas of what is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.920" end="00:05:18.030" style="s2">direction and what are the tools and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.990" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">what do we need what and there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.030" end="00:05:24.150" style="s2">of people and and and Jordan Hall will</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:25.890" style="s2">talk about that like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.150" end="00:05:28.290" style="s2">smart people there&#39;s a lot of smart</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.890" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">initiatives happening but we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.290" end="00:05:33.090" style="s2">bring that together and and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:35.310" style="s2">what focus we want and this is the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.090" end="00:05:39.000" style="s2">where we are forced to slow down and do</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.310" end="00:05:41.070" style="s2">that and so we defined the mission where</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:43.350" style="s2">we said we want to co-create places</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.070" end="00:05:46.170" style="s2">where people can be to change they wish</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.350" end="00:05:48.870" style="s2">to see it in the world and of course a</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.170" end="00:05:51.210" style="s2">play on Gandhi but co-creation is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.870" end="00:05:53.640" style="s2">really really important aspect and and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.210" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">will keep some pace because we need time</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.640" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">for to listen to Jordan and then to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:06:01.410" style="s2">time to interactively talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">topic and how we can make a change and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.410" end="00:06:07.710" style="s2">plant seeds as I said this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">opening week of the radical catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.710" end="00:06:13.260" style="s2">Club and it&#39;s a look at it like a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">bit like a nightclub or a cabaret club</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.260" end="00:06:18.300" style="s2">or a club where we have different</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:21.510" style="s2">programming&#39;s going on and tonight is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.300" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">moment where we have a speaker a guest</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:29.010" style="s2">speaker and talk around that tomorrow is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">a different type of a of an oven club</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.010" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">night so to say where we are more in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.150" style="s2">work session and share our projects and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:38.790" style="s2">talk around those projects with each</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.150" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">other and share what we need very</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.790" end="00:06:42.030" style="s2">practical what do we each need what do</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.030" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">give and what are we committed to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:52.410" style="s2">within this this club community and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:55.530" style="s2">obviously this rat cat club as a playful</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.410" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">word of radical catalyst club we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.530" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">everybody we need all the smart cats all</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:04.740" style="s2">the thinkers scientists artists to come</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:07.350" style="s2">together and that&#39;s the principle today</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.740" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">we have Jordan Hall turning crisis into</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.350" end="00:07:13.020" style="s2">an opportunity and at the end of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:16.830" style="s2">session we&#39;ll talk a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">about tomorrow Julian I&#39;ve submitted</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:24.870" style="s2">Esalen and it was a conference on how</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:27.480" style="s2">can we apply the massive amount of joy</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.870" end="00:07:28.710" style="s2">and bliss and self-organizing change it</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.480" end="00:07:31.010" style="s2">happens at Burning Man and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.710" end="00:07:33.210" style="s2">apply that to the rest of the world or</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.010" end="00:07:35.100" style="s2">enable the rest of the world to actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.210" end="00:07:38.310" style="s2">live into that as much as they were</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.100" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">willing to to observe that and so my</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.310" end="00:07:42.330" style="s2">work has largely been full-time on</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:44.610" style="s2">working on building those systems and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.330" end="00:07:46.590" style="s2">that&#39;s how I met Bonnie and Bonnie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.610" end="00:07:52.110" style="s2">work has been about creating these</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.590" end="00:07:55.050" style="s2">self-organizing self open participatory</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.110" end="00:07:57.710" style="s2">ization systems as she calls it and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.050" end="00:08:01.460" style="s2">it&#39;s through Buckley that she introduced</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.710" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">Jordan Hall as a as an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.460" end="00:08:05.100" style="s2">presenter for tonight so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:07.050" style="s2">introduce Bonnie to introduce Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.100" end="00:08:12.210" style="s2">that&#39;ll be the last intro to an intro to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.050" end="00:08:14.970" style="s2">an intro yeah so introducing Jordan is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.210" end="00:08:22.530" style="s2">is a big job because there&#39;s too much to</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.970" end="00:08:25.530" style="s2">say so I you know people who know Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.530" end="00:08:27.330" style="s2">he&#39;s a brilliant systems thinker but he</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.530" end="00:08:30.090" style="s2">has this really unique coat approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.330" end="00:08:35.330" style="s2">called deep cold which gets at the key</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.090" end="00:08:39.030" style="s2">underlying dynamics of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.330" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">what I think is especially appreciate it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.030" end="00:08:44.160" style="s2">is that he doesn&#39;t do this for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">simple play of ideas but in order to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.160" end="00:08:47.490" style="s2">make sense of the world so we can make</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:52.800" style="s2">better choices and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.490" end="00:08:55.110" style="s2">resonates with everybody here so just</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.800" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">kind of a set up and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.110" end="00:09:02.210" style="s2">Jordan&#39;s really good speaking but just</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:06.150" style="s2">to set this up I was wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.210" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">Jordan to weave together three notions</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.150" end="00:09:12.420" style="s2">so the notions systemic fragility you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:15.540" style="s2">know at the system&#39;s level at an</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.420" end="00:09:18.210" style="s2">individual sovereignty so you know how</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.540" end="00:09:20.670" style="s2">does the individual sovereignty play</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.210" end="00:09:23.220" style="s2">into systemic fragility and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.670" end="00:09:27.080" style="s2">collective sense making can try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.220" end="00:09:31.380" style="s2">interweave those around and and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.080" end="00:09:34.920" style="s2">using the recent coronavirus situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.380" end="00:09:38.010" style="s2">that we&#39;re all dealing with yeah so how</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.920" end="00:09:40.740" style="s2">does the corona virus play out with</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.010" end="00:09:44.790" style="s2">systemic fragility individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.740" end="00:09:46.710" style="s2">sovereignty and collective sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.790" end="00:09:48.030" style="s2">I just want to explain to people what</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.710" end="00:09:49.770" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about by assistant</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.030" end="00:09:51.960" style="s2">facility by the way it&#39;s just the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.770" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">is that when one thing drags everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.960" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">else breaks with it with it and how do</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:01.740" style="s2">we create a decentralized system by</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">which that prevents that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.740" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">culture that the Bernie man called cures</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:08.010" style="s2">or actually kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">unconsciously creating is this how the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.010" end="00:10:12.300" style="s2">quickest stuff organized culture that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:18.750" style="s2">that is that&#39;s independent of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.300" end="00:10:20.250" style="s2">fragile system right so you see all</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.750" end="00:10:22.380" style="s2">right right now it&#39;s the shift to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.250" end="00:10:23.490" style="s2">notion of opportunity and then we&#39;ll and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.380" end="00:10:27.820" style="s2">then connect that to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.490" end="00:10:31.270" style="s2">individual sovereignty it can be very</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.820" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">to get out of a system thank systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.270" end="00:10:34.840" style="s2">dynamics have a characteristic in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">complexity science is called an</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.840" end="00:10:39.280" style="s2">attractor sort of like being in a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:41.620" style="s2">steep bowl and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.280" end="00:10:43.390" style="s2">ant trying to push a grape up the edge</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.620" end="00:10:45.250" style="s2">of a bowl that&#39;s a lot of push</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.390" end="00:10:47.740" style="s2">indecision let go it rolls down to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.250" end="00:10:50.290" style="s2">bottom a Sisyphean task of getting out</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.740" end="00:10:53.070" style="s2">of the system but what happens is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.290" end="00:10:55.570" style="s2">that as the system fragility increases</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.070" end="00:10:58.000" style="s2">there are moments like the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.570" end="00:10:59.950" style="s2">we&#39;re in where you actually get the bowl</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.000" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">gets less that&#39;s deep it gets shallower</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.950" end="00:11:03.610" style="s2">I mean the amount of energy necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:05.800" style="s2">move you out of that basis of attraction</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.610" end="00:11:07.480" style="s2">goes down and if you get a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:09.370" style="s2">effect by the way if you actually get</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.480" end="00:11:11.110" style="s2">you know many many systems have become</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.370" end="00:11:13.480" style="s2">fragile next to each other in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.110" end="00:11:14.770" style="s2">system is fragile then you get this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:17.590" style="s2">situation where small amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.770" end="00:11:18.850" style="s2">spillover hit subsystems those break</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.590" end="00:11:20.830" style="s2">they send spillover you get a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.850" end="00:11:23.140" style="s2">catastrophic cascade effect across the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.830" end="00:11:24.730" style="s2">entire thing and using the bowl metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.140" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">that&#39;s like the bowl going perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.730" end="00:11:28.930" style="s2">flat meaning that now the ball could</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">roll anywhere there&#39;s absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.930" end="00:11:32.320" style="s2">constraint so it can do otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">something like chaos various small</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.320" end="00:11:37.420" style="s2">amounts of energy can lead to very big</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:39.250" style="s2">changes now for folks like yourselves if</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.420" end="00:11:41.620" style="s2">you&#39;re actually thinking about change</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.250" end="00:11:43.720" style="s2">this means that you&#39;ve got a way of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.620" end="00:11:45.730" style="s2">looking at strategic operations if</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.720" end="00:11:48.280" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to push the ball up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.730" end="00:11:51.310" style="s2">edge of the of the bowl when the bowl is</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.280" end="00:11:52.450" style="s2">deep that&#39;s a lot of energy like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.310" end="00:11:55.240" style="s2">like trying to change the American</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.450" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">school system in 1985 good luck that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.240" end="00:11:59.350" style="s2">lot of energy lots of things are linked</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:01.030" style="s2">together and pulling it into a certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.350" end="00:12:03.850" style="s2">location you can work a lifetime and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.030" end="00:12:05.350" style="s2">only move it a little tiny bit but if</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.850" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">you hit at a moment when a moment that</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.350" end="00:12:09.820" style="s2">what the Greeks called Kairos a moment</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">where possibility has emerged and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.820" end="00:12:14.590" style="s2">actuality is wide open but the book with</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:16.390" style="s2">the field is flat well some sense you</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.590" end="00:12:18.520" style="s2">can&#39;t help but change things there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.390" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">way to avoid it and now change becomes</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.520" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2">not just but becomes very very easy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:24.250" style="s2">the question then becomes can you</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.850" end="00:12:26.080" style="s2">actually store the change in a preferred</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.250" end="00:12:28.510" style="s2">direction and that becomes the thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.080" end="00:12:30.610" style="s2">new things are always intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.510" end="00:12:33.160" style="s2">groups like we are only conscious we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.610" end="00:12:34.930" style="s2">were operating around the campfire use</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.160" end="00:12:36.610" style="s2">around the campfire like this particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.930" end="00:12:38.470" style="s2">gathering we actually able to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.610" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">a space of consciousness which is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.470" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">space where we collaborate design</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:43.900" style="s2">the kinds of things that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:45.730" style="s2">wanted them do together and we design</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.900" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">our culture around the campfire in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.730" end="00:12:49.720" style="s2">space of shared consciousness so what</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:52.540" style="s2">happens is is that if we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.720" end="00:12:54.310" style="s2">remove ourselves from the addictions and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.540" end="00:12:55.840" style="s2">distractions of the chaos of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.310" end="00:12:58.420" style="s2">breakdown of the formal systems and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.840" end="00:12:59.980" style="s2">settle into our individual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.420" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">to recognize the end of the day that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.980" end="00:13:05.530" style="s2">actually can and must always be</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:07.170" style="s2">responsible for our own choices we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.530" end="00:13:10.570" style="s2">gonna get to sense-making in a second</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.170" end="00:13:12.250" style="s2">then we can reconnect relearn the skills</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.570" end="00:13:14.880" style="s2">and skillfulness of supporting each</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.250" end="00:13:17.410" style="s2">other and collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.880" end="00:13:19.090" style="s2">from that position begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.410" end="00:13:21.520" style="s2">redesigning and co-creating the place</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.090" end="00:13:22.780" style="s2">that we&#39;d like to go in some sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.520" end="00:13:24.820" style="s2">pretty simple it&#39;s just practically</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.780" end="00:13:28.390" style="s2">difficult is this the way that ice</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.820" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">crystals form on a very still pond if</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.390" end="00:13:32.470" style="s2">you take a look at it very if you sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:35.350" style="s2">of do a stop-motion film of it you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.470" end="00:13:39.610" style="s2">see that they form in in clusters one</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.350" end="00:13:41.860" style="s2">little tiny location where the the water</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.610" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">has transformed from liquid to crystal</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.860" end="00:13:47.470" style="s2">and what a crystal does the way a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:50.670" style="s2">crystal grows is it actually changes the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.470" end="00:13:53.950" style="s2">probability of the water around it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.670" end="00:13:56.260" style="s2">turning into ice that&#39;s how a crystal</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.950" end="00:13:58.450" style="s2">grows so what happens is is that one</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.260" end="00:14:00.070" style="s2">person who has become capable of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.450" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">engaging in their own sovereignty with</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.070" end="00:14:05.980" style="s2">themselves and engaging in collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:07.720" style="s2">sense making becomes a crystal and when</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.980" end="00:14:10.600" style="s2">two people connect that crystal becomes</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.720" end="00:14:13.810" style="s2">stronger and it has more capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.600" end="00:14:15.520" style="s2">create influence to shift the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.810" end="00:14:17.560" style="s2">possibility space of the area around it</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.520" end="00:14:22.270" style="s2">and there&#39;s many many of these going on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.560" end="00:14:23.950" style="s2">like I&#39;ve never met well almost anybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.270" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">here I think I&#39;ve met Bonnie and Cori I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.950" end="00:14:27.280" style="s2">don&#39;t think anybody here I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:28.630" style="s2">met before so you guys are doing this</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.280" end="00:14:30.730" style="s2">right you&#39;re in your own little crystal</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.630" end="00:14:32.050" style="s2">and Bonnie ends up actually being one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.730" end="00:14:33.520" style="s2">these things that connects crystals and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.050" end="00:14:37.090" style="s2">I got a bunch of crystals I&#39;m touching</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.520" end="00:14:39.700" style="s2">and as the crystals grow together those</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.090" end="00:14:42.220" style="s2">connections become very strong as long</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.700" end="00:14:43.410" style="s2">as the binding becomes effective it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.220" end="00:14:46.270" style="s2">creates all kinds of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.410" end="00:14:47.710" style="s2">creativity in humans because your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.270" end="00:14:49.990" style="s2">is doing stuff that my tribes aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.710" end="00:14:51.160" style="s2">doing and that&#39;s perfect what we want my</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.990" end="00:14:52.330" style="s2">tribe might be working on problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.160" end="00:14:53.590" style="s2">domains that your tribe thinks for</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.330" end="00:14:55.060" style="s2">stupid</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.590" end="00:14:56.860" style="s2">because eventually if we figured</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.060" end="00:14:57.850" style="s2">something out then that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.860" end="00:14:59.530" style="s2">may be valuable do you see this a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.850" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">burning man all the time oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.530" end="00:15:03.130" style="s2">I remember going and seeing the list of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.040" style="s2">things that people are doing and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.130" end="00:15:07.960" style="s2">ranged from the was it the absurd the</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.110" end="00:21:27.410" style="s2">named uh Stefan Martin oh I worked with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.770" end="00:21:31.150" style="s2">him quite a bit about a year ago said to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.410" end="00:21:34.370" style="s2">me no movements no more movements and</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.150" end="00:21:35.960" style="s2">that comes to mind first and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.370" end="00:21:37.340" style="s2">the reason why I think what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.960" end="00:21:40.220" style="s2">meant by that is this notion that what a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.340" end="00:21:44.030" style="s2">movement does is it gets rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.220" end="00:21:45.740" style="s2">heterogeneity in the wholeness it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.030" end="00:21:47.720" style="s2">creates a new layer of bullshit that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.740" end="00:21:50.630" style="s2">gets everybody to lose their local</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.720" end="00:21:52.970" style="s2">perception and subordinate their choice</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.630" end="00:21:55.880" style="s2">making to some much narrower frame of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.970" end="00:21:57.410" style="s2">what reality is because the answer</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.880" end="00:21:58.490" style="s2">because as I was imagining that as</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.410" end="00:22:00.020" style="s2">you&#39;re asking the question is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.490" end="00:22:02.450" style="s2">just sort of okay what was my perception</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.020" end="00:22:04.190" style="s2">my perceptions is that that now when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.450" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">system enters into these states of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.190" end="00:22:08.929" style="s2">fragility the answer is the gaps are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">everywhere all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:13.910" style="s2">ants there&#39;s nothing nothing like one or</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:15.650" style="s2">two gaps although by hypothesis there</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.910" end="00:22:19.070" style="s2">are a number of very they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.650" end="00:22:21.110" style="s2">leverageable places but the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.070" end="00:22:23.150" style="s2">is to look close at hand look at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.110" end="00:22:25.429" style="s2">place where you can make the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.150" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">effective choices very narrow to where</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.429" end="00:22:29.090" style="s2">you are oftentimes it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:32.210" style="s2">things like relationships that are very</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:34.100" style="s2">close and then a little bit in the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.210" end="00:22:37.130" style="s2">that you&#39;re at and the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.100" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">though is that if the consciousness of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.130" end="00:22:40.160" style="s2">larger group of people all more or less</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:42.350" style="s2">are due</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.160" end="00:22:44.170" style="s2">that kind of thing and if we&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.350" end="00:22:46.460" style="s2">back back to Bernie man if I take like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.170" end="00:22:49.820" style="s2">stop-motion photography and I watch</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.460" end="00:22:51.710" style="s2">Burning Man well I don&#39;t see like one</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.820" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">guy saying okay everybody build that now</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.710" end="00:22:57.730" style="s2">and do this what I see is this like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">it almost looks like a natural system</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:01.270" style="s2">like the way that snow falls on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.890" style="s2">ground are just kind of emerges it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.270" end="00:23:04.720" style="s2">because every individual person in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.890" end="00:23:06.520" style="s2">relationship with their local context is</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.720" end="00:23:09.640" style="s2">beginning to sense what is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.520" end="00:23:10.870" style="s2">they can best at give give to what has</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.640" end="00:23:12.880" style="s2">happened and collaboratively in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.870" end="00:23:14.260" style="s2">context of the whole in some cases it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.880" end="00:23:17.410" style="s2">like okay I&#39;m gonna grab that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.260" end="00:23:18.760" style="s2">PVC pipe and carry it over here in some</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.410" end="00:23:20.049" style="s2">cases it means I&#39;m gonna grab this bike</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.760" end="00:23:21.970" style="s2">and move it over there alright and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.049" end="00:23:23.289" style="s2">there&#39;s that that notion of flowing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.970" end="00:23:25.620" style="s2">recognizing that we&#39;re actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.289" end="00:23:28.570" style="s2">and have to contemplate of holes as</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.620" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">holes that&#39;s the key now the keys we</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.570" end="00:23:31.690" style="s2">have to actually really be mindful but</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.010" end="00:23:34.870" style="s2">we&#39;re always in relationship as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.690" end="00:23:36.309" style="s2">and contemplate the whole as a whole and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.870" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">so in some sense we all have to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.309" end="00:23:41.590" style="s2">pick it up which is more or less us</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:43.000" style="s2">we&#39;re it to pick us up and each one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.590" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">us kind of nudging pieces I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.000" end="00:23:46.090" style="s2">carrying it ever so carefully we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:47.980" style="s2">kind of hold it and move it to a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.090" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">different location</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.980" end="00:23:53.710" style="s2">I mean Burnett works best when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:56.440" style="s2">not like it you don&#39;t have a schedule of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.710" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">events but you walk through and this not</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.440" end="00:24:00.190" style="s2">just that thing and it&#39;s this group and</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:01.870" style="s2">that group then it&#39;s another group it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.190" end="00:24:06.039" style="s2">decides to do something else and it just</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.870" end="00:24:07.090" style="s2">constantly emerges naturally and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.039" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">why they don&#39;t like being called a</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.090" end="00:24:10.360" style="s2">festival because the festival has a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:11.559" style="s2">schedule of the events and festival as</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.360" end="00:24:14.679" style="s2">the guys in charge of it it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.559" end="00:24:17.049" style="s2">what&#39;s up yeah so so if I go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.679" end="00:24:19.720" style="s2">notion of the question of those people</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.049" end="00:24:22.330" style="s2">for whom being a burner as part of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:24.520" style="s2">lived experience and by the way for</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.330" end="00:24:26.289" style="s2">everyone who isn&#39;t that you Quakers are</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.520" end="00:24:28.690" style="s2">equally capable in this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.289" end="00:24:32.440" style="s2">and I think are rare burners but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.690" end="00:24:35.230" style="s2">not exclusively impossible it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.440" end="00:24:38.110" style="s2">body embodied capacity it&#39;s just knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:40.780" style="s2">how to act in that way and then choosing</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.110" end="00:24:43.150" style="s2">to act in that way and everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.780" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">beginning to notice shits going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.150" end="00:24:48.370" style="s2">everywhere but those guys seemed not to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:51.429" style="s2">be freaking out what&#39;s that all about</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.370" end="00:24:53.650" style="s2">and again you don&#39;t teach you do and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.429" end="00:24:54.909" style="s2">just buying the act of doing you begin</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.650" end="00:24:56.500" style="s2">to do the thing and everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.909" end="00:24:58.030" style="s2">begins to learn because everybody Minh</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.500" end="00:24:59.350" style="s2">beings learned through emulation and wit</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.030" end="00:25:02.169" style="s2">they cannot possibly learn through</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.350" end="00:25:03.549" style="s2">didactics and by the way we should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.169" end="00:25:07.240" style="s2">able to kill human beings learn to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.549" end="00:25:08.809" style="s2">emulation via people who may perceive to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.240" end="00:25:11.480" style="s2">be like them in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.809" end="00:25:14.360" style="s2">meaningful way now what that means of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.480" end="00:25:16.429" style="s2">course is very respectable and in many</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.360" end="00:25:17.809" style="s2">ways I have very little in common with</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.429" end="00:25:19.669" style="s2">many of the people in this room and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.809" end="00:25:21.620" style="s2">the same time we may actually be right</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.669" end="00:25:22.730" style="s2">next to each other in terms of lightness</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.620" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">so it&#39;s not there&#39;s no way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.730" end="00:25:26.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s when you sense something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:28.490" style="s2">whoa there&#39;s something there that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.690" end="00:25:30.649" style="s2">actually really feel is a way for me to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.490" end="00:25:33.019" style="s2">learn that channel of learning through</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.649" end="00:25:35.889" style="s2">emulation is vast so be we should be</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.019" end="00:25:38.059" style="s2">aware of that right very careful</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.889" end="00:25:41.119" style="s2">teaching that we spend so much time in</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.059" end="00:25:43.009" style="s2">school there&#39;s a very bad model of what</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.119" end="00:25:44.869" style="s2">that function is we have this notion</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.009" end="00:25:46.669" style="s2">it&#39;s if we&#39;re crazy right it goes in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.869" end="00:25:48.889" style="s2">both directions on the one hand you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.669" end="00:25:50.450" style="s2">never emulate because there&#39;s no one to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.889" end="00:25:52.789" style="s2">emulate there&#39;s a teacher who&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.450" end="00:25:56.149" style="s2">not you and all the other kids anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.789" end="00:25:57.860" style="s2">you do like them is wrong so emulation</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.149" end="00:25:59.929" style="s2">is extinguished in our capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.860" end="00:26:01.220" style="s2">then this is sort of crazy didactic we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.929" end="00:26:02.749" style="s2">construct which is where all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.220" end="00:26:04.269" style="s2">attention is gone so if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.749" end="00:26:08.210" style="s2">unlearned all that shit very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.269" end="00:26:10.009" style="s2">like as rapidly as humanly possible and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.210" end="00:26:11.240" style="s2">this is a good opportunity right we have</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.009" end="00:26:13.369" style="s2">this cool opportunity where none of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.240" end="00:26:15.110" style="s2">kids are at school and all the people</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.369" end="00:26:16.850" style="s2">are kind of pulled from their addictions</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.110" end="00:26:19.220" style="s2">by you if you&#39;re not at the job that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.850" end="00:26:21.259" style="s2">taking your time for a long time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.220" end="00:26:23.659" style="s2">scary I get it it&#39;s very scary but</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.259" end="00:26:25.549" style="s2">trauma has the opportunity of pushing</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.659" end="00:26:26.990" style="s2">you into a place where you can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.549" end="00:26:28.850" style="s2">in desire to move to a different</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.100" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">back to normal you know people who</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">brought back to normal it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.259" end="00:26:44.450" style="s2">disorienting it feels uncanny because</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:47.419" style="s2">their body and soul knows that they have</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.140" end="00:33:30.630" style="s2">relearn how to actually be in family</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.550" end="00:33:32.400" style="s2">with each other is kind of a really</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.630" end="00:33:33.750" style="s2">serious blessing and that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.400" end="00:33:35.670" style="s2">first step of being able to actually do</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.750" end="00:33:37.530" style="s2">community is to have that skill</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.670" end="00:33:39.540" style="s2">because how do we do this to be in</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.530" end="00:33:41.010" style="s2">community is to be able to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.540" end="00:33:43.170" style="s2">reality that other people are hard to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.010" end="00:33:45.030" style="s2">deal with mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.170" end="00:33:48.920" style="s2">all right the contemporary environment</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.030" end="00:33:51.180" style="s2">ever since what probably the forties</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.920" end="00:33:54.510" style="s2">increasingly over time we&#39;ve had the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.180" end="00:33:55.860" style="s2">opportunity to migrate elsewhere fuck</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.510" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">the people who have heard of to deal</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:00.780" style="s2">be around people who were a lot like me</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.910" end="00:34:01.920" style="s2">well even better in the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.780" end="00:34:03.330" style="s2">environment fuck the people who are</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.429" end="00:34:13.770" style="s2">bubble three people who are all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.070" end="00:34:15.360" style="s2">circling we have to relearn that so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.770" end="00:34:16.980" style="s2">you can relearn that binding that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.360" end="00:34:18.090" style="s2">binding is powerful stuff because then</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.980" end="00:34:20.669" style="s2">you can actually do stuff across</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.090" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">boundaries interesting about sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.669" end="00:34:24.900" style="s2">making is that you know you have you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:26.429" style="s2">stuck with your family and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.900" end="00:34:29.550" style="s2">to learn the difficulties of that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.429" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">then when you co-creating or meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.550" end="00:34:33.390" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be turn into a family you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:34.590" style="s2">gonna have difficult quote difficult</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.390" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">people are different from you that</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:38.600" style="s2">if you don&#39;t get through that projects</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.770" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">not going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.600" end="00:34:46.169" style="s2">exactly exactly is that it helps you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:47.700" style="s2">understand why we&#39;re actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.169" end="00:34:48.570" style="s2">disconnected and disharmonious and where</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.700" end="00:34:51.780" style="s2">that&#39;s coming from</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.570" end="00:34:53.850" style="s2">well what I like about this and and what</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.780" end="00:34:55.770" style="s2">Jordans message is I was going to put</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.850" end="00:34:59.390" style="s2">this in your introduction but I was</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.770" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">feeling prefer time is this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.390" end="00:35:04.860" style="s2">being able to see from the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:07.050" style="s2">level is very high systems level because</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.860" end="00:35:10.050" style="s2">our world are so complex and being able</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.050" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">to deconstruct that but understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.050" end="00:35:17.360" style="s2">has to be tied into this human level of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:21.000" style="s2">family and perception and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.360" end="00:35:23.580" style="s2">this is for me where the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.000" end="00:35:26.730" style="s2">adjacent possible is and I you know we</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.580" end="00:35:28.830" style="s2">have Monica here on this call so kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.730" end="00:35:31.500" style="s2">talking to her reality to and that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.830" end="00:35:35.570" style="s2">there&#39;s this knowing that somehow this</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.500" end="00:35:39.030" style="s2">very new way this you know Burning Man</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.570" end="00:35:41.370" style="s2">new emergence is somehow dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.030" end="00:35:44.280" style="s2">reclaiming this old structure of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.370" end="00:35:46.260" style="s2">intergenerational transmission and I</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.280" end="00:35:48.780" style="s2">think so there&#39;s some people that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.260" end="00:35:52.230" style="s2">really into this new emergent but they</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.780" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">have not yet been able to repair their</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.230" end="00:35:58.920" style="s2">relationships with their family and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:36:01.550" style="s2">that that stunted miss is going to carry</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.920" end="00:36:04.620" style="s2">over into their system level work and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.550" end="00:36:12.800" style="s2">it&#39;s this this two sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.620" end="00:36:15.630" style="s2">clamshell the gap that that has not what</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.800" end="00:36:19.560" style="s2">waster okay Easter there&#39;s a pearl in</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.630" end="00:36:21.240" style="s2">there the to talk about because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.560" end="00:36:27.930" style="s2">a there&#39;s a pearl in there you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.240" end="00:36:29.700" style="s2">pearls are born of irritation just</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.930" end="00:36:31.320" style="s2">reflecting on the reality that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.700" end="00:36:32.490" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.320" end="00:36:35.130" style="s2">somebody if you&#39;re interpreting it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.490" end="00:36:37.710" style="s2">introduce real co-creative collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.130" end="00:36:40.680" style="s2">space and they haven&#39;t dealt with the</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.710" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">shit of their own personal projections</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.680" end="00:36:43.950" style="s2">around their mom their dad and their</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:45.060" style="s2">older sister they&#39;re gonna bring that</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.950" end="00:36:47.630" style="s2">right into the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.060" end="00:36:49.890" style="s2">collaboration exactly when it gets hot</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.630" end="00:36:50.970" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t here&#39;s to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.890" end="00:36:52.440" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to deal with that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.970" end="00:36:56.010" style="s2">the middle of an actual creative</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.440" end="00:36:57.870" style="s2">collaboration right so the second table</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.010" end="00:36:59.490" style="s2">stakes simple stocks like get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.870" end="00:37:00.660" style="s2">that stuff so you&#39;ve actually this when</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.490" end="00:37:04.140" style="s2">I type a solution of sovereignty is</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.660" end="00:37:05.550" style="s2">those kinds of things and then then the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.140" end="00:37:08.580" style="s2">space of creative collaboration becomes</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.550" end="00:37:10.790" style="s2">a lot more fluid because you can let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.580" end="00:37:13.980" style="s2">talk about multi perspectives /</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.790" end="00:37:16.530" style="s2">multi-perspective perspectival this</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.890" end="00:37:38.020" style="s2">to communicate for a while it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.070" end="00:37:39.400" style="s2">sound very weird you know it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.020" end="00:37:40.780" style="s2">that phrase you&#39;ve just been eating like</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.780" end="00:37:45.100" style="s2">each other how they even begin to try</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.810" end="00:37:46.660" style="s2">but if you can hold it together and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.100" end="00:37:48.130" style="s2">can actually have enough maturity and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.660" end="00:37:50.170" style="s2">enough ability to listen to the</p>

<p begin="00:37:50.170" end="00:37:54.520" style="s2">is enormous so that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.840" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the work right building that</p>

<p begin="00:38:11.890" end="00:38:16.090" style="s2">actually really figuring out to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.810" end="00:38:17.680" style="s2">recognize that there&#39;s a singularity in</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.680" end="00:38:22.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a real reality of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.750" end="00:38:27.250" style="s2">actually get that relationality be rich</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.200" end="00:38:28.510" style="s2">hey we have a question so anyway does</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.250" end="00:38:30.310" style="s2">anyone have a question that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.510" end="00:38:37.720" style="s2">going to open up to go to gallery view</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.310" end="00:38:43.390" style="s2">does anyone have a question you had a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.720" end="00:38:45.130" style="s2">question I want me to read it out loud</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.390" end="00:38:49.720" style="s2">or so just answer it cuz everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.130" end="00:38:54.070" style="s2">reading it go ahead ask my question</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.720" end="00:38:57.850" style="s2">Jordan is thank you for for for these</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.070" end="00:38:59.920" style="s2">insights like how to get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.850" end="00:39:02.860" style="s2">system and how to look at this this time</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.920" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">to get out of it can you share a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.860" end="00:39:11.350" style="s2">bit about what you on a personal level</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:13.180" style="s2">do to to make a change and how you work</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.350" end="00:39:14.860" style="s2">together with others what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.180" end="00:39:18.040" style="s2">you&#39;re doing what are the projects what</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.860" end="00:39:21.000" style="s2">are the type you focus your attention on</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.040" end="00:39:26.200" style="s2">that you&#39;ve chosen to do and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.000" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">choose to collaborate with others are</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.200" end="00:39:30.340" style="s2">you referring to right now like in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:32.320" style="s2">past three weeks or more broadly now</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.340" end="00:39:34.810" style="s2">what what do you choose to do like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.320" end="00:39:37.660" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about speaking but to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.810" end="00:39:40.360" style="s2">actually make crystals together and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.660" end="00:39:42.760" style="s2">stick those crystals together to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.360" end="00:39:45.850" style="s2">become one and one is 11 instead of one</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.760" end="00:39:47.830" style="s2">and one is two so my question is</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.850" end="00:39:51.160" style="s2">do you choose to do can you share</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.830" end="00:39:54.670" style="s2">something of the of the type of projects</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.160" end="00:39:56.740" style="s2">and specifically in this time that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.670" end="00:39:58.810" style="s2">choose to focus your attention to and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:40:03.790" style="s2">that you try to connect with with others</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.810" end="00:40:06.910" style="s2">sure what I would say this is almost the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.790" end="00:40:08.170" style="s2">experience that I&#39;m kind of feeling now</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.910" end="00:40:09.550" style="s2">so let&#39;s just focus on now</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.170" end="00:40:11.340" style="s2">maybe because now is the kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.550" end="00:40:14.080" style="s2">interesting and powerful environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.340" end="00:40:19.240" style="s2">Kairos right this this kind of time</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.080" end="00:40:22.060" style="s2">where things happen very rapidly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.240" end="00:40:23.560" style="s2">like three different layers two of which</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.060" end="00:40:25.600" style="s2">are very distinct what I would say an</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.560" end="00:40:28.510" style="s2">almost like modality or the tenor and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.600" end="00:40:30.220" style="s2">feeling of embodiment one has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.510" end="00:40:32.350" style="s2">the feeling of the flowing of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.220" end="00:40:35.350" style="s2">ability of allowing the intuition to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.350" end="00:40:40.030" style="s2">have free rein so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.350" end="00:40:42.040" style="s2">I do is I just notice like how do I say</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.030" end="00:40:45.100" style="s2">this like when you&#39;re actually in combat</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.040" end="00:40:46.630" style="s2">when you&#39;re fighting somebody you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.100" end="00:40:48.370" style="s2">think too hard about it at that point</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.630" end="00:40:50.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the time to drop the figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.370" end="00:40:52.510" style="s2">and just allow whatever capacity you</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.320" end="00:40:54.340" style="s2">have to make the choices you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.510" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">an absolute presence with what there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.340" end="00:40:58.630" style="s2">in the moment so a sizeable fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:00.580" style="s2">my time is that I&#39;m sitting watching</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.630" end="00:41:04.180" style="s2">everything that&#39;s going on and as soon</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.580" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">as I feel something arise in me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.180" end="00:41:07.750" style="s2">try to figure out what it is I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:11.230" style="s2">allow it to give to express itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.750" end="00:41:12.850" style="s2">through me so for example on the past</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.230" end="00:41:14.710" style="s2">couple of weeks I&#39;ve noticed every</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.850" end="00:41:18.610" style="s2">everyone smile something just pops up</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.710" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">this strikes me as being extremely clear</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.610" end="00:41:24.850" style="s2">and needs to be expressed broadly it has</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:26.470" style="s2">almost like a field effect it actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.850" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">feels very much like the feminine which</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.470" end="00:41:32.320" style="s2">is to say just orienting orientation</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.610" style="s2">Sensibility a couple of weeks ago I or</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.320" end="00:41:35.170" style="s2">maybe even two days ago by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.610" end="00:41:38.680" style="s2">apologize I&#39;ve lost track of ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.170" end="00:41:40.600" style="s2">Chronos time sent up the signal</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.680" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">everybody mental health be aware if</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.600" end="00:41:44.080" style="s2">you&#39;re focused right now on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.100" end="00:41:46.270" style="s2">if you&#39;re looking at like medical and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.080" end="00:41:48.030" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at-at finance or even</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.270" end="00:41:50.020" style="s2">like just buying food for your family</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.030" end="00:41:51.820" style="s2">anybody anywhere who has any orientation</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.020" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">in this direction just like pop</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.820" end="00:41:55.660" style="s2">attention attention attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.920" style="s2">but trying to get from me at least one</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.660" end="00:41:59.080" style="s2">of the things that I&#39;ve noticed is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.920" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">one of the characteristics that I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.080" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">been able to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:04.390" style="s2">service in the past has to do with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:07.180" style="s2">ability to have a broad broad sensing</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.390" end="00:42:10.089" style="s2">and then too quickly or notice when like</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.180" end="00:42:11.530" style="s2">to be a scout in the sense their point</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.089" end="00:42:13.480" style="s2">attention point of collective intention</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.530" end="00:42:14.970" style="s2">at something and to trust that I may be</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.480" end="00:42:17.230" style="s2">wrong I&#39;m going to take the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.970" end="00:42:18.460" style="s2">being wrong but hopes that also the</p>

<p begin="00:42:18.460" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">several years know how to use my signal</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.010" end="00:42:25.030" style="s2">as I&#39;m now committing myself to being</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.700" end="00:50:12.610" style="s2">adjacent possible so what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.470" end="00:50:16.230" style="s2">thinking about is kind of like three</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.610" end="00:50:19.150" style="s2">basic principles sever decoupled migrate</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.230" end="00:50:22.210" style="s2">sever there&#39;s some things to just need</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.150" end="00:50:23.830" style="s2">to go obvious shitty stuff that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.210" end="00:50:25.750" style="s2">need if we just got rid of it everything</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.830" end="00:50:30.070" style="s2">will be better tomorrow find out what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.750" end="00:50:32.140" style="s2">is and let it go decouple or there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.070" end="00:50:36.070" style="s2">some things that we need I&#39;ll give you</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.140" end="00:50:37.630" style="s2">an example big agriculture unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.070" end="00:50:40.990" style="s2">we have put ourselves in a bit of a bind</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.630" end="00:50:43.780" style="s2">there 66% of our productive agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.990" end="00:50:44.860" style="s2">is back full back hold into 4% of farms</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.780" end="00:50:47.650" style="s2">all of which are owned by large</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.860" end="00:50:49.540" style="s2">companies well we ain&#39;t going straight</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.650" end="00:50:52.150" style="s2">to small agriculture anytime soon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.540" end="00:50:54.030" style="s2">ok there are mechanisms where we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.150" end="00:50:55.990" style="s2">decouple that and begin to create</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.030" end="00:50:57.550" style="s2">constructs where for example the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.990" end="00:51:01.000" style="s2">economic system that we&#39;re in I</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.550" end="00:51:04.030" style="s2">apologize what I&#39;m about to say is not</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.000" end="00:51:05.800" style="s2">easily said and it&#39;s not obvious but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.030" end="00:51:07.930" style="s2">assure you that there are a very small</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.800" end="00:51:09.070" style="s2">number of relatively practical steps</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.930" end="00:51:11.770" style="s2">that can be put in place that will</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.070" end="00:51:13.360" style="s2">enable this to happen we can make small</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.770" end="00:51:16.600" style="s2">modifications to the way that we go</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.360" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">about doing things like money and the</p>

<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:26.820" style="s2">like making</p>

<p begin="00:51:26.820" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">could be the decouples our dependence on</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.859" end="00:51:36.010" style="s2">existing systems that over time will</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:38.730" style="s2">naturally migrate to completely</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.010" end="00:51:42.760" style="s2">different constructs so it&#39;s decouple</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.730" end="00:51:45.430" style="s2">sever decouple migrate all right don&#39;t</p>
