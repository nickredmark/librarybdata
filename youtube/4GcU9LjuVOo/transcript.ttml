<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:20.760" style="s2">let&#39;s get at it here hopefully I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.019" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">warm up and get my brain going and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.760" end="00:02:27.780" style="s2">answer some questions the first one 343</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:30.569" style="s2">people have voted this one up could you</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.780" end="00:02:32.849" style="s2">please discuss freewill and sam Harris&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.569" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">and others ideas of its non-existence</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.849" end="00:02:37.379" style="s2">well that&#39;s a good complicated question</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">to kick things off so I want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.379" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">a little bit about how to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:43.709" style="s2">freewill I think first because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:47.220" style="s2">obvious that we don&#39;t have infinite</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.709" end="00:02:49.110" style="s2">freewill our our choice our choices are</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">constrained in all sorts of ways and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.110" end="00:02:54.209" style="s2">think part of the reason that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">continual discussion about freewill in</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.209" end="00:03:00.360" style="s2">the philosophical in the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">literature is because just</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.360" end="00:03:04.829" style="s2">conceptualizing the issue properly is</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">extraordinarily difficult so I like to</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.829" end="00:03:09.930" style="s2">think about it at least in part the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:12.030" style="s2">that you think about a game you know if</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.930" end="00:03:14.069" style="s2">you&#39;re playing a game obviously the game</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.030" end="00:03:16.470" style="s2">has rules so if it&#39;s a chess game or a</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.069" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">basketball game then there are things</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.470" end="00:03:22.200" style="s2">that you can do and things that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.209" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">can&#39;t do and but and so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.200" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a closed world in some sense but</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:30.120" style="s2">the fact that there are things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:31.980" style="s2">do when you play a game also seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.120" end="00:03:34.650" style="s2">open up a universe of possibilities for</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.980" end="00:03:37.049" style="s2">things that you can do so chess</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.650" end="00:03:38.910" style="s2">obviously constrains you to a board and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.049" end="00:03:41.220" style="s2">to a certain number of men and to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.910" end="00:03:43.319" style="s2">certain pattern of rules but the strange</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.220" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">thing is is that when you put in those</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.319" end="00:03:46.829" style="s2">rules because rules sound like limits</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.290" style="s2">they sound always like things you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.829" end="00:03:52.230" style="s2">do but when you set up a constrained</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.290" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">world like that and you lay out a system</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.230" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">of rules what you do is open up an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:58.590" style="s2">infinity of a near infinity of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:01.769" style="s2">possibilities same with music you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.590" end="00:04:03.209" style="s2">music has rules obviously and if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.769" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">follow the rules then you can make an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.209" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">infinite variety of music and so and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:13.430" style="s2">dynamic that&#39;s hard to understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.340" end="00:04:15.750" style="s2">between constraint and possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.430" end="00:04:17.489" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep idea that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.750" end="00:04:20.130" style="s2">with that that I read in some Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.489" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">commentary on the biblical stories that</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.130" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">I I read a long time ago talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.780" style="s2">the relationship between God and man and</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:32.130" style="s2">the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.780" end="00:04:33.870" style="s2">God imagine a being with the classical</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.130" end="00:04:36.330" style="s2">attributes of God omniscience</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.870" end="00:04:38.490" style="s2">omnipotence and omnipresence all-seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.330" end="00:04:41.430" style="s2">all-knowing and all-powerful what is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.490" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">being like that lack and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:47.490" style="s2">answer is nothing right because by</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:49.650" style="s2">definition those three traits provide</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.490" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">for absence of limitation but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.650" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s lacking is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">limitation and there&#39;s some strange</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">connection between limitation and and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:01.410" style="s2">was saying say limitation that it&#39;s rule</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:05.100" style="s2">governed as I mentioned before and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.410" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">opening up of possibility so that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.100" end="00:05:08.940" style="s2">necessarily the case that now determine</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:10.230" style="s2">determinism and limitation aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.940" end="00:05:11.760" style="s2">exactly the same thing but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.230" end="00:05:13.950" style="s2">analogous and they need to be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.760" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">together okay so though so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.950" end="00:05:19.200" style="s2">first thing is that or whatever our free</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:21.300" style="s2">choice is it isn&#39;t limited it&#39;s or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.200" end="00:05:23.730" style="s2">limited it&#39;s it&#39;s deeply limited now</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.300" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">here&#39;s another thing if I take my arm</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.730" end="00:05:29.550" style="s2">and I go like this you see I&#39;ll do that</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">again now you see there&#39;s a movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.550" end="00:05:36.390" style="s2">like that and then my hand stopped just</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:37.979" style="s2">before my my other hand now it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.390" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">certain amount of time for the neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.979" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">messages to go from my brain to my arm</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:46.530" style="s2">and back and the time it takes my hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:48.090" style="s2">to go like this and stop is actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.530" end="00:05:50.310" style="s2">shorter than the time it takes a message</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.090" end="00:05:53.460" style="s2">to get to my brain and back so what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.310" end="00:05:55.050" style="s2">means is that when I when I plan this</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.460" end="00:05:56.580" style="s2">movement which is called a ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.050" end="00:05:58.169" style="s2">movement it&#39;s called a ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.580" end="00:05:59.760" style="s2">movement because it&#39;s like a bullet once</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.169" end="00:06:02.460" style="s2">you let it go it&#39;s gone there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.760" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">calling it back I&#39;ve actually organized</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.460" end="00:06:07.020" style="s2">the neurological and muscular sequences</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">that enable that action before it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.020" end="00:06:11.250" style="s2">implemented I set all that up and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:15.870" style="s2">it&#39;s released and the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.250" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">cascades and so once the action has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.870" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">released let&#39;s say then I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:23.130" style="s2">have any free will because I can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.130" end="00:06:24.450" style="s2">it now so so you think about that it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.130" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">looks like there&#39;s a temporal gradient</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.450" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">with regards to free will is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">look out into the future may perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:35.940" style="s2">farther out you look into the future</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">the farther down the road let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.940" end="00:06:39.419" style="s2">more free your choices are but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:40.910" style="s2">closer they get to implementation the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.419" end="00:06:43.730" style="s2">more they become</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.910" end="00:06:45.530" style="s2">Mystic governed by standard cause of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.730" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">processes and there&#39;s some transition</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.530" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">point where they change from being what</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:52.310" style="s2">we would describe as choice that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:54.380" style="s2">haven&#39;t got to free choice yet but at</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.310" end="00:06:55.910" style="s2">least a choice there&#39;s some transition</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.380" end="00:06:57.320" style="s2">point between that and ballistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.910" end="00:06:59.060" style="s2">movement here&#39;s another way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.320" end="00:07:00.830" style="s2">about it like we know for example that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.060" end="00:07:03.410" style="s2">people who are expert at playing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.830" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">piano look ahead of where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.410" end="00:07:08.270" style="s2">playing and and they&#39;re doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:11.000" style="s2">thing they&#39;re watching the notes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.270" end="00:07:13.160" style="s2">seeing where they&#39;re going but and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.000" end="00:07:15.230" style="s2">they&#39;re disinhibited the automated</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.160" end="00:07:17.330" style="s2">structures that enable them to play what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.230" end="00:07:19.850" style="s2">they&#39;ve practiced so thoroughly they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.330" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">disinhibited those structures and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.850" end="00:07:23.210" style="s2">they go automatically and then what</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.650" end="00:07:25.850" style="s2">happens if you make a mistake is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.210" end="00:07:28.580" style="s2">consciousness notes the error and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.850" end="00:07:30.500" style="s2">unpacks the motor sequences that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.580" end="00:07:32.090" style="s2">been practiced and then yuri practice</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.500" end="00:07:34.460" style="s2">them and sequence them again until they</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.090" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">become automatic and deterministic so</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.460" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s choice in that you&#39;re reading</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:40.940" style="s2">ahead but there&#39;s no choice in that once</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:42.860" style="s2">you&#39;ve read ahead and disinhibited the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.940" end="00:07:44.780" style="s2">actions then they run ballistically and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.860" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">then you can think about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.780" end="00:07:48.500" style="s2">that&#39;s happening when you&#39;re driving in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">a car you don&#39;t look right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.500" end="00:07:52.070" style="s2">you when you&#39;re driving a car because</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:53.330" style="s2">whatever is right in front of you if</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.070" end="00:07:55.730" style="s2">you&#39;re going 40 miles an hour or</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.330" end="00:07:57.500" style="s2">whatever you&#39;ve already run over you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.730" end="00:07:59.510" style="s2">look a quarter of a mile down the road</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.500" end="00:08:02.570" style="s2">and that gives you the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.510" end="00:08:04.430" style="s2">see what&#39;s coming and to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.570" end="00:08:06.860" style="s2">sequence of increasingly automated</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.430" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">movements that culminate in whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">is that you&#39;re doing while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.850" end="00:08:13.190" style="s2">driving and so there&#39;s a gradation from</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:16.460" style="s2">choice to determinism a temporal</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.190" end="00:08:17.690" style="s2">gradation and and I don&#39;t often see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">addressed when people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.690" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">freewill now Sam&#39;s issue is freewill is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:28.190" style="s2">that if you get someone to do something</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">like lift their finger and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.190" end="00:08:31.910" style="s2">scan their brains using a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:34.039" style="s2">techniques while they&#39;re doing that what</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.910" end="00:08:36.229" style="s2">you&#39;ll see is that there&#39;s an action</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.039" end="00:08:37.849" style="s2">potential that Emer and you ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.229" end="00:08:40.000" style="s2">voluntarily move their finger so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.849" end="00:08:42.560" style="s2">doing it let&#39;s say by free choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.000" end="00:08:44.120" style="s2">there&#39;s an action potential that you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:47.000" style="s2">read that you can read off the brain</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.120" end="00:08:49.160" style="s2">that occurs before the person either</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.000" end="00:08:51.350" style="s2">moves their finger or let&#39;s say decides</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.160" end="00:08:53.750" style="s2">to move their finger and that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.350" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">quite a bit before the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.750" end="00:08:56.850" style="s2">volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:08:58.920" style="s2">or that voluntary act and so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.850" end="00:09:03.209" style="s2">read by Benjamin Libet who did the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.920" end="00:09:04.740" style="s2">experiments as indication that even the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.209" end="00:09:07.290" style="s2">feeling of voluntary choice is</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.740" end="00:09:10.649" style="s2">determined but I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.290" end="00:09:14.250" style="s2">a very useful way of addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.649" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">issue because the the issue of when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.250" end="00:09:18.899" style="s2">lift your finger in up again is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:20.940" style="s2">requires pre-programming to dis inhibit</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.899" end="00:09:22.200" style="s2">like you know how to do this right you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.940" end="00:09:23.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have to learn to do that so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.200" end="00:09:25.529" style="s2">have a little automated circuit that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.820" end="00:09:26.820" style="s2">does this sort of thing all these finger</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.529" end="00:09:28.800" style="s2">movements and everything you can see</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.820" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">babies practicing them and they develop</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.800" end="00:09:33.209" style="s2">automated circuitry that tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:36.149" style="s2">posterior left hemisphere in order to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.209" end="00:09:37.950" style="s2">run those those automated processes out</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.149" end="00:09:40.769" style="s2">and what you&#39;re basically doing when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.950" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">decide to do something that&#39;s a routine</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.769" end="00:09:43.950" style="s2">that you&#39;ve already practiced or made</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:47.310" style="s2">out of subroutines that you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.950" end="00:09:49.140" style="s2">practiced is disinhibited them and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.310" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">the degree to which you might regard</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.140" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">that as free exactly is unclear as are</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:55.940" style="s2">the temporal limitations so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.200" style="s2">think that libbets experiments</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.940" end="00:09:59.730" style="s2">demonstrate conclusively that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.200" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">such thing as free will even though</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.730" end="00:10:03.810" style="s2">there are action potentials that</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:06.029" style="s2">indicate that there is brain activity</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.810" end="00:10:11.630" style="s2">signaling even the onset of a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.029" end="00:10:14.279" style="s2">choice voluntary choice early now</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.630" end="00:10:18.839" style="s2">another thing that we might look at in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.279" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">relationship to that is yeah so we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.839" end="00:10:22.769" style="s2">look at it phenomenologically and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.310" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">could also look at it in in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.769" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">relationship to how people treat one</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:29.640" style="s2">another so phenomenologically it seems</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.230" style="s2">clear that we have free choice and it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.640" end="00:10:33.269" style="s2">isn&#39;t obvious to me why we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.230" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">consciousness if free choice isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.269" end="00:10:38.070" style="s2">because consciousness looks to me like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:39.959" style="s2">mechanism that deals with potential</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.070" end="00:10:42.839" style="s2">before it&#39;s transformed into actuality</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.959" end="00:10:46.529" style="s2">let&#39;s say and and I think consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.839" end="00:10:48.870" style="s2">is also they the Faculty so to speak or</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.529" end="00:10:50.970" style="s2">a manifestation of the faculty that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.870" end="00:10:52.769" style="s2">enables us to pre-program deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.970" end="00:10:54.329" style="s2">actions so again let&#39;s think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.769" end="00:10:56.430" style="s2">someone playing the piano they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.329" end="00:10:59.130" style="s2">practicing you know after you repeat and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.430" end="00:11:00.510" style="s2">you repeat your finger movements if</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.130" end="00:11:01.890" style="s2">you&#39;re playing the piano any complex</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.510" end="00:11:03.329" style="s2">motor skill is like that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.890" end="00:11:05.550" style="s2">repeat it and repeat it repeat it and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.329" end="00:11:08.190" style="s2">repeat it and you&#39;re using consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.550" end="00:11:10.140" style="s2">to program it to sequence the motor move</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.190" end="00:11:12.630" style="s2">limits and to pay attention to them that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.140" end="00:11:14.310" style="s2">all seems voluntary and it involves the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.630" end="00:11:15.390" style="s2">activation of a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.310" end="00:11:17.430" style="s2">your brain because if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.390" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">something new a lot of your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.430" end="00:11:22.760" style="s2">activated and then as you practice it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.680" end="00:11:24.990" style="s2">the amount of brain that&#39;s activated</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.760" end="00:11:27.830" style="s2">decreases it shifts from right to left</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.990" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">and then it shifts from frontal to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.830" end="00:11:31.950" style="s2">posterior and a smaller and smaller area</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:34.020" style="s2">so what&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.950" end="00:11:36.120" style="s2">consciousness is creating little</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.020" end="00:11:43.560" style="s2">machines in the back of your head that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.120" end="00:11:48.840" style="s2">do things in an automated manner and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.560" end="00:11:50.400" style="s2">the the voluntas &#39;no Sapir and feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.840" end="00:11:52.290" style="s2">that would be the phenomenological end</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.400" end="00:11:53.970" style="s2">as if it&#39;s doing that voluntarily and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.290" end="00:11:57.630" style="s2">is associated with a different pattern</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.970" end="00:11:59.420" style="s2">of brain activity and so okay so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.630" end="00:12:02.850" style="s2">that there&#39;s the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.420" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">reality of voluntary choice and effort</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.850" end="00:12:06.300" style="s2">as well because conscious programming of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:07.950" style="s2">that sort is also effortful it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.300" end="00:12:11.940" style="s2">seem to run deterministically like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.950" end="00:12:13.680" style="s2">clock does and then finally there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.940" end="00:12:17.610" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know what you think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.680" end="00:12:19.290" style="s2">this with regards to evidence but what</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:21.390" style="s2">constitutes evidence is not always that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.290" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">easy to determine even in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.390" end="00:12:26.580" style="s2">domain so emeriti think about how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:28.140" style="s2">think about ourselves and other people</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.580" end="00:12:31.050" style="s2">and how we treat ourselves and other</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.140" end="00:12:33.090" style="s2">people you could imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.050" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">like a clock running down and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.090" end="00:12:36.300" style="s2">like a deterministic model but people</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.860" end="00:12:37.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t clocks were dissipative</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.300" end="00:12:41.850" style="s2">structures a clock is something that</p>

<p begin="00:12:41.850" end="00:12:44.670" style="s2">look up dissipative structure I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:47.480" style="s2">that was an idea that was first</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.670" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">formulated by the physicist Schrodinger</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.480" end="00:12:55.350" style="s2">we were we&#39;re not we&#39;re not clocks by</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.740" end="00:12:57.210" style="s2">any stretch of the imagination and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.350" end="00:13:01.589" style="s2">take energy in and we disperse energy</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.210" end="00:13:03.510" style="s2">and and we were anti-entropic in in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.589" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">temporary sense so that makes us and and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.510" end="00:13:07.140" style="s2">so and life is as well shorting a wrote</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:13.050" style="s2">about that in a book called what is life</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.140" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">and we don&#39;t what we seem to do this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.050" end="00:13:17.910" style="s2">how it looks to me we don&#39;t content with</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:20.430" style="s2">the present and we&#39;re not driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.910" end="00:13:21.300" style="s2">past instead what we see in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.430" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.300" end="00:13:26.730" style="s2">landscape of possibility and in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:28.290" style="s2">Wilder moments I think that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.730" end="00:13:30.630" style="s2">with the physical idea of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.290" end="00:13:33.060" style="s2">universes but that&#39;s in my Wilder</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.630" end="00:13:35.070" style="s2">moments it&#39;s just a speculation and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.060" end="00:13:37.800" style="s2">what we see in front of us is a an array</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.070" end="00:13:39.300" style="s2">of potential universes and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.800" end="00:13:42.149" style="s2">universes that we could bring about as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.300" end="00:13:44.130" style="s2">consequence of our actions and it and we</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.149" end="00:13:45.329" style="s2">make choices to the right or the left</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.130" end="00:13:47.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of mythological</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.329" end="00:13:50.399" style="s2">speculation about that sort of idea - in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.790" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">an ethical sense because we decide what</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.399" end="00:13:54.630" style="s2">sort of reality that we want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">into being and so we encounter potential</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.630" end="00:14:01.290" style="s2">like God did at the beginning of time</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:02.910" style="s2">when he made order out of chaos chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.290" end="00:14:04.709" style="s2">this chaotic potential we confront</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.910" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">chaotic potential with our consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.709" end="00:14:11.190" style="s2">and we cast that into reality and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">now then you think well is that really</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.190" end="00:14:16.200" style="s2">the case well that&#39;s hard to say because</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:18.570" style="s2">there are limits to our knowledge about</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.200" end="00:14:20.579" style="s2">consciousness and about reality but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.570" end="00:14:22.709" style="s2">you treat yourself like you&#39;re a free</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.579" end="00:14:25.290" style="s2">moral agent with choice and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.709" end="00:14:26.940" style="s2">determine the course of your life then</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.290" end="00:14:28.770" style="s2">you seem to get along better with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.940" end="00:14:30.750" style="s2">yourself and to be less anxious and to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.770" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">be more productive and if you treat</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.750" end="00:14:34.410" style="s2">other people like that that they&#39;re free</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">agents that are making voluntary choices</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.410" end="00:14:38.250" style="s2">about how reality is going to come into</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:41.130" style="s2">being and you reward them when they do</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.250" end="00:14:43.230" style="s2">it properly and you punish them or</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.130" end="00:14:46.170" style="s2">otherwise discipline them when they</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.230" end="00:14:48.120" style="s2">don&#39;t when they do it badly then your</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.170" end="00:14:51.870" style="s2">relationships with them seem to work and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.120" end="00:14:53.640" style="s2">then if we predicate our society on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.870" end="00:14:55.410" style="s2">presupposition that each individual</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.640" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">human being is capable of doing just</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.410" end="00:14:57.690" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.570" style="s2">then we seem to have extremely</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.690" end="00:15:02.520" style="s2">functional societies and so and this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.570" end="00:15:04.230" style="s2">something that sam harris has been taken</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.520" end="00:15:07.320" style="s2">to task for many times is if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.230" end="00:15:09.690" style="s2">dispense with the idea of freewill how</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.320" end="00:15:11.820" style="s2">is it you organize your relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.690" end="00:15:13.589" style="s2">yourself your interactions with your</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.820" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">family and your relationships with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.589" end="00:15:20.550" style="s2">broader social community it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:22.649" style="s2">complicated issue so I believe strongly</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.550" end="00:15:24.480" style="s2">that we have freewill that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.649" end="00:15:26.670" style="s2">responsible for our choices those</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:29.100" style="s2">choices are constrained in many many</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.670" end="00:15:33.000" style="s2">ways I think there&#39;s a gradient of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.100" end="00:15:35.160" style="s2">freewill from free out into the future</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.000" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">to increasingly constrained as the press</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.160" end="00:15:40.490" style="s2">manifests itself to deterministic in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.899" style="s2">moment when with in the moment of action</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.490" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">we and that we might think that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.899" end="00:15:46.350" style="s2">entered the realm of deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:48.300" style="s2">causality at the moment of action</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.350" end="00:15:52.379" style="s2">something like that that&#39;s how it looks</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.300" end="00:15:53.910" style="s2">to me so well so at this rate we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.379" end="00:15:55.470" style="s2">gonna answer about five questions so</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.910" end="00:15:57.649" style="s2">that but that was a very very hard one</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.470" end="00:16:01.079" style="s2">so anyways I hope that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.649" end="00:16:03.480" style="s2">Maelstrom who is apparently chaos given</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.079" end="00:16:06.329" style="s2">the name asked me am i chaos or am i</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.480" end="00:16:08.459" style="s2">order well that&#39;s a good question I</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.329" end="00:16:10.589" style="s2">would say a lot of the time I&#39;m chaos</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.459" end="00:16:14.459" style="s2">but I do everything I can to put things</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.589" end="00:16:17.459" style="s2">in order but I&#39;m going to answer that in</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.459" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">the deeper way I would say because first</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.459" end="00:16:22.500" style="s2">of all everything and everyone is chaos</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.920" end="00:16:24.449" style="s2">and order at the same time and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.500" end="00:16:26.689" style="s2">mean that in a trait sense I mean it in</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.449" end="00:16:28.920" style="s2">a technical sense which is order</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.689" end="00:16:31.079" style="s2">technically speaking in my way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.920" end="00:16:33.240" style="s2">viewing the world is order is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.079" end="00:16:35.009" style="s2">domain you inhabit when what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:37.439" style="s2">doing produces the results that you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.009" end="00:16:39.660" style="s2">to have happen that&#39;s a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.439" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">perspective from from a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.660" end="00:16:43.380" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s derived at least in</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:49.079" style="s2">part or is analogous to the pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.380" end="00:16:51.930" style="s2">of people like CS purse and William</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.079" end="00:16:56.220" style="s2">James the the American American</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.930" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">pragmatists and there&#39;s a great book on</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.220" end="00:17:02.610" style="s2">all that if you&#39;re interested called the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:04.199" style="s2">metaphysical Club so order is where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.610" end="00:17:05.909" style="s2">are when what you&#39;re doing is producing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.199" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">the results that you intended and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.909" end="00:17:09.270" style="s2">validates what you&#39;re doing by the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:11.939" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a pragmatic form of truth</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.270" end="00:17:13.770" style="s2">your theory is accurate when if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.939" end="00:17:16.169" style="s2">enact it then the results that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.770" end="00:17:17.909" style="s2">intend emerge that&#39;s the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.169" end="00:17:20.130" style="s2">truth from a pragmatic perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.909" end="00:17:21.720" style="s2">a very powerful definition and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.130" end="00:17:24.480" style="s2">much associated with the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.720" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">notion of truth so that&#39;s worth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.480" end="00:17:31.830" style="s2">worth looking into now obviously there</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:33.870" style="s2">are times when you implement a plan and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.830" end="00:17:36.900" style="s2">a world conception that goes along with</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.870" end="00:17:40.140" style="s2">that plan and what you wanted didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.900" end="00:17:42.120" style="s2">happen and so then the domain of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.140" end="00:17:43.710" style="s2">comes up the domain of the unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.120" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">and unexpected and you have to contend</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.710" end="00:17:48.510" style="s2">with it and sometimes when you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">acting you do perverse things</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.510" end="00:17:54.450" style="s2">and things that that surprise you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:56.280" style="s2">then things don&#39;t work out well for you</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.450" end="00:17:58.140" style="s2">or or maybe you get a surprise and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.280" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">sometimes that might even be positive</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.140" end="00:18:02.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s because the chaos within you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:04.080" style="s2">has manifested itself and you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:06.510" style="s2">something that exceeds the bounds of</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.080" end="00:18:08.130" style="s2">your understanding and you know that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.510" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">happen to people so badly that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.130" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">develop post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:14.760" style="s2">post-traumatic stress disorder sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">soldiers especially naive young soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.760" end="00:18:17.490" style="s2">will go on a battlefield and watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:19.080" style="s2">themselves do something they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.490" end="00:18:20.610" style="s2">imagine they&#39;re capable of doing and</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.080" end="00:18:22.710" style="s2">then they have permanent post-traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.610" end="00:18:25.320" style="s2">stress disorder so there&#39;s a chaos</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.710" end="00:18:28.380" style="s2">within that can manifest itself that can</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.320" end="00:18:30.150" style="s2">disrupt whatever order you are and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.380" end="00:18:32.250" style="s2">know that minor ways because everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.150" end="00:18:33.630" style="s2">always running around doing things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.250" end="00:18:35.250" style="s2">aren&#39;t good for them that they know they</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.630" end="00:18:38.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do and that they can&#39;t control</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.250" end="00:18:40.679" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a chaotic and an orderly</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.370" end="00:18:43.230" style="s2">aspect to everything to the individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.679" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">to the family to the social world to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.230" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">natural world it&#39;s chaos and order at</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">every level of analysis simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:51.059" style="s2">which is why the Daoists think of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:54.510" style="s2">world is made out of yin and yang which</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.059" end="00:18:57.720" style="s2">is essentially analogous to the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.720" end="00:19:02.880" style="s2">another element too so your order and</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.059" end="00:19:04.770" style="s2">your chaos and the place that you live</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.880" end="00:19:07.890" style="s2">the environment is order and chaos as</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.770" end="00:19:10.260" style="s2">well but you&#39;re also the process that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.890" end="00:19:12.090" style="s2">mediates between the two and what that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.260" end="00:19:14.190" style="s2">means is you&#39;re the force that confronts</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.090" end="00:19:15.780" style="s2">chaos and casts it into order we talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.190" end="00:19:18.299" style="s2">about that in the free will discussion</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.780" end="00:19:20.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the basis for the dragon myth or</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.299" end="00:19:22.020" style="s2">at least part of it the hero myth you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.250" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">the force that confronts chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.020" end="00:19:25.770" style="s2">transforms it into habitable order and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:28.049" style="s2">there&#39;s an idea that if you do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.770" end="00:19:30.330" style="s2">using truthful speech it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.049" end="00:19:33.030" style="s2">deepest idea in the Bible if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:34.980" style="s2">confront chaos and the unknown using</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.030" end="00:19:38.940" style="s2">truthful speech then the order that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.980" end="00:19:41.220" style="s2">produce is good so that also means that</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.940" end="00:19:43.020" style="s2">your chaos and order and the process</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.220" end="00:19:45.000" style="s2">that intermediates between them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.020" end="00:19:47.669" style="s2">that&#39;s really the basis of the hero myth</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.000" end="00:19:49.620" style="s2">so part of that is the hero story and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.669" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">the dragon myth go out confront the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.620" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">dragon get the gold bring it back share</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:56.010" style="s2">it with the community and the dragon is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:59.070" style="s2">a representation of that which dwells</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.010" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">beyond the confines of the safe and</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.070" end="00:20:02.169" style="s2">habitable space right it&#39;s an image of a</p>

<p begin="00:20:02.169" end="00:20:05.799" style="s2">part of what it is although it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.460" end="00:20:07.720" style="s2">more complicated than that and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.799" end="00:20:10.200" style="s2">also of the force that confronts order</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.720" end="00:20:13.029" style="s2">when it becomes too tyrannical and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.200" end="00:20:14.919" style="s2">restructures it back to chaos and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.029" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">restructures the chaos back into more</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.919" end="00:20:19.149" style="s2">beneficial order which is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:21.129" style="s2">for example if you have an argument with</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.149" end="00:20:25.149" style="s2">someone that you settle right because</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.129" end="00:20:26.619" style="s2">the argument takes the orderly relation</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.149" end="00:20:28.840" style="s2">that you have with that person and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.619" end="00:20:30.460" style="s2">produces a chaotic interlude which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.840" end="00:20:32.830" style="s2">all the pain that&#39;s associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.460" end="00:20:35.049" style="s2">argument and that&#39;s a dissolution into</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.830" end="00:20:37.629" style="s2">what Murchie Aliotti called pre</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.049" end="00:20:40.809" style="s2">cosmogonic chaos and out of that a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.629" end="00:20:43.539" style="s2">order can emerge and so the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.809" end="00:20:45.999" style="s2">construe yourself is not as chaos or as</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.539" end="00:20:48.970" style="s2">order but as the process that mediates</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.999" end="00:20:51.220" style="s2">between them and that&#39;s the basis for</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.970" end="00:20:53.739" style="s2">the ethos of the West is that the human</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.220" end="00:20:56.350" style="s2">being is best represented as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.739" end="00:20:59.049" style="s2">individual and the individual is that</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.049" end="00:21:04.239" style="s2">is continually capable of mediating</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.200" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">properly between chaos and order now</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.239" end="00:21:10.149" style="s2">this is a deep idea you could read maps</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:12.039" style="s2">of meaning if you would like the audio</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.039" end="00:21:15.609" style="s2">by the way and I will make a video</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.889" end="00:21:22.359" style="s2">you can construe yourself you should</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.019" end="00:21:24.850" style="s2">construe yourself as the process that</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.359" end="00:21:26.980" style="s2">mediates between chaos and order and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.850" end="00:21:28.889" style="s2">should aim to be the process that does</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.489" end="00:21:38.859" style="s2">balanced and you might say yeah but is</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:40.629" style="s2">that real well if you read maps of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.859" end="00:21:42.489" style="s2">meaning there&#39;s a section on neural</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.629" end="00:21:44.980" style="s2">psychology that&#39;s also buttress by a</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.489" end="00:21:46.659" style="s2">book written by Ian McGilchrist called</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.980" end="00:21:48.850" style="s2">the master and his emissary that lays</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.659" end="00:21:51.220" style="s2">out the relationship between the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.850" end="00:21:52.929" style="s2">and left hemisphere now it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.220" end="00:21:55.299" style="s2">strange that we have a right and left</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.929" end="00:21:57.700" style="s2">hemisphere it&#39;s almost as if we have two</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.299" end="00:22:00.970" style="s2">consciousness as dwelling in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.700" end="00:22:02.590" style="s2">in our in our being and they&#39;re quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.970" end="00:22:04.749" style="s2">separable if you cut the corpus callosum</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.590" end="00:22:06.429" style="s2">that unites the two then the two</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.749" end="00:22:07.629" style="s2">hemispheres will act independently to</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.429" end="00:22:09.549" style="s2">some degree you can communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.629" end="00:22:10.749" style="s2">each of them somewhat independently so</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.549" end="00:22:11.379" style="s2">they actually view the world quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.749" end="00:22:13.869" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.379" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">and that that hemispheric distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.869" end="00:22:16.760" style="s2">not only their human being</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:19.490" style="s2">but also in animals long way down the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.760" end="00:22:21.820" style="s2">phylogenetic chain now I made the claim</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.490" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">partly because I was reading a man named</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:26.750" style="s2">El Cajon and Goldberg who was a student</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:28.490" style="s2">of Alexander Luria the most brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.750" end="00:22:32.750" style="s2">neuropsychologist of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.490" end="00:22:37.250" style="s2">and and Goldberg made the case that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.750" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">left hemisphere is specialized for for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.250" end="00:22:41.240" style="s2">what&#39;s known and the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:43.059" style="s2">specialized for normally and feeis</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.240" end="00:22:46.610" style="s2">Ramachandran who&#39;s a famous neurologist</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.059" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">an MD in in California has also made a</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.610" end="00:22:50.870" style="s2">very similar claim based on his analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:53.299" style="s2">of brain-damaged individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.870" end="00:22:54.889" style="s2">Goldberg&#39;s case was the left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.299" end="00:22:56.809" style="s2">is specialized for what you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.889" end="00:22:58.370" style="s2">do and the right hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.809" end="00:23:01.220" style="s2">specialized for response to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.370" end="00:23:04.370" style="s2">unknown and that maps on to this order</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.220" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">chaos dimension right and the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.370" end="00:23:09.320" style="s2">hemisphere now McGilchrist in his book</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:10.669" style="s2">the master and his emissary has pointed</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.320" end="00:23:12.620" style="s2">out quite clearly that the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.669" end="00:23:15.669" style="s2">hemisphere has a tyrannical tendency</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.620" end="00:23:17.720" style="s2">which it Ramachandran also viewed in his</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.669" end="00:23:19.639" style="s2">brain-damaged patients by the way and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.720" end="00:23:22.490" style="s2">that the left hemisphere is always</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.639" end="00:23:24.260" style="s2">trying to impose its logical and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.490" end="00:23:26.450" style="s2">restricted order on the world and to</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.260" end="00:23:29.149" style="s2">make the world fit into that now it has</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.450" end="00:23:31.250" style="s2">to do that there&#39;s reasons for that part</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.149" end="00:23:32.870" style="s2">of the reason is is that if your theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.250" end="00:23:34.220" style="s2">you&#39;ve worked on for 10 years makes one</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.870" end="00:23:35.990" style="s2">prediction error you shouldn&#39;t throw the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.220" end="00:23:38.029" style="s2">whole damn thing out you should doubt</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.990" end="00:23:39.679" style="s2">the prediction error right because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.029" end="00:23:42.470" style="s2">never know when your data is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.679" end="00:23:46.570" style="s2">data or is just another kind of theory</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.470" end="00:23:48.980" style="s2">we can&#39;t get into that at the moment now</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.570" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">McGilchrist makes a very strong case and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.980" end="00:23:53.059" style="s2">and I think a more elaborated case than</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:55.010" style="s2">I made in maps of meaning but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.059" end="00:23:58.130" style="s2">same argument fundamentally that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.010" end="00:24:00.590" style="s2">right hemisphere is concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.130" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">reaction to anomaly and so so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.590" end="00:24:04.190" style="s2">happens in some sense is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:06.590" style="s2">unexpected happens that&#39;s the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.190" end="00:24:08.450" style="s2">chaos and that stops you in your tracks</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.590" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">it freezes you and that&#39;s a predator</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">response or prey response actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:15.409" style="s2">you&#39;re frozen the unknown has manifested</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.669" style="s2">itself you&#39;re not in order anymore you</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.409" end="00:24:18.350" style="s2">don&#39;t know where you are and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.669" end="00:24:20.120" style="s2">know what to do and so and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.350" end="00:24:22.610" style="s2">just shut down like a computer does you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.120" end="00:24:24.830" style="s2">freeze instead and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.610" end="00:24:26.750" style="s2">that the ancient mechanisms that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.830" end="00:24:28.280" style="s2">helped our ancestors for tens of</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.950" end="00:24:35.540" style="s2">lurks beyond the confines of the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.230" end="00:24:37.610" style="s2">kick in and you start first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.540" end="00:24:39.800" style="s2">that&#39;s motoric so you freeze and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.610" end="00:24:42.050" style="s2">you cautiously start to explore and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.800" end="00:24:44.150" style="s2">it&#39;s imagistic you start making imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.050" end="00:24:46.340" style="s2">representations metaphoric</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.150" end="00:24:48.590" style="s2">representations dramatic representations</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.340" end="00:24:51.530" style="s2">of what might constitute the unknown and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.590" end="00:24:53.240" style="s2">then those representations are practiced</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.530" end="00:24:55.010" style="s2">and implemented in the world and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.240" end="00:24:57.290" style="s2">become more and more fine-grained and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.010" end="00:24:59.630" style="s2">automatized and as that happens the</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.290" end="00:25:02.680" style="s2">locale that they&#39;re represented in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.630" end="00:25:04.940" style="s2">the brain shifts from right to left so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.680" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">so so the reason I&#39;m telling you all</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.940" end="00:25:09.800" style="s2">this is because you know this is where</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:11.210" style="s2">the metaphysical and the physical unites</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.800" end="00:25:12.980" style="s2">and this is the sort of argument that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.210" end="00:25:14.420" style="s2">was trying to make to Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.980" end="00:25:15.860" style="s2">hopefully we&#39;ll be able to continue</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.420" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">doing that because I&#39;m going to meet him</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.860" end="00:25:21.470" style="s2">three times in the next few months so</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">that the the yin-yang idea the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.470" end="00:25:25.190" style="s2">order idea is metaphorical in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:26.930" style="s2">to say that the world is made up of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.190" end="00:25:29.290" style="s2">order and chaos doesn&#39;t sound like an</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.930" end="00:25:32.210" style="s2">empirical statement but strangely enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.290" end="00:25:35.090" style="s2">the world to which our brains are</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:36.530" style="s2">adapted is actually the world of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.090" end="00:25:38.360" style="s2">and order you can think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.530" end="00:25:40.100" style="s2">unexplored and explored territory too</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.360" end="00:25:43.670" style="s2">that&#39;s another that&#39;s another you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.100" end="00:25:45.350" style="s2">take on it and so then you think from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.670" end="00:25:47.450" style="s2">Darwinian perspective think about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.350" end="00:25:50.410" style="s2">this way from a Darwinian perspective</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.450" end="00:25:53.300" style="s2">there&#39;s an there&#39;s an an axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.410" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">presupposition and that is reality is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.300" end="00:25:58.190" style="s2">that which selects okay reality is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:01.310" style="s2">force that selects over evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.190" end="00:26:03.140" style="s2">time and so the force that selects over</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.310" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">evolutionary time has selected for</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.140" end="00:26:07.460" style="s2">hemispheric specialization bilateral</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:09.110" style="s2">hemispheric specialization which</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.460" end="00:26:11.180" style="s2">indicates the two different modes of</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.180" end="00:26:16.220" style="s2">survival right so that&#39;s real and so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.420" end="00:26:18.620" style="s2">idea that the world is made out of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.220" end="00:26:20.900" style="s2">and order is perhaps the most real idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.620" end="00:26:22.940" style="s2">now here&#39;s something else cool that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.900" end="00:26:25.430" style="s2">associated with that and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:28.630" style="s2">antidote to nihilism I also think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.430" end="00:26:32.380" style="s2">an antidote to - what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.630" end="00:26:35.390" style="s2">ideological ideological possession so</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.380" end="00:26:36.770" style="s2">when you encounter something unknown you</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.390" end="00:26:38.510" style="s2">orient towards it and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.770" end="00:26:39.770" style="s2">involuntary response you could even</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.510" end="00:26:41.610" style="s2">think about it as a deterministic</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.770" end="00:26:43.530" style="s2">response it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.610" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">Orient&#39;s you very rapidly towards</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.530" end="00:26:47.220" style="s2">predators so that they don&#39;t kill you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:49.800" style="s2">before you have a chance to respond okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.220" end="00:26:51.210" style="s2">so you react because the anomalous thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.800" end="00:26:53.060" style="s2">is meaningful it&#39;s intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.210" end="00:26:55.560" style="s2">meaningful and the reaction is first</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.060" end="00:26:58.770" style="s2">terror with perhaps an overlay of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.560" end="00:27:01.380" style="s2">disgust and second curiosity and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.770" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">terror so that you freeze and remain</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.380" end="00:27:05.220" style="s2">paralyzed you turn to stone when you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:05.820" style="s2">look at the basilisk or the snake or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.220" end="00:27:07.380" style="s2">Gorgon</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.820" end="00:27:09.090" style="s2">you turn to stone you&#39;re paralyzed like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.380" end="00:27:11.700" style="s2">a prey animal and that&#39;s so the prey</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.090" end="00:27:13.290" style="s2">predator can&#39;t see you at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.700" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s other elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.290" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">orienting reflex that are associated</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:18.150" style="s2">with predator avoidance and then if</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:20.790" style="s2">nothing additionally terrible happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.150" end="00:27:22.590" style="s2">you start to thaw out and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.790" end="00:27:24.810" style="s2">explore and you do that with image first</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.590" end="00:27:26.520" style="s2">and and then prep and then practice the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.810" end="00:27:28.770" style="s2">appropriate behaviors and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.520" end="00:27:32.550" style="s2">automate those now look here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.770" end="00:27:36.300" style="s2">that&#39;s cool so that orienting reflex to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.550" end="00:27:40.530" style="s2">the unknown is it&#39;s an admixture of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.300" end="00:27:42.570" style="s2">threat fear and curiosity incentive</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.530" end="00:27:45.720" style="s2">rewards so negative emotion and positive</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.570" end="00:27:47.940" style="s2">emotion now and it&#39;s dose dependent the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.720" end="00:27:51.510" style="s2">larger the anomaly which means the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.940" end="00:27:53.400" style="s2">larger the map it blows out when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.510" end="00:27:56.850" style="s2">manifests itself think of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:27:59.220" style="s2">between being irritated at your marital</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.850" end="00:28:01.050" style="s2">partner because they you know oh who</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.220" end="00:28:03.330" style="s2">knows because they relate to pick you up</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.050" end="00:28:04.500" style="s2">for work compared to how irritated you</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.330" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">would be if you found out they were</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.500" end="00:28:07.590" style="s2">having an affair</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:10.470" style="s2">difference in size of anomaly the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.590" end="00:28:13.260" style="s2">one disrupts a tiny little part of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.470" end="00:28:15.360" style="s2">space-time orientation and the second</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.260" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">one demolishes your past present and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.360" end="00:28:21.390" style="s2">future and the larger the disruption the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:23.730" style="s2">more negative emotion obviously and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.390" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">so there&#39;s this weird interplay between</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.730" end="00:28:28.530" style="s2">negative and positive emotion in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:30.300" style="s2">response to anomaly and but it&#39;s deeply</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.530" end="00:28:32.010" style="s2">meaningful even if it&#39;s even if it</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.300" end="00:28:33.900" style="s2">paralyzes you even if it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.010" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s meaningful and then that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.900" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">perhaps into intense curiosity and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">start to explore now the phenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">meaning is a manifestation of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:47.250" style="s2">complex orienting reflex and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.610" end="00:28:50.120" style="s2">wired so that you&#39;re not just order and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.250" end="00:28:52.350" style="s2">you&#39;re not just chaos your order</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.120" end="00:28:54.730" style="s2">continually confronting chaos so that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.350" end="00:28:56.260" style="s2">the order remains updated and</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.730" end="00:28:58.360" style="s2">you might say well how do you know how</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.260" end="00:29:00.610" style="s2">much chaos you should confront in order</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.360" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">to keep the order continually updated</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.610" end="00:29:07.240" style="s2">and the answer is meaning see something</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:08.530" style="s2">is meaningful the reason that something</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.240" end="00:29:11.350" style="s2">is meaningful is because you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.530" end="00:29:13.780" style="s2">a deep instinctual signal that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.350" end="00:29:16.059" style="s2">encountering normally at a rate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.780" end="00:29:17.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exceed your capability that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.059" end="00:29:20.590" style="s2">also the rate at which you can keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.650" end="00:29:22.929" style="s2">yourself updated optimally and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.590" end="00:29:25.360" style="s2">meaning isn&#39;t epic phenomenal and it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.929" end="00:29:27.400" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t some kind of delusion</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.360" end="00:29:29.320" style="s2">that rationality can and should overcome</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.400" end="00:29:31.150" style="s2">to say well everything&#39;s meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.320" end="00:29:33.100" style="s2">it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not meaning is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.150" end="00:29:35.590" style="s2">most fundamental instinct for adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.100" end="00:29:38.140" style="s2">and so that&#39;s partly why in 12 rules for</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.590" end="00:29:41.230" style="s2">life I said one of the rules I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.140" end="00:29:43.750" style="s2">it&#39;s rule 7 is do what is meaningful not</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.230" end="00:29:45.250" style="s2">what is expedient because meaning is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.750" end="00:29:47.620" style="s2">really good guide to long term</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.250" end="00:29:49.750" style="s2">adaptation and so then and the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.620" end="00:29:51.100" style="s2">thing about meaning which is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.750" end="00:29:53.140" style="s2">happens when you get the balance between</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.100" end="00:29:57.220" style="s2">chaos and order right is that meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.140" end="00:29:59.200" style="s2">the antidote to despair and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.220" end="00:30:01.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s all sorts of reasons in life</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.200" end="00:30:03.370" style="s2">to be desperate and so if you immerse</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.480" end="00:30:05.020" style="s2">yourself in meaning you can learn to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.370" end="00:30:07.179" style="s2">that you can learn to do that you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.020" end="00:30:09.010" style="s2">make that goal your highest goal and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.179" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">then the highest goal would be to be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.010" end="00:30:15.549" style="s2">sort of mythological hero let&#39;s say to</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:17.590" style="s2">embody and incarnate and imitate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.549" end="00:30:19.570" style="s2">mythological hero like the imitation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.590" end="00:30:22.150" style="s2">Christ which is what you&#39;re called to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.570" end="00:30:23.650" style="s2">if you happen to be Christian that means</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.150" end="00:30:25.630" style="s2">that you live in meaning and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.650" end="00:30:27.130" style="s2">meaning is the antidote to the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.630" end="00:30:29.590" style="s2">of life that would otherwise make you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.130" end="00:30:32.049" style="s2">brutal and vengeful and unhappy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.590" end="00:30:34.900" style="s2">miserable and like that that young guy</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.049" end="00:30:37.780" style="s2">who just mowed down 12 people in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.900" end="00:30:39.549" style="s2">these are real things you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.780" end="00:30:41.830" style="s2">sense of meaning you end up in hell and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.549" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">in hell you do all sorts of terrible</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.830" end="00:30:47.020" style="s2">things these are these are dreadful</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:50.340" style="s2">realities and it isn&#39;t as if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.020" end="00:30:53.049" style="s2">grounded in the appropriate science so</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.340" end="00:30:56.350" style="s2">anyways that was also a very complicated</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.820" end="00:31:09.400" style="s2">I think the Devils in the details to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.780" end="00:31:11.080" style="s2">tell you the truth when if I was ever</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.400" end="00:31:12.610" style="s2">talking to any individuals about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.080" end="00:31:14.560" style="s2">that&#39;s it the question is well how would</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.610" end="00:31:17.530" style="s2">you raise them I mean you have problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.560" end="00:31:19.270" style="s2">right if you&#39;re both of the same sex</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.530" end="00:31:21.730" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to have the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.270" end="00:31:23.970" style="s2">how to provide the proper model for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.730" end="00:31:27.490" style="s2">know let&#39;s say you have a boy and a girl</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.970" end="00:31:28.660" style="s2">you we know this is indisputable and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.490" end="00:31:31.000" style="s2">this is something I&#39;ve talked to Warren</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.660" end="00:31:32.890" style="s2">Farrell about kids in intact</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.000" end="00:31:36.400" style="s2">heterosexual families where the father</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.890" end="00:31:39.610" style="s2">is present do way better on multiple</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.400" end="00:31:41.950" style="s2">indices than kids who are are part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.610" end="00:31:43.570" style="s2">single-parent families now that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.950" end="00:31:45.880" style="s2">mean that there are no single parents</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:47.740" style="s2">who do a good job right that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.880" end="00:31:51.730" style="s2">same bloody claim those are different</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.740" end="00:31:53.560" style="s2">claims but on average kid not only do</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.730" end="00:31:56.950" style="s2">kids where father&#39;s are present do</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.560" end="00:31:59.170" style="s2">better but societies or even even local</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.950" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">societies where there are more fathers</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.170" end="00:32:04.060" style="s2">present do better not only for the kids</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:06.100" style="s2">that they&#39;re fathering but the kids in</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.060" end="00:32:08.950" style="s2">the neighborhood whether lots of intact</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.100" end="00:32:11.560" style="s2">families with fathers do better and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.950" end="00:32:15.570" style="s2">believe quite firmly that the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.560" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">family is the smallest viable human unit</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.570" end="00:32:21.820" style="s2">father mother child smallest viable unit</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:25.000" style="s2">and if you fragment it below that then</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.820" end="00:32:26.740" style="s2">you end up paying now that that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.000" end="00:32:29.800" style="s2">mean that there are wait there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.740" end="00:32:32.590" style="s2">ways that you can operate in the smaller</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.800" end="00:32:34.570" style="s2">unit or a different unit effectively but</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.590" end="00:32:38.530" style="s2">you have to contend with the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.570" end="00:32:41.230" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary for people for kids to</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.530" end="00:32:43.030" style="s2">have models for both sexes and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.230" end="00:32:44.530" style="s2">means that means accepting that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.030" end="00:32:46.180" style="s2">sexes are different even though there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.530" end="00:32:47.970" style="s2">a fair overlap between them accepting</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.180" end="00:32:50.950" style="s2">that they&#39;re different and that both</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">sexes play their role it looks like what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:53.890" style="s2">father&#39;s do and I talked to Warren</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:56.560" style="s2">Farrell a lot about this and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.890" end="00:32:58.120" style="s2">to release this video this month about</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.560" end="00:33:00.940" style="s2">what father&#39;s do and a lot of what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.120" end="00:33:02.680" style="s2">do is rough-and-tumble play with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.940" end="00:33:05.140" style="s2">kids which kids really really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.680" end="00:33:06.730" style="s2">like and it&#39;s really important as young</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.140" end="00:33:08.470" style="s2">panksepp a great effective</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.730" end="00:33:09.880" style="s2">neuroscientist laid out in his studies</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.470" end="00:33:12.730" style="s2">on routes he discovered the play</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.880" end="00:33:13.810" style="s2">circuitry and fathers this is something</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.730" end="00:33:15.250" style="s2">Farrell told me which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.810" end="00:33:16.210" style="s2">extraordinarily interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.250" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">fathers used</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.210" end="00:33:22.090" style="s2">joy of the possibility of play as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:24.160" style="s2">scaffold to help children learn to delay</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.090" end="00:33:25.420" style="s2">gratification so imagine a father spends</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.160" end="00:33:26.530" style="s2">a bunch of time playing with his kids</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.420" end="00:33:28.330" style="s2">and they&#39;re having a great old time</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.530" end="00:33:30.160" style="s2">they&#39;re wrestling around and pushing</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.330" end="00:33:32.050" style="s2">each other&#39;s limits to find out where</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.160" end="00:33:34.450" style="s2">they are and and learning the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.050" end="00:33:37.150" style="s2">physiological dance that goes along with</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.450" end="00:33:38.950" style="s2">direct contact direct exciting contact</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.150" end="00:33:40.900" style="s2">learning what hurts and what doesn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.950" end="00:33:42.700" style="s2">what constitutes fair play and what</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.900" end="00:33:44.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t and how everybody can play and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.700" end="00:33:46.330" style="s2">still enjoy the game and how excited you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.500" end="00:33:47.860" style="s2">could get before it&#39;s too much and how</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.330" end="00:33:49.390" style="s2">much you should whine and how much you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.860" end="00:33:51.190" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t and when you can object to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.390" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">being hurt all of that had a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.190" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">embodied level the kids love that</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:57.610" style="s2">they&#39;ll line up for that and panksepp</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:34:00.580" style="s2">demonstrated very clearly that rats will</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.610" end="00:34:02.170" style="s2">work to play and that routes play fair</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.580" end="00:34:04.900" style="s2">and they learn to play fair because of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.170" end="00:34:07.390" style="s2">iterated play bouts and that if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.900" end="00:34:09.190" style="s2">don&#39;t let juvenile male rats play then</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.390" end="00:34:11.080" style="s2">their prefrontal cortexes don&#39;t develop</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.190" end="00:34:13.060" style="s2">and they get attention deficit disorder</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.080" end="00:34:15.970" style="s2">or the equivalent in rats and then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.060" end="00:34:18.550" style="s2">can treat that with ritalin and so this</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.970" end="00:34:21.760" style="s2">is all very vital material now if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.550" end="00:34:23.920" style="s2">going to if you if you&#39;re gay let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.760" end="00:34:25.390" style="s2">there&#39;s two two men or two women then</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.920" end="00:34:29.950" style="s2">you have the problem of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.390" end="00:34:31.360" style="s2">going to do for the Contra sexual target</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.950" end="00:34:32.650" style="s2">and you can say well it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.360" end="00:34:34.630" style="s2">because there&#39;s no differences between</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.650" end="00:34:36.400" style="s2">men and women and you can gerrymander</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.630" end="00:34:38.620" style="s2">the damn question that way and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.400" end="00:34:40.210" style="s2">your amoral responsibility or you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.620" end="00:34:42.760" style="s2">face it squarely and say look you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.210" end="00:34:44.440" style="s2">decided to step outside of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.760" end="00:34:46.360" style="s2">norm and to organize a non-standard</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.440" end="00:34:48.970" style="s2">relationship which puts a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.360" end="00:34:50.530" style="s2">responsibility on you and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.970" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">to figure out how you can provide for</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.530" end="00:34:55.810" style="s2">your children what it is that they would</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:57.790" style="s2">get in the classic minimal human unit so</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.810" end="00:34:59.500" style="s2">and more power to you I hope you can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.790" end="00:35:01.600" style="s2">a good job of it you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:04.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a room in the world for for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.600" end="00:35:07.240" style="s2">diverse range of approaches to complex</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.990" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">life problems like like having kids and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.240" end="00:35:10.780" style="s2">finding a partner but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:13.240" style="s2">you get to bury your head in the sand</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.780" end="00:35:14.260" style="s2">about the absolute realities of life and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.240" end="00:35:16.300" style="s2">the fact that there are biological</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.260" end="00:35:18.910" style="s2">differences between men and women to</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.300" end="00:35:21.730" style="s2">deny that is is reprehensible in my</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.910" end="00:35:23.560" style="s2">estimation and besides the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.730" end="00:35:27.820" style="s2">data the scientific data are crystal</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.560" end="00:35:30.370" style="s2">clear so in it so ok</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.820" end="00:35:32.410" style="s2">call Youm says that everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.370" end="00:35:33.760" style="s2">unconscious is projected into reality</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.410" end="00:35:35.770" style="s2">how do you know if you are perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.760" end="00:35:38.140" style="s2">reality accurately or are just</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.770" end="00:35:40.180" style="s2">projecting great yeah well that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.140" end="00:35:43.060" style="s2">why I&#39;m a pragmatist well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.180" end="00:35:47.800" style="s2">bunch of ways there&#39;s a bunch of ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.060" end="00:35:49.270" style="s2">that you know pain tells you if you make</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.800" end="00:35:50.950" style="s2">a mistake and you hurt yourself well</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.270" end="00:35:52.870" style="s2">then your stupid theory was wrong right</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.950" end="00:35:54.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what the pain says your stupid</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.870" end="00:35:57.400" style="s2">theory was wrong and that&#39;s a pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.910" end="00:35:59.590" style="s2">you see that&#39;s another indication of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.400" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">pragmatic theory of truth you lay out</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.590" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">look when you look at the world you look</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:05.380" style="s2">at the world with a set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:07.750" style="s2">presuppositions outlined that in Chapter</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.380" end="00:36:10.210" style="s2">ten in in rules and twelve rules for</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.750" end="00:36:12.820" style="s2">life called be precise in your speech it</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.210" end="00:36:14.500" style="s2">indicates that when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.820" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">world you look at it through a value</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.500" end="00:36:17.560" style="s2">structure you can&#39;t help that because</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:18.580" style="s2">you&#39;re always aiming of something in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.560" end="00:36:20.140" style="s2">world and you&#39;re always aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.580" end="00:36:21.910" style="s2">something you want and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.140" end="00:36:23.470" style="s2">get it and so that means that you look</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.910" end="00:36:25.510" style="s2">at the world through a value structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.470" end="00:36:27.820" style="s2">now the question is whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.510" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">value structure is valid and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.820" end="00:36:32.080" style="s2">very complicated question okay so how do</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.360" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s valid number one you</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.080" end="00:36:36.310" style="s2">lay it out and you act it out</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.360" end="00:36:38.320" style="s2">you you implement it perceptually and</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.310" end="00:36:40.600" style="s2">then you act it out and if you get what</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.320" end="00:36:41.830" style="s2">you wanted what the theory predicted</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.600" end="00:36:43.180" style="s2">that&#39;s another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.830" end="00:36:45.580" style="s2">but want it is a better way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.180" end="00:36:47.530" style="s2">about it then the fact that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.580" end="00:36:49.600" style="s2">behavioral routine and perceptual</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.780" end="00:36:59.110" style="s2">now it might be the only form of truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:00.970" style="s2">although I&#39;m not convinced of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.110" end="00:37:03.220" style="s2">completely but it might be it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.970" end="00:37:05.710" style="s2">complicated question now how do you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.220" end="00:37:09.250" style="s2">if your stupid theory is wrong okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.710" end="00:37:11.770" style="s2">a it fails and you&#39;re hurt pain tells</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.250" end="00:37:13.480" style="s2">you you pragmatically your theory was</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.770" end="00:37:15.160" style="s2">wrong so that&#39;s why you should pay</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.480" end="00:37:16.780" style="s2">attention to your own pain because your</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.160" end="00:37:18.520" style="s2">suffering is indication that you still</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.780" end="00:37:20.820" style="s2">have things to learn and maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.520" end="00:37:23.110" style="s2">suffering of other people is also that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.820" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">maybe something unexpected or</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.110" end="00:37:26.860" style="s2">unpredictable happens when you&#39;re laying</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:29.230" style="s2">out your plan and then the anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.860" end="00:37:31.900" style="s2">manifests itself the unexpected or chaos</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.230" end="00:37:33.850" style="s2">and then you get anxious while anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.900" end="00:37:35.980" style="s2">is an indication that your plan your</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.850" end="00:37:38.500" style="s2">arrow didn&#39;t fly to its mark so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.980" end="00:37:41.350" style="s2">aimed wrong and that might mean a small</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.500" end="00:37:41.650" style="s2">error you know maybe a tiny adjustment</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.350" end="00:37:43.420" style="s2">of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.650" end="00:37:44.710" style="s2">board might mean you just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.420" end="00:37:45.789" style="s2">what the hell you&#39;re doing at all and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.710" end="00:37:48.759" style="s2">everything is lost</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.789" end="00:37:52.269" style="s2">and so anxiety tells you if your theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.759" end="00:37:53.710" style="s2">is wrong and then and then other people</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.269" end="00:37:54.990" style="s2">tell you that and that&#39;s why you want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.710" end="00:37:58.289" style="s2">surround yourself with other people</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.990" end="00:38:03.249" style="s2">because you distribute your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.289" end="00:38:05.829" style="s2">resort you you you distribute your</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.249" end="00:38:07.509" style="s2">problems to the cognitive resources of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.829" end="00:38:09.519" style="s2">the social group that&#39;s what we do when</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.509" end="00:38:10.930" style="s2">we price things right everyone votes on</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.519" end="00:38:12.670" style="s2">the price of something because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.930" end="00:38:14.499" style="s2">difficult because the price of something</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.670" end="00:38:16.509" style="s2">has to be established in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.499" end="00:38:18.599" style="s2">the price of everything else and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.509" end="00:38:21.069" style="s2">always in flux and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.599" end="00:38:23.740" style="s2">computationally impossible problem and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.069" end="00:38:25.839" style="s2">so we outsource it to the market which</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.740" end="00:38:27.880" style="s2">is the free cognitive decision of</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.839" end="00:38:30.009" style="s2">millions of people and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.880" end="00:38:31.990" style="s2">determine price and so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.009" end="00:38:33.789" style="s2">you do to make sure that you&#39;re not any</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.990" end="00:38:36.369" style="s2">stupider than you have to be blind</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.789" end="00:38:38.049" style="s2">ignorant biased and all of that is you</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.369" end="00:38:39.609" style="s2">surround yourself with other people and</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.049" end="00:38:41.259" style="s2">you try to treat them well enough so</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.609" end="00:38:42.849" style="s2">that they can tolerate you and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.259" end="00:38:45.369" style="s2">every time that you do something stupid</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.849" end="00:38:47.499" style="s2">because one of your theories is it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.369" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">vague or incomplete or wrong or biased</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.499" end="00:38:51.369" style="s2">or you&#39;re willfully blind then they slap</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:53.019" style="s2">you on the side of the head they ignore</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.369" end="00:38:54.249" style="s2">you because you&#39;re boring they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.019" end="00:38:57.609" style="s2">laugh at your jokes because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.249" end="00:38:59.499" style="s2">stupid they they they are irritated at</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.609" end="00:39:01.299" style="s2">your actions because you&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.499" end="00:39:02.499" style="s2">your own long-term interests or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.299" end="00:39:06.190" style="s2">interests of other people into account</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.499" end="00:39:09.190" style="s2">and so you have pain you have anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.190" end="00:39:11.019" style="s2">you have the reward of success that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.190" end="00:39:12.759" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a positive indicator that</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.019" end="00:39:15.480" style="s2">your Theory&#39;s okay and then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.759" end="00:39:17.799" style="s2">reactions of everyone else and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.480" end="00:39:19.989" style="s2">clued in you pay attention to all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.799" end="00:39:23.559" style="s2">those things and you try to update your</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.989" end="00:39:25.210" style="s2">your order which is your perceptions you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.559" end="00:39:27.460" style="s2">try to update your order constantly as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.210" end="00:39:29.529" style="s2">consequence of being humble in the face</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.460" end="00:39:31.150" style="s2">of your errors which is why humility is</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.529" end="00:39:33.670" style="s2">the precondition to for learning and why</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.150" end="00:39:38.109" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the highest moral virtues so</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.670" end="00:39:40.989" style="s2">and perceiving reality accurately you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.109" end="00:39:42.730" style="s2">don&#39;t really perceive reality and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.989" end="00:39:45.400" style="s2">don&#39;t really perceive accurately you</p>

<p begin="00:39:47.440" end="00:39:52.210" style="s2">time and accurately means well enough so</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.890" end="00:39:54.999" style="s2">that when you do what you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.210" end="00:39:55.210" style="s2">works that&#39;s why I&#39;m a pragmatist I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.999" end="00:39:57.099" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.210" end="00:39:59.619" style="s2">only I mean you know I mean there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.099" end="00:40:01.390" style="s2">of other philosophical streams that have</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.619" end="00:40:03.460" style="s2">influenced my thought existentialism</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.460" end="00:40:09.640" style="s2">to others but the thing is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.690" end="00:40:11.230" style="s2">perceive reality accurately because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.640" end="00:40:13.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know everything so and you&#39;re full</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.230" end="00:40:14.950" style="s2">of biases and and you&#39;re ignorant as</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.180" end="00:40:16.810" style="s2">hell and so the best you can do is</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.950" end="00:40:18.250" style="s2">perceive small bits of reality well</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.810" end="00:40:20.290" style="s2">enough so that you can more or less get</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.250" end="00:40:21.849" style="s2">what you need in a relatively short</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.290" end="00:40:23.859" style="s2">period of time without screwing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.849" end="00:40:26.140" style="s2">up too badly in the medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.859" end="00:40:27.880" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much what you&#39;ve got and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.140" end="00:40:30.160" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean truth is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.880" end="00:40:32.260" style="s2">impossible it just means that it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.160" end="00:40:34.690" style="s2">very complicated to decide what truth is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.260" end="00:40:36.220" style="s2">and because the question is what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.690" end="00:40:39.670" style="s2">truth for someone whose knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.220" end="00:40:40.990" style="s2">limited right because obviously because</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.670" end="00:40:43.660" style="s2">your knowledge is limited and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.990" end="00:40:45.880" style="s2">know everything saying some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.660" end="00:40:47.589" style="s2">way you&#39;re ignorant or wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.880" end="00:40:49.240" style="s2">everything but that doesn&#39;t help because</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.589" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">you still have to act in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.240" end="00:40:56.470" style="s2">there are bounded truths they&#39;re bounded</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:59.310" style="s2">truths and so all right if past</p>

<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.550" style="s2">minutes and see if you&#39;re less anxious</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.480" end="00:42:20.050" style="s2">and try it out for like two weeks every</p>

<p begin="00:42:27.970" end="00:42:33.790" style="s2">irritable and foggy and you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.040" end="00:42:35.260" style="s2">and so and the best way to treat that as</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.790" end="00:42:36.670" style="s2">far as I&#39;ve been able to tell and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.260" end="00:42:38.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a decent literature on this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.670" end="00:42:39.910" style="s2">to make sure that you eat a big</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.170" end="00:42:41.170" style="s2">breakfast and you might say well I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.910" end="00:42:43.210" style="s2">hungry in the morning it&#39;s like who the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.170" end="00:42:45.700" style="s2">hell cares if you&#39;re hungry I didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.210" end="00:42:48.040" style="s2">enjoy your breakfast I said eat it</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.700" end="00:42:49.630" style="s2">that&#39;s not the same thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.040" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of things that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.630" end="00:42:52.540" style="s2">do that you don&#39;t enjoy to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:54.609" style="s2">you&#39;ll get hungry in six months and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.540" end="00:42:56.619" style="s2">you&#39;ll start to enjoy it so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.609" end="00:42:59.500" style="s2">massive difference I take small naps</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.619" end="00:43:01.150" style="s2">quite frequently if I&#39;m wiped out you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.500" end="00:43:03.700" style="s2">know I&#39;ll go have a nap for ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.150" end="00:43:08.890" style="s2">or 15 minutes and then that helps quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.700" end="00:43:10.599" style="s2">a lot I try to wake up fairly regular a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.890" end="00:43:11.710" style="s2">lot on a fairly regular schedule that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.599" end="00:43:13.869" style="s2">another thing I would really recommend</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.710" end="00:43:16.750" style="s2">for people whose lives are in disarray</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.869" end="00:43:18.940" style="s2">and who are anxious try to fix your wake</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.750" end="00:43:19.990" style="s2">time sleep going when you sleep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.940" end="00:43:22.000" style="s2">not so important</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.990" end="00:43:23.950" style="s2">so you can still you know stay up late</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.000" end="00:43:28.930" style="s2">and have fun and all that but getting up</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.950" end="00:43:30.430" style="s2">in the morning is really helpful so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.930" end="00:43:33.010" style="s2">know and you you also have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.430" end="00:43:35.920" style="s2">how much you can work or write I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.010" end="00:43:37.780" style="s2">write for more than about max my</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.920" end="00:43:40.030" style="s2">sustainable maximum for writing is three</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.780" end="00:43:43.540" style="s2">hours a day and if I push it past that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.030" end="00:43:45.069" style="s2">then especially if I&#39;m editing I I make</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.540" end="00:43:47.290" style="s2">mistakes when I&#39;m editing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.069" end="00:43:50.230" style="s2">counterproductive and I can&#39;t sustain it</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.290" end="00:43:51.849" style="s2">across time and so I don&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.230" end="00:43:54.339" style="s2">you can do more than about three hours</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.849" end="00:43:56.560" style="s2">of extremely intense intellectual work a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.339" end="00:43:58.930" style="s2">day although if you have a nap you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.560" end="00:44:00.339" style="s2">stretch that but I think at least I end</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.930" end="00:44:05.290" style="s2">up paying for it across time</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.339" end="00:44:06.700" style="s2">so nap make sure you eat and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.290" end="00:44:08.470" style="s2">you eat protein and fat and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.700" end="00:44:14.260" style="s2">carbohydrates because carbohydrates are</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.470" end="00:44:15.670" style="s2">basically poisonous that&#39;s about that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.260" end="00:44:18.670" style="s2">about and make sure that you get enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.670" end="00:44:20.650" style="s2">sleep so that&#39;s that&#39;s how I combat it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.670" end="00:44:22.359" style="s2">and try to make myself hyper efficient</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.650" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">which is also a really interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.359" end="00:44:25.519" style="s2">to try</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:28.069" style="s2">you know I was talking to my agents at</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.519" end="00:44:30.079" style="s2">CAA Creative Artists Agency in LA and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.069" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">just hired a publicist to to help me</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.079" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">manage media in a more intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.869" style="s2">manner and we&#39;re trying to think about</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:38.750" style="s2">our overarching philosophy you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.869" end="00:44:40.700" style="s2">I first proposed to the CAA guys that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.750" end="00:44:42.170" style="s2">our overarching philosophy would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.700" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">something like because you need an</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.170" end="00:44:46.460" style="s2">overarching philosophy under which you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:48.920" style="s2">nest all your specific actions it was</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.460" end="00:44:50.569" style="s2">something like to educate as many people</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.920" end="00:44:52.339" style="s2">as possible in the shortest period of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.569" end="00:44:54.559" style="s2">time which seems like a really good goal</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.339" end="00:44:56.000" style="s2">like why the hell not do that but then</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.559" end="00:44:57.740" style="s2">we broadened out a little bit this week</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:45:00.380" style="s2">which was to try to do as much good</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.740" end="00:45:02.420" style="s2">possible as efficiently as possible and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.380" end="00:45:04.220" style="s2">that efficiency thing is really fun if</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.420" end="00:45:06.140" style="s2">you guys who are listening are out for a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.220" end="00:45:07.640" style="s2">challenge like one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.140" end="00:45:09.230" style="s2">you can I think this heightens the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.640" end="00:45:11.000" style="s2">meaning in your life is to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.230" end="00:45:13.430" style="s2">difficult things right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.000" end="00:45:15.619" style="s2">aim high note names so damn high you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.430" end="00:45:18.170" style="s2">can&#39;t manage it and make sure you break</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.619" end="00:45:20.059" style="s2">down your aims into reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.170" end="00:45:21.799" style="s2">attainable sub goals but you want to aim</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.059" end="00:45:23.720" style="s2">high and then you want to see how hyper</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.799" end="00:45:26.150" style="s2">efficient you can get that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.720" end="00:45:28.640" style="s2">thing to do in your early 20s is to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.150" end="00:45:30.529" style="s2">okay like discipline yourself you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.829" style="s2">okay how much work can I do if I load</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.529" end="00:45:35.900" style="s2">myself right to the maximum how far do I</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.829" end="00:45:38.779" style="s2">how far can I work how hard can I work</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.900" end="00:45:41.180" style="s2">until I exhaust myself and then you back</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.779" end="00:45:43.730" style="s2">off obviously because the optimal amount</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.180" end="00:45:46.519" style="s2">of working productive engagement let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.730" end="00:45:48.410" style="s2">say is that which is sustainable across</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.519" end="00:45:50.029" style="s2">decades so you have to you have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.410" end="00:45:51.619" style="s2">that but you don&#39;t learn that without</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.029" end="00:45:53.480" style="s2">stretching yourself to your limits to</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.619" end="00:45:55.309" style="s2">begin with and you know if your life</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.480" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t everything it could be and if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.309" end="00:45:58.549" style="s2">you&#39;re suffering from an excess of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.619" style="s2">meaninglessness well it means you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.549" end="00:46:02.119" style="s2">oriented in the world of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.619" end="00:46:05.180" style="s2">properly it&#39;s like you could learn to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.119" end="00:46:06.769" style="s2">discipline yourself look figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.180" end="00:46:08.390" style="s2">figure out what it is that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.769" end="00:46:10.369" style="s2">do and that you want to do and then see</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.390" end="00:46:11.960" style="s2">how efficient you can get because one of</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.369" end="00:46:14.029" style="s2">the things that&#39;s quite fun is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.960" end="00:46:15.500" style="s2">out if you have a task I always tell my</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.029" end="00:46:18.049" style="s2">graduate students this if they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.500" end="00:46:19.910" style="s2">an experiment - if you have a task that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.049" end="00:46:22.759" style="s2">you have to do it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.910" end="00:46:24.859" style="s2">to spend a few minutes sometimes hours</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.759" end="00:46:26.269" style="s2">depending on how long the task is see if</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.859" end="00:46:29.150" style="s2">you can figure out how to do it from</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.269" end="00:46:30.380" style="s2">from five to 10 times faster it means</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.150" end="00:46:32.029" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to rearrange the way you</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.380" end="00:46:33.619" style="s2">think about it but you can often do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.029" end="00:46:35.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s how extremely productive</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.619" end="00:46:36.559" style="s2">people get so hyper efficient you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.720" end="00:46:38.180" style="s2">sometimes it means the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.559" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">to delegate it means sometimes it means</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.180" end="00:46:42.559" style="s2">you have to bring other people aboard</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:44.509" style="s2">that&#39;s delegation as well as suppose but</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.559" end="00:46:46.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of preconceptions that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.509" end="00:46:48.049" style="s2">hold about who you are and who the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.549" end="00:46:49.729" style="s2">is that you could dispense with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.049" end="00:46:53.089" style="s2">would make you a way more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.729" end="00:46:56.599" style="s2">actor in the world and so alright so</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.089" end="00:46:58.130" style="s2">there that&#39;s that if past experiences</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.599" end="00:46:59.630" style="s2">shape us from the moment of birth how</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.130" end="00:47:01.549" style="s2">can an action be ever said to be the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.630" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">result of free will rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.549" end="00:47:05.420" style="s2">accumulation of past influences well it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.130" style="s2">is in large part the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.420" end="00:47:08.900" style="s2">past influences because that&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.130" end="00:47:10.459" style="s2">but I address that I would say already</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.900" end="00:47:12.259" style="s2">pretty thoroughly in my discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.459" end="00:47:14.209" style="s2">free will your your free will isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.259" end="00:47:16.430" style="s2">absolute I mean what are you a genie</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.209" end="00:47:19.069" style="s2">even a genie is constrained inside a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.430" end="00:47:20.630" style="s2">lamp you know so there&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.069" end="00:47:23.479" style="s2">action without constraint there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.630" end="00:47:25.459" style="s2">action without limitation so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.479" end="00:47:27.829" style="s2">it&#39;s just not conceptualized well and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.459" end="00:47:29.269" style="s2">all of your choices are constrained not</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.829" end="00:47:32.809" style="s2">least by the fact that you have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.269" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">yourself lives so even just because</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.809" end="00:47:36.559" style="s2">there are limitations that emerge say as</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.239" style="s2">a consequence of the accumulation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.559" end="00:47:39.890" style="s2">past influences doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.239" end="00:47:44.089" style="s2">aren&#39;t that you don&#39;t still have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.890" end="00:47:46.670" style="s2">massive domain of freedom so what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.089" end="00:47:48.589" style="s2">your opinion of attachment based therapy</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.670" end="00:47:50.239" style="s2">and do you think that therapy is at risk</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.589" end="00:47:52.219" style="s2">of encouraging people to wallow in</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.239" end="00:47:53.959" style="s2">self-pity I&#39;m not going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.219" end="00:47:55.309" style="s2">attachment based therapy because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.959" end="00:47:57.109" style="s2">know enough about it to provide an</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.309" end="00:47:59.029" style="s2">intelligent critique but I can answer</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.109" end="00:48:00.859" style="s2">the second part of the question do I</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.029" end="00:48:02.660" style="s2">think that therapy risks encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.859" end="00:48:05.109" style="s2">people to wallow in self-pity not if</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.660" end="00:48:07.640" style="s2">it&#39;s done by a competent therapist if</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.109" end="00:48:09.439" style="s2">you&#39;re a therapist is encouraging you to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.640" end="00:48:10.910" style="s2">wallow in self-pity then it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.439" end="00:48:12.140" style="s2">get the hell out of there you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.910" end="00:48:13.699" style="s2">therapist who thinks that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.140" end="00:48:16.939" style="s2">supposed to offer you a safe space</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.699" end="00:48:20.689" style="s2">that&#39;s not helpful look what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.939" end="00:48:22.579" style="s2">as a therapist you act as a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.689" end="00:48:24.650" style="s2">counselor so let&#39;s imagine someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.579" end="00:48:28.189" style="s2">to see me so there&#39;s two big mysteries</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.650" end="00:48:30.949" style="s2">right what&#39;s wrong and what what would</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.189" end="00:48:32.989" style="s2">look better what&#39;s wrong and how what</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.949" end="00:48:35.089" style="s2">would a cure look like and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.989" end="00:48:36.439" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re a therapist the first</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.089" end="00:48:37.759" style="s2">thing you want to do is figure out that</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.439" end="00:48:39.739" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with this</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.759" end="00:48:41.449" style="s2">person and probably neither do they and</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.739" end="00:48:43.130" style="s2">you also don&#39;t know what&#39;s right for</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.449" end="00:48:44.449" style="s2">them and so then you start talking to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.130" end="00:48:46.069" style="s2">the person to try to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.449" end="00:48:47.630" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay you&#39;ve come to see me</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.069" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">because something isn&#39;t right in your</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.630" end="00:48:51.770" style="s2">life what is it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.180" style="s2">and so then the person has to talk and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.770" end="00:48:55.130" style="s2">talk and talk and you have to ask them</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.180" end="00:48:56.660" style="s2">questions to find out because you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.130" end="00:48:58.220" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re depressed maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.660" end="00:49:00.680" style="s2">anxious maybe they came from a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.220" end="00:49:02.240" style="s2">family maybe they&#39;re really hard on</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.680" end="00:49:04.400" style="s2">themselves and things are actually going</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:05.690" style="s2">better than they think like you have no</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.400" end="00:49:07.880" style="s2">idea what&#39;s wrong with them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.690" end="00:49:10.280" style="s2">ignorant you&#39;re ignorant and so are they</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.880" end="00:49:12.230" style="s2">and so you say look you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.280" end="00:49:13.460" style="s2">anything as long try to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.230" end="00:49:14.660" style="s2">because otherwise we&#39;re just not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.460" end="00:49:16.910" style="s2">get anywhere because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.660" end="00:49:19.850" style="s2">deal with reality here so tell me the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.910" end="00:49:21.890" style="s2">truth I&#39;m not gonna be judgmental in any</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.850" end="00:49:24.020" style="s2">stupid sense I&#39;m gonna judge like mad</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.890" end="00:49:25.670" style="s2">cuz I want to help you do things right</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.020" end="00:49:26.990" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna be I&#39;m gonna be judging</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.670" end="00:49:29.180" style="s2">like mad but I&#39;m not gonna throw you out</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.990" end="00:49:31.070" style="s2">because of the things you say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.180" end="00:49:33.320" style="s2">gonna have to wander all over weird</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.070" end="00:49:34.340" style="s2">territory to explain your problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.320" end="00:49:36.890" style="s2">because you don&#39;t even know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.340" end="00:49:38.119" style="s2">so you have to listen a lot the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.890" end="00:49:40.310" style="s2">thing you want to figure out is okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.119" end="00:49:42.619" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong here and the person will</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.310" end="00:49:44.600" style="s2">tell you a hundred things that might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.619" end="00:49:46.430" style="s2">wrong and that there&#39;s quite painful to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.600" end="00:49:47.869" style="s2">listen to often you know they&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.430" end="00:49:50.600" style="s2">you about their past and their present I</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.869" end="00:49:53.450" style="s2">don&#39;t mean painful in that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.600" end="00:49:55.670" style="s2">engaging or that it&#39;s not worthwhile I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.450" end="00:49:57.320" style="s2">mean people&#39;s lives have a lot of pain</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.670" end="00:49:59.600" style="s2">in them so it&#39;s painful to partake in</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.320" end="00:50:01.430" style="s2">that so they&#39;ll tell you like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.600" end="00:50:03.290" style="s2">things that might be wrong and then you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.430" end="00:50:05.840" style="s2">do an analysis with them and you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.290" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">well okay how many of those things</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.840" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">really probably aren&#39;t a problem the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:11.690" style="s2">first thing that happens is if you let a</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:14.300" style="s2">person talk about let&#39;s say they tell</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.690" end="00:50:16.040" style="s2">you about a hundred problems the first</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.300" end="00:50:18.260" style="s2">thing you find out is that 90 of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.040" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t real problems and the person just</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.260" end="00:50:21.800" style="s2">figures that out as they talk them</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.150" style="s2">through they say well that&#39;s linked to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.800" end="00:50:24.560" style="s2">this and maybe that&#39;s not really a</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.150" end="00:50:26.270" style="s2">problem that&#39;s not as bad as I thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.560" end="00:50:29.090" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t we can probably ignore that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.270" end="00:50:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like they have a handful of cards</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.090" end="00:50:32.840" style="s2">that aren&#39;t organized and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.880" end="00:50:35.900" style="s2">know what to do with them there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.840" end="00:50:37.609" style="s2">many cards and so you say look lay your</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.900" end="00:50:38.780" style="s2">cards on the table all of them and this</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.609" end="00:50:40.070" style="s2">is also what you do when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.780" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">listening to someone you&#39;re intimate</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.070" end="00:50:42.770" style="s2">with and they&#39;re trying to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.359" end="00:50:44.119" style="s2">problem and you have to be patient to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.770" end="00:50:45.980" style="s2">this because they&#39;re all upset about</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.119" end="00:50:47.600" style="s2">something right and you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.980" end="00:50:49.160" style="s2">it is and maybe they&#39;re upset about you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.600" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">and maybe they&#39;re upset about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.160" end="00:50:52.420" style="s2">and and they&#39;re not handling it very</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:54.710" style="s2">well and they&#39;re impulsive and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.420" end="00:50:56.510" style="s2">volatile and hard on you you say alright</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.710" end="00:50:58.460" style="s2">Christ I&#39;m gonna listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.510" end="00:51:00.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s your stupid problem and</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.460" end="00:51:02.840" style="s2">then they lay out their problem right</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.500" end="00:51:03.330" style="s2">the problem space and you have to listen</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.840" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.330" end="00:51:06.810" style="s2">jump in there too quickly with a damn</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:08.850" style="s2">solution because what the hell do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.810" end="00:51:10.410" style="s2">know so you listen to them lay out the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.850" end="00:51:12.390" style="s2">problem space they lay their cards on</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.410" end="00:51:13.860" style="s2">the table then you say well we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.390" end="00:51:15.360" style="s2">have to pay attention to this we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.860" end="00:51:16.710" style="s2">have to pay attention to this we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.360" end="00:51:18.870" style="s2">have to pay attention to this and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.710" end="00:51:21.060" style="s2">the cutting the dragon of chaos down to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.870" end="00:51:22.850" style="s2">size that&#39;s what it is you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.060" end="00:51:26.580" style="s2">dragon of chaos and it starts to shrink</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.850" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">okay so and that&#39;s because by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.580" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">it you indicate to the dragon that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.730" style="s2">you&#39;re bigger than you thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.980" style="s2">and that you&#39;re bigger than it thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.730" end="00:51:36.540" style="s2">you were and that&#39;s very very useful so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.980" end="00:51:38.220" style="s2">anyways you lay out your cards and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.540" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">you start to organize them it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.220" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">well actually I only have ten problems</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:43.620" style="s2">all right so then you think well how can</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.240" style="s2">we break those problems down into</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.620" end="00:51:46.770" style="s2">manageable subproblems and how can you</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.240" end="00:51:49.650" style="s2">go about addressing them that can be</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.770" end="00:51:52.080" style="s2">very complicated I hate my job well do</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.650" end="00:51:53.580" style="s2">you have an alternative no well why not</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.080" end="00:51:55.470" style="s2">well I don&#39;t have a resume</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.580" end="00:51:58.590" style="s2">I hate being interviewed I&#39;m afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.470" end="00:52:00.780" style="s2">make a resume I love stop my education I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.590" end="00:52:02.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have any options it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.780" end="00:52:04.950" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of problems man and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.820" end="00:52:06.210" style="s2">you know those are strategic problems so</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.950" end="00:52:09.270" style="s2">then you have to figure out how to help</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.210" end="00:52:11.370" style="s2">the person strategize and then implement</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.270" end="00:52:13.950" style="s2">the strategies and so the next step is</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.370" end="00:52:17.220" style="s2">okay now we know your problems if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.950" end="00:52:19.200" style="s2">could have a solution like that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.220" end="00:52:20.310" style="s2">the opposite of the problem what might a</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.200" end="00:52:23.070" style="s2">solution look like</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.310" end="00:52:24.390" style="s2">same issue it&#39;s like well there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.070" end="00:52:25.830" style="s2">of solutions I don&#39;t know what to do</p>

<p begin="00:52:51.000" end="00:52:55.590" style="s2">would be a cure what would that look</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.430" end="00:54:03.000" style="s2">the cure and then you break it down into</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.500" end="00:54:05.549" style="s2">the strategic elements that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.000" end="00:54:07.650" style="s2">necessary to be implemented on a day to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.549" end="00:54:10.140" style="s2">day basis and you do that so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.650" end="00:54:12.569" style="s2">they&#39;re difficult but attainable and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.140" end="00:54:13.859" style="s2">then the person if they&#39;re not difficult</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.569" end="00:54:16.799" style="s2">then they&#39;re not worth attaining</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.859" end="00:54:18.299" style="s2">obviously obviously you&#39;re not pushing</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.799" end="00:54:19.829" style="s2">yourself and you want the person not</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.299" end="00:54:21.569" style="s2">only to develop in the direction they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.829" end="00:54:23.460" style="s2">supposed to develop but you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.569" end="00:54:24.990" style="s2">them better at developing so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.460" end="00:54:27.529" style="s2">push them just like you do with kids or</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.990" end="00:54:30.650" style="s2">yourself if you have any sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.529" end="00:54:34.140" style="s2">we&#39;ll break it down into small</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.650" end="00:54:36.359" style="s2">implementable daily processes and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.140" end="00:54:38.670" style="s2">you review those with your with your</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.359" end="00:54:40.289" style="s2">client none of that&#39;s wallowing itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.670" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">petty man quite the contrary</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.289" end="00:54:46.980" style="s2">quite the contrary so so psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:48.809" style="s2">is get your story together who are you</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.980" end="00:54:51.809" style="s2">where you&#39;re going where are you going</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.809" end="00:54:53.490" style="s2">what&#39;s your strategy how are you going</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.809" end="00:54:55.289" style="s2">to learn to overcome the frightening and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.490" end="00:54:56.940" style="s2">unexpected things that are going to pop</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.289" end="00:54:59.279" style="s2">up at you when you implement that</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.940" end="00:55:00.750" style="s2">strategy so when those can be some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.279" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">those things can be the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.750" end="00:55:05.700" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid of death I&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:07.079" style="s2">illness I&#39;m afraid of insanity and some</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.700" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">of those can be the social world I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.079" end="00:55:11.279" style="s2">afraid of my boss I&#39;m afraid of my wife</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:13.230" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid of my friends I&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.279" end="00:55:15.150" style="s2">being humiliated I&#39;m afraid that people</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.230" end="00:55:17.039" style="s2">won&#39;t like me those are the two big</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.150" end="00:55:19.380" style="s2">classes of fears right fear of the great</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.039" end="00:55:21.569" style="s2">mother nature fear of the great father</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.380" end="00:55:23.190" style="s2">culture and if you&#39;re really afraid you</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.569" end="00:55:25.140" style="s2">get to have both those fears at the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.190" end="00:55:26.730" style="s2">time so there&#39;s nothing about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.140" end="00:55:29.250" style="s2">that&#39;s wallowing in self-pity</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.730" end="00:55:30.330" style="s2">quite the contrary it&#39;s a bad therapist</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.250" end="00:55:32.130" style="s2">that does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.330" end="00:55:35.940" style="s2">not there to make to feel sorry for you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.130" end="00:55:38.430" style="s2">they are there to be on the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.940" end="00:55:40.500" style="s2">part of you that&#39;s aiming up and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.430" end="00:55:41.730" style="s2">encourage you and to allow you to have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.500" end="00:55:44.790" style="s2">space where you can lay out your</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.790" end="00:55:48.120" style="s2">where you can lay out your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.170" end="00:55:50.550" style="s2">about what&#39;s wrong with you and how that</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.120" end="00:55:54.120" style="s2">might be set right there&#39;s nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.550" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">with wallowing in self-pity I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.120" end="00:55:58.200" style="s2">to calculate high resolution utopia for</p>

<p begin="00:55:58.200" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">fortune how do I ensure the meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:05.880" style="s2">experience itself determined well you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:07.740" style="s2">can&#39;t because there&#39;s an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.880" end="00:56:10.440" style="s2">element to existence so it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.740" end="00:56:12.300" style="s2">be squandered to some degree by fortune</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.440" end="00:56:13.650" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s not the point what are</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.300" end="00:56:15.480" style="s2">you gonna do just sit back on your</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.650" end="00:56:19.020" style="s2">laurels and wait for things to roll over</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.480" end="00:56:22.650" style="s2">you so what you do look the hero myth</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.020" end="00:56:24.660" style="s2">basically says go out there confront the</p>

<p begin="00:56:45.780" end="00:56:50.670" style="s2">might say well what happens if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.150" end="00:56:52.620" style="s2">follow the divine path and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.670" end="00:56:54.180" style="s2">might be well everything turns out</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.620" end="00:56:57.330" style="s2">perfectly because God is on your side</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.180" end="00:56:58.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like no that isn&#39;t what happens</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.780" end="00:57:16.470" style="s2">found so useful about the biblical</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.390" style="s2">could say in part God is that force</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.260" end="00:57:29.250" style="s2">within you which calls you to the</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.369" end="01:00:03.500" style="s2">this and get a higher industriousness</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.690" end="01:00:05.970" style="s2">okay first of all that&#39;s not that low</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.500" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">okay we got to think about percentiles</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.970" end="01:00:09.300" style="s2">here for a minute because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.010" style="s2">percentages they&#39;re different so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.300" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">you&#39;re at the 23rd percentile and there</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.010" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">were four people in a room you&#39;d be the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:15.720" style="s2">least industrious of four of them and</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:19.109" style="s2">that kind of puts you in the average</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.720" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">range it&#39;s not that big a deal there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.109" end="01:00:21.960" style="s2">problems with it we&#39;ll get to that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:24.119" style="s2">although you may maybe your height and</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.960" end="01:00:27.660" style="s2">openness to it anyway so I won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.119" end="01:00:29.430" style="s2">into that Lowell would be fifth</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.660" end="01:00:31.619" style="s2">percentile because that makes you one in</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.430" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">twenty or second percentile because that</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.619" end="01:00:35.849" style="s2">makes you one in fifty it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:37.530" style="s2">interesting to visualize a fairly large</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.849" end="01:00:39.450" style="s2">high school class and then to think of</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.530" end="01:00:41.790" style="s2">yourself as situated and there if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.450" end="01:00:43.770" style="s2">the least industrious person out of 50</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.790" end="01:00:45.300" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be a problem you better</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.770" end="01:00:47.190" style="s2">be smart or have some other things going</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.300" end="01:00:48.990" style="s2">for you because you&#39;re gonna have a hard</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.190" end="01:00:52.980" style="s2">time being diligent enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.990" end="01:00:55.560" style="s2">successful okay having said that so and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.980" end="01:00:57.480" style="s2">maybe first percentile makes you one in</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.560" end="01:00:59.130" style="s2">a hundred and point zero point one</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.480" end="01:01:00.510" style="s2">percentile makes you one in a thousand</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.130" end="01:01:04.109" style="s2">so you got to think about percentiles</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.510" end="01:01:05.339" style="s2">properly so having said that let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.109" end="01:01:08.569" style="s2">you&#39;re not very high in industriousness</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.339" end="01:01:11.790" style="s2">what should you do a make a dam plan</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.569" end="01:01:13.170" style="s2">okay you need a plan for your life and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.790" end="01:01:15.060" style="s2">would say use the future authoring</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.170" end="01:01:16.650" style="s2">program because that will help you make</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.060" end="01:01:18.420" style="s2">a plan or make a plan on your own that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.650" end="01:01:20.280" style="s2">fine or make a plan because you talked</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.420" end="01:01:21.839" style="s2">to someone but you know we put the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.280" end="01:01:24.150" style="s2">future authoring program together to</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.839" end="01:01:26.520" style="s2">help people develop a vision of where</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.150" end="01:01:28.410" style="s2">they could be a counter vision to scare</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.520" end="01:01:30.210" style="s2">the hell out of them by helping them</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.410" end="01:01:31.440" style="s2">think through how catastrophic things</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.210" end="01:01:33.660" style="s2">could become if they let all their</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.440" end="01:01:35.730" style="s2">stupidities get the upper hand and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.660" end="01:01:37.619" style="s2">a second part of the program that helps</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.730" end="01:01:39.329" style="s2">you make a strategy and we know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.619" end="01:01:41.700" style="s2">future authoring program helps people</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.329" end="01:01:43.589" style="s2">young man in particular who are doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.700" end="01:01:45.270" style="s2">worse by the way in academic situations</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.589" end="01:01:47.460" style="s2">it increases the probability that they</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.270" end="01:01:50.250" style="s2">will stay in college and university by</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.460" end="01:01:52.920" style="s2">between 25 and 50 percent so make a damn</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.250" end="01:01:55.560" style="s2">plan and make one you want like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.920" end="01:01:57.089" style="s2">make a plan that is what you should do</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.560" end="01:02:00.390" style="s2">even though it will be what you should</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.089" end="01:02:03.089" style="s2">do make a plan that outlines a future so</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.390" end="01:02:05.280" style="s2">that you can sit back and say look if I</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.089" end="01:02:06.630" style="s2">had that future than all the horrible</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.280" end="01:02:09.060" style="s2">things that are going to happen to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.630" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">are going to be worthwhile that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.060" end="01:02:11.549" style="s2">you want</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:14.309" style="s2">so you want to think this game is worth</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.549" end="01:02:16.650" style="s2">playing despite its tragedy that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.309" end="01:02:19.289" style="s2">you&#39;ve got in life enough meaning to</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.650" end="01:02:21.180" style="s2">serve as an antidote to tragedy all</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.289" end="01:02:22.859" style="s2">right now and then you generate a</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.180" end="01:02:24.359" style="s2">strategy and then the other thing you</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.859" end="01:02:26.189" style="s2">should do if you&#39;re not very industrious</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.359" end="01:02:28.609" style="s2">enough industrious is discipline</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.189" end="01:02:31.529" style="s2">yourself and so what do you do with that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.609" end="01:02:33.209" style="s2">eat three times a day at regular</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.529" end="01:02:35.459" style="s2">mealtimes that&#39;s a good thing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.209" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">practice because that starts to put some</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.459" end="01:02:39.869" style="s2">stability into your life get up at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:41.309" style="s2">same time I would highly recommend all</p>

<p begin="01:02:48.329" end="01:02:51.209" style="s2">partly because you don&#39;t need as much</p>

<p begin="01:03:18.179" end="01:03:22.259" style="s2">book I would recommend by the way</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.499" end="01:03:24.170" style="s2">showing that if you work 13% longer</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.259" end="01:03:26.759" style="s2">hours you make 40 percent more money</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.170" end="01:03:28.739" style="s2">it&#39;s nonlinear so you think why is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.759" end="01:03:30.689" style="s2">well imagine you had 10 employees and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.739" end="01:03:34.019" style="s2">one of them works an extra 10 percent</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.689" end="01:03:37.289" style="s2">it&#39;s not much well how often is that</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.289" end="01:03:40.650" style="s2">have a clue as a boss it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:03:40.650" end="01:03:44.069" style="s2">gonna think oh that guy&#39;s always here</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.910" end="01:03:45.410" style="s2">like 45 minutes early it&#39;s like why</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.069" end="01:03:48.299" style="s2">don&#39;t we give him the promotion</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.410" end="01:03:51.630" style="s2">obviously right so these tie these small</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.299" end="01:03:54.420" style="s2">edges that you can manage like that work</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.630" end="01:03:56.459" style="s2">an extra 10% extra 13% have no</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.420" end="01:04:01.499" style="s2">unproportional payoffs that&#39;s part of</p>

<p begin="01:04:09.779" end="01:04:14.219" style="s2">not relevant it&#39;s like discipline</p>

<p begin="01:04:20.489" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">of you many of you out there do not use</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.259" end="01:04:25.830" style="s2">a calendar okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:29.100" style="s2">is not a prison and it&#39;s not a tyrant</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.830" end="01:04:31.500" style="s2">not if you use it properly a calendar</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.100" end="01:04:33.750" style="s2">keeps anxiety at bay it makes sure that</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.500" end="01:04:35.070" style="s2">you do what you need to do which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.750" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">important because otherwise you fall</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.070" end="01:04:39.210" style="s2">behind but if you use it properly though</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:40.530" style="s2">it&#39;s also helps you plan what you want</p>

<p begin="01:04:57.090" end="01:05:02.220" style="s2">you need a plan for three years you need</p>

<p begin="01:05:10.320" end="01:05:15.090" style="s2">all of that all of that I make lists</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.320" end="01:05:17.400" style="s2">constantly of what I have to do and</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.090" end="01:05:19.530" style="s2">they&#39;re like daily weekly monthly yearly</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.400" end="01:05:21.390" style="s2">right now I can&#39;t look out more than</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.530" end="01:05:23.310" style="s2">about six months you know because my</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.390" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">life is too complicated and chaotic but</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.310" end="01:05:28.290" style="s2">but you need a vision of who you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.330" style="s2">be what character you could have three</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.290" end="01:05:31.950" style="s2">to five years out you can&#39;t go much</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.330" end="01:05:35.070" style="s2">farther than that because life is too</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.950" end="01:05:40.340" style="s2">unpredictable I think to make vision</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.070" end="01:05:43.080" style="s2">that&#39;s longer-term than that subject to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.340" end="01:05:44.609" style="s2">there&#39;s too much chance associated with</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.080" end="01:05:46.320" style="s2">it to spend a lot of time on maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.609" end="01:05:48.930" style="s2">can stretch it to five years and in rare</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.320" end="01:05:51.300" style="s2">cases you can have a ten-year goal but</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.930" end="01:05:52.950" style="s2">it has to be pretty low resolution but</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.300" end="01:05:54.630" style="s2">you want plans at all those levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.950" end="01:05:56.850" style="s2">resolution you want to write the things</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.630" end="01:05:58.320" style="s2">down and what because what are you gonna</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.850" end="01:05:59.130" style="s2">do you&#39;re gonna stumble around and get</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.320" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">to get what you need</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.130" end="01:06:02.730" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna stumble around and be</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.320" style="s2">useful to other people and it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.730" end="01:06:06.359" style="s2">to be useful to other people you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.320" end="01:06:08.100" style="s2">they want to work with you then they</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.359" end="01:06:09.690" style="s2">want to do things with you they want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.100" end="01:06:11.640" style="s2">have you around they trust you they open</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.690" end="01:06:13.290" style="s2">up opportunities for you and if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.640" end="01:06:14.820" style="s2">stumble around like you&#39;re blind you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.290" end="01:06:16.350" style="s2">not gonna get anywhere and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.820" end="01:06:18.660" style="s2">gonna suffer then you&#39;re gonna be bitter</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.350" end="01:06:21.000" style="s2">and then you&#39;re gonna be cruel so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.660" end="01:06:23.490" style="s2">a bit that&#39;s hell that&#39;s a bad outcome</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.000" end="01:06:25.859" style="s2">so unless you want that don&#39;t aim for it</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.490" end="01:06:29.119" style="s2">and or it or aim for the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.859" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">because that&#39;s how you get out of it so</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.119" end="01:06:33.570" style="s2">physical attractiveness is extensively</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.550" style="s2">studied in departments of psychology how</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.570" end="01:06:37.230" style="s2">big of a determinant of success is it</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.550" end="01:06:42.560" style="s2">apart from IQ or any of the other</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.230" end="01:06:44.609" style="s2">five traits that&#39;s tough one because</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.560" end="01:06:47.700" style="s2">physical attractiveness is a very</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.609" end="01:06:50.070" style="s2">complex trait it&#39;s also for example it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.700" end="01:06:52.590" style="s2">a marker of health and of course health</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.070" end="01:06:55.080" style="s2">is a mark is a prerequisite for success</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.590" end="01:06:56.970" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.080" end="01:06:59.330" style="s2">you can&#39;t take attractiveness as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.970" end="01:07:02.730" style="s2">unitary dimension and measure it</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.330" end="01:07:05.730" style="s2">sufficiently accurately wait I should</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.730" end="01:07:08.010" style="s2">back up on that no one that I know of</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.730" end="01:07:10.920" style="s2">has taken physical attractiveness as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.010" end="01:07:13.710" style="s2">unitary concept measured it accurately</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.920" end="01:07:16.950" style="s2">and then pitted against IQ and the big</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.710" end="01:07:19.260" style="s2">five to see if it to what degree it adds</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.950" end="01:07:22.200" style="s2">incremental validity to the prediction</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.260" end="01:07:23.970" style="s2">of long-term success but physical but</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.200" end="01:07:26.250" style="s2">and so I can&#39;t give you a technical</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.970" end="01:07:28.290" style="s2">answer you know I can say well in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.250" end="01:07:29.970" style="s2">complex job over the long-run IQ</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.290" end="01:07:31.500" style="s2">accounts for maybe 20 percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.970" end="01:07:35.580" style="s2">variance in success leaving eighty</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.500" end="01:07:37.410" style="s2">percent therefore random events and and</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.580" end="01:07:39.990" style="s2">the big five traits and connection</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.410" end="01:07:40.950" style="s2">networks and and family background and</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.990" end="01:07:43.380" style="s2">all those other things</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.950" end="01:07:45.750" style="s2">gender perhaps that all the other things</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.380" end="01:07:47.880" style="s2">that determine success physical that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.750" end="01:07:49.470" style="s2">we know that physical at people who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.880" end="01:07:51.480" style="s2">physically attractive though are given</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.470" end="01:07:54.510" style="s2">the benefit of doubt by other people</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.480" end="01:07:56.250" style="s2">they they benefit from the positive halo</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.510" end="01:07:59.130" style="s2">effect and the positive halo effect is</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.250" end="01:08:00.780" style="s2">the propensity of people to assume good</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.130" end="01:08:02.670" style="s2">things about someone if there is one</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.780" end="01:08:05.160" style="s2">outstanding thing about them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.670" end="01:08:07.500" style="s2">easily evident that&#39;s good and so if</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.160" end="01:08:09.210" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re if you stand up</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.500" end="01:08:10.830" style="s2">straight with your shoulders back so</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.210" end="01:08:12.300" style="s2">that&#39;s rule one and twelve rules for</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.830" end="01:08:14.190" style="s2">life then people are gonna see you as</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.300" end="01:08:16.350" style="s2">more attractive if you&#39;re symmetrical</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.190" end="01:08:19.940" style="s2">you&#39;re more attractive if you&#39;re thin</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.350" end="01:08:22.440" style="s2">but not too thin you&#39;re more attractive</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.940" end="01:08:24.390" style="s2">well and then there&#39;s like good skin and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.440" end="01:08:26.069" style="s2">good teeth and good hair and and all of</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.390" end="01:08:27.690" style="s2">those things and proper proportions and</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.069" end="01:08:30.509" style="s2">youth and there&#39;s a whole slew of things</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.690" end="01:08:32.520" style="s2">that that that feed into that if you are</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.509" end="01:08:34.049" style="s2">characterized by a plethora of those</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.520" end="01:08:35.460" style="s2">features then people are also going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.049" end="01:08:39.870" style="s2">assume that you&#39;re more competent and</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.460" end="01:08:42.060" style="s2">more and more more worth having around</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.870" end="01:08:45.630" style="s2">let&#39;s say but the problem is is that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.060" end="01:08:48.000" style="s2">are so separating out the attractiveness</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.630" end="01:08:49.650" style="s2">from the things the attractiveness is</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.000" end="01:08:50.469" style="s2">correlated with is very hard that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.650" end="01:08:52.690" style="s2">you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.469" end="01:08:55.870" style="s2">multivariate analysis that&#39;s multi</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.690" end="01:08:57.339" style="s2">variable analysis in any complex social</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.870" end="01:09:01.029" style="s2">science because a lot of these traits</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.339" end="01:09:03.250" style="s2">overlap so but you know you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.029" end="01:09:04.989" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some some things you can</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.250" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">do about that postural adjustment is</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.989" end="01:09:09.190" style="s2">helpful to work out with weights that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:11.020" style="s2">extraordinarily helpful that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.190" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">increases improves your posture and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.020" end="01:09:18.219" style="s2">makes you more confident and and and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">and at and you can dress reasonably well</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.219" end="01:09:23.290" style="s2">and intelligently and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:25.239" style="s2">things to help yourself capitalize on</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.290" end="01:09:32.980" style="s2">whatever attractiveness you can muster</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.239" end="01:09:34.930" style="s2">so what is your view on psychological</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.980" end="01:09:37.390" style="s2">egoism if we&#39;re all ultimately acting</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.930" end="01:09:38.799" style="s2">out of self-interest then does altruism</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.390" end="01:09:41.319" style="s2">have any merit I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.799" end="01:09:42.940" style="s2">question is well posed and that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.319" end="01:09:45.400" style="s2">one of those questions that leads into a</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.940" end="01:09:48.219" style="s2">philosophical dead-end because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.400" end="01:09:50.770" style="s2">well post there isn&#39;t any such thing as</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.219" end="01:09:53.350" style="s2">self-interest it&#39;s not the right way to</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.770" end="01:09:56.290" style="s2">think about it because you&#39;re not alone</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.350" end="01:09:57.610" style="s2">and so this is why I like Piaget Jean</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.290" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">Piaget because he thought about this</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.610" end="01:10:04.120" style="s2">intelligently look first of all whose</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:05.590" style="s2">self-interest to you me do you mean your</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.120" end="01:10:06.760" style="s2">immediate self-interest in the next</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.590" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">second so that would be impulsive</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.760" end="01:10:10.420" style="s2">pleasure we&#39;re all acting for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:12.010" style="s2">gaining of impulsive pleasure and to</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.420" end="01:10:14.140" style="s2">hell with everything else well obviously</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.010" end="01:10:17.140" style="s2">that&#39;s a stupid way to behave because</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.140" end="01:10:19.390" style="s2">and everyone knows that because you can</p>

<p begin="01:11:46.910" end="01:11:49.970" style="s2">about that so then let&#39;s say well that</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.710" end="01:11:53.030" style="s2">would be acting in your self-interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.970" end="01:11:56.510" style="s2">writ large right across time spans but</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.030" end="01:11:57.860" style="s2">the thing is future you and someone else</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.510" end="01:11:59.870" style="s2">that you have to live with right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.860" end="01:12:02.420" style="s2">that&#39;s not you are pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.870" end="01:12:03.710" style="s2">people and so if you&#39;re gonna act in</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.420" end="01:12:05.450" style="s2">your self-interest and you have other</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.710" end="01:12:06.860" style="s2">people around you then you also want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.450" end="01:12:08.660" style="s2">act in their self-interest because</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.860" end="01:12:10.370" style="s2">otherwise they won&#39;t like you they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.660" end="01:12:12.020" style="s2">cooperate with you and they won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:12:12.020" end="01:12:17.090" style="s2">and so that&#39;s going to be a catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.640" end="01:12:19.340" style="s2">and so you want to act out what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.090" end="01:12:21.920" style="s2">for you now and what&#39;s good for you next</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.340" end="01:12:23.450" style="s2">month and next year and you want to do</p>

<p begin="01:12:29.960" end="01:12:32.870" style="s2">the same time</p>

<p begin="01:12:37.370" end="01:12:41.810" style="s2">proper moral judgment and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.930" end="01:12:43.820" style="s2">brilliant idea it&#39;s a brilliant idea and</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.810" end="01:12:45.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s your true self interest</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.820" end="01:12:47.540" style="s2">there&#39;s no difference between your</p>

<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:32.270" style="s2">together and stop being so unnecessarily</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.830" end="01:13:34.460" style="s2">malevolent and that&#39;s in your</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.270" end="01:13:36.199" style="s2">self-interest so the idea that your</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.460" end="01:13:38.179" style="s2">self-interest is somehow opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.199" end="01:13:39.770" style="s2">other people&#39;s or that if you maximize</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:47.179" style="s2">predicated on a poor idea of what</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.590" end="01:13:48.949" style="s2">constitutes your self-interest because</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.179" end="01:13:50.780" style="s2">you&#39;re not separate in any real sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.949" end="01:13:52.730" style="s2">from other people you may be not</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.780" end="01:13:56.389" style="s2">separate from everything in some real</p>

<p begin="01:13:56.389" end="01:13:59.690" style="s2">book mysterium Kim Yong sness he had</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.489" end="01:14:02.239" style="s2">this idea I&#39;m going to go through it</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.690" end="01:14:04.130" style="s2">real quick it&#39;s a complicated idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.239" end="01:14:06.710" style="s2">this is how you put yourself together</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.130" end="01:14:07.909" style="s2">the first thing you do is you you join</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.710" end="01:14:11.510" style="s2">your emotions and your and your</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.909" end="01:14:13.790" style="s2">rationality so that so that your mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.510" end="01:14:16.909" style="s2">and your emotions are one thing he</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.790" end="01:14:19.820" style="s2">called that the first conjunction so</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.909" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">that your motivations and your emotions</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.820" end="01:14:22.280" style="s2">and the way that you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:24.050" style="s2">world are all acting in the same</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.280" end="01:14:25.310" style="s2">direction okay so that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.050" end="01:14:27.250" style="s2">conjunction and you get your act</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.310" end="01:14:29.030" style="s2">together that way so that would mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.250" end="01:14:30.860" style="s2">incorporation of aggression and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.030" end="01:14:32.449" style="s2">sexuality from a Freudian perspective</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.860" end="01:14:34.850" style="s2">those parts of you that are difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.449" end="01:14:37.610" style="s2">integrate come to be integrated into one</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.850" end="01:14:39.650" style="s2">thing so you can use your anger when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.610" end="01:14:41.840" style="s2">need to and you have your sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.650" end="01:14:43.489" style="s2">under control it doesn&#39;t have you but</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.840" end="01:14:47.750" style="s2">you know how to use it and it&#39;s a power</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.489" end="01:14:49.370" style="s2">for you and and you&#39;re properly</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.750" end="01:14:51.139" style="s2">assertive in all of those things and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.370" end="01:14:52.880" style="s2">you you build yourself into one</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.139" end="01:14:54.530" style="s2">psychological unit and then you embody</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.880" end="01:14:57.730" style="s2">that so that&#39;s the second conjunction</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.530" end="01:15:01.940" style="s2">the second conjunction is take your mind</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.730" end="01:15:04.310" style="s2">emotion motivation unity and act it out</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.940" end="01:15:05.989" style="s2">act it out in the world so that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.310" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">no distinction between you and what you</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.989" end="01:15:09.739" style="s2">do between you and the way you think</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:11.810" style="s2">about the world and your philosophy and</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.739" end="01:15:13.940" style="s2">how you act that makes you at second</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.810" end="01:15:15.290" style="s2">kind of unity and then the final</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.940" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">conjunction which is the most difficult</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.290" end="01:15:20.090" style="s2">one is to stop thinking that the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.080" end="01:15:22.070" style="s2">is different than you are this is why I</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.090" end="01:15:26.300" style="s2">ask people to clean up the rooms it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.070" end="01:15:27.350" style="s2">like your room is you it&#39;s you and so</p>

<p begin="01:15:48.190" end="01:15:51.730" style="s2">very difficult thing to understand and</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.660" end="01:15:53.320" style="s2">so you want to act in a way that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.730" end="01:15:55.390" style="s2">for you but good for everything else at</p>

<p begin="01:16:06.120" end="01:16:12.340" style="s2">psychological egoism and altruism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.250" end="01:16:15.220" style="s2">like if you&#39;re as you move towards a</p>

<p begin="01:16:48.820" end="01:16:53.830" style="s2">it&#39;s way more complicated than that you</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.550" end="01:16:57.670" style="s2">because then you live with a defeated</p>

<p begin="01:16:57.670" end="01:17:02.050" style="s2">take revenge on you then here you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.440" end="01:17:03.160" style="s2">very bright so you want to listen to</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.050" end="01:17:04.360" style="s2">what she has to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.160" end="01:17:05.770" style="s2">and you want to listen to her problems</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.360" end="01:17:08.560" style="s2">and you want to help her solve them</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.770" end="01:17:10.180" style="s2">because she&#39;s you and you want to do the</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.560" end="01:17:11.560" style="s2">same with your kids and then you want to</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.180" end="01:17:14.860" style="s2">do the same with the people around you</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.560" end="01:17:17.590" style="s2">if you can do it so and so the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.860" end="01:17:20.890" style="s2">idea of like well we&#39;re basically wired</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.590" end="01:17:24.160" style="s2">to be selfish well we are when we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.890" end="01:17:26.500" style="s2">very wise and we act impulsively but as</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.160" end="01:17:28.870" style="s2">your view of the world broadens you</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.500" end="01:17:31.000" style="s2">start to understand that this is why in</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.870" end="01:17:33.070" style="s2">the Buddhist philosophy no Buddha</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.000" end="01:17:35.350" style="s2">attained nirvana so that meant he could</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.070" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">stay in union with the gods so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.350" end="01:17:41.140" style="s2">he he attained the highest form of of</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:42.520" style="s2">subjective experience what might be but</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.140" end="01:17:43.460" style="s2">which might be something like total</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.520" end="01:17:46.010" style="s2">immersion in</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.460" end="01:17:48.140" style="s2">in bliss and meaning but he rejected it</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.010" end="01:17:51.140" style="s2">because he went back into the world to</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.140" end="01:17:52.489" style="s2">help other people attain nirvana or at</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.140" end="01:17:54.890" style="s2">least to move towards it because he</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.489" end="01:17:56.690" style="s2">realized that there was no individual</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.890" end="01:17:59.719" style="s2">redemption without the redemption of all</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.690" end="01:18:02.420" style="s2">and you if you don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.719" end="01:18:03.800" style="s2">then you&#39;re just not very wise and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.420" end="01:18:05.660" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to be a force for good in</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.800" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">the world and that doesn&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.660" end="01:18:11.530" style="s2">good for you that&#39;s just it&#39;s just blind</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:13.820" style="s2">because there isn&#39;t any isolated you</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.530" end="01:18:18.350" style="s2">that isn&#39;t how things are that&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.820" end="01:18:19.700" style="s2">realities lays itself out so what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.350" end="01:18:22.010" style="s2">your current thinking on Orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.700" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">Christianity the Orthodox Christians</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.010" end="01:18:28.010" style="s2">like me I don&#39;t know why but I think I</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:29.600" style="s2">have some idea I guess I&#39;ve got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.010" end="01:18:32.660" style="s2">letters from religious people a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.600" end="01:18:34.910" style="s2">lot from from Muslims from Jews from</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.660" end="01:18:40.430" style="s2">Orthodox Jews in particular strangely</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.910" end="01:18:42.260" style="s2">enough from Christian monk monks but a</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.430" end="01:18:43.790" style="s2">lot from Orthodox Christians and I think</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.260" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">the reason for that as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.790" end="01:18:48.920" style="s2">is that the Orthodox look at</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:50.540" style="s2">Christianity from a slightly different</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.920" end="01:18:52.190" style="s2">angle than the Protestants and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.540" end="01:18:53.570" style="s2">Catholics and I&#39;m not putting down the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.190" end="01:18:55.160" style="s2">Protestants and the Catholics they have</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.570" end="01:18:58.460" style="s2">a perspective a reason for their</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.160" end="01:19:00.219" style="s2">viewpoint but what&#39;s happened in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.460" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">West I think and this is a dreadful</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.219" end="01:19:05.770" style="s2">oversimplification so pre please forgive</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:09.380" style="s2">me is that the West has viewed</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.770" end="01:19:11.890" style="s2">Christianity more as a set of beliefs</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.380" end="01:19:14.780" style="s2">that are analogous in some sense to a</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.890" end="01:19:16.820" style="s2">cognitive theory of the world so to be a</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.780" end="01:19:19.219" style="s2">Christian in the West you have to accept</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.820" end="01:19:20.690" style="s2">that Christ died for your sins and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.219" end="01:19:23.719" style="s2">you&#39;re redeemed so you have to accept</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.690" end="01:19:26.630" style="s2">Christ as your Redeemer and that really</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.719" end="01:19:29.810" style="s2">means to state that you believe a set of</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.630" end="01:19:32.000" style="s2">propositions about Christ that he was</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.810" end="01:19:34.100" style="s2">the son of God and that his death and</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.000" end="01:19:36.620" style="s2">resurrection his sacrifice redeemed</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.100" end="01:19:39.560" style="s2">mankind and that and then you partake in</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.620" end="01:19:41.690" style="s2">that Redemption by laying out that a</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.560" end="01:19:44.750" style="s2">core that accordance with a set of facts</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.690" end="01:19:47.090" style="s2">let&#39;s say I don&#39;t I understand why</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.750" end="01:19:50.390" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s worked out but I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.090" end="01:19:52.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a big risk in that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.390" end="01:19:55.430" style="s2">think the Orthodox fell into that to the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.130" end="01:19:57.030" style="s2">same degree their idea more and this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.430" end="01:19:59.340" style="s2">there in Protestant</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.030" end="01:20:01.829" style="s2">and ISM and Catholicism - it&#39;s their it</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.340" end="01:20:03.539" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s given more secondary more</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.829" end="01:20:05.389" style="s2">implicit emphasis and I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.539" end="01:20:08.760" style="s2">problem especially in the modern world</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.389" end="01:20:10.230" style="s2">the Orthodox would say as near as I can</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.760" end="01:20:12.270" style="s2">tell that you should pick up your damn</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.230" end="01:20:13.139" style="s2">cross and stumble up the hill that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.270" end="01:20:15.510" style="s2">your job</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.139" end="01:20:17.039" style="s2">right and the cross is the X where</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.510" end="01:20:19.230" style="s2">everyone is located you right at the</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.039" end="01:20:21.480" style="s2">center of reality you&#39;re suffering and</p>

<p begin="01:20:21.480" end="01:20:25.050" style="s2">the center of reality as you transform</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.309" end="01:20:27.539" style="s2">and you have to accept that and embrace</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.050" end="01:20:29.400" style="s2">it you have to and that&#39;s very very hard</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.539" end="01:20:31.800" style="s2">thing to do because it means to embrace</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.400" end="01:20:33.750" style="s2">all your flaws and the flaws of reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.800" end="01:20:36.030" style="s2">and the tragedy of existence and your</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.750" end="01:20:40.520" style="s2">death and the sum total of human evil</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.030" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">all of that unbelievably demanding</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.520" end="01:20:44.489" style="s2">requirement but you do what you can to</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:47.250" style="s2">do that and then not only do you pick up</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.489" end="01:20:49.710" style="s2">your cross so to speak but you stumble</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.250" end="01:20:51.389" style="s2">uphill towards the City of God do you</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.710" end="01:20:54.179" style="s2">stumble up towards what&#39;s good and</p>

<p begin="01:20:58.829" end="01:21:03.090" style="s2">is the imitation of Christ and Christ is</p>

<p begin="01:21:59.789" end="01:22:04.230" style="s2">1930s but that was a long time ago and</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.099" end="01:22:06.239" style="s2">there weren&#39;t any powerful computational</p>

<p begin="01:22:08.400" end="01:22:14.199" style="s2">properly which we&#39;ve managed to do</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.719" end="01:22:16.690" style="s2">since about 1960 onward so now the</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.199" end="01:22:18.190" style="s2">myers-briggs is perfectly useful tool if</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.690" end="01:22:19.479" style="s2">what you want to do is get people to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.190" end="01:22:20.889" style="s2">talk about the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.479" end="01:22:23.829" style="s2">individual differences in personality</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.889" end="01:22:25.630" style="s2">and corporations love it because no one</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.829" end="01:22:27.670" style="s2">gets offended by it because everyone</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.630" end="01:22:29.440" style="s2">wins but if you want a personality test</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.670" end="01:22:31.840" style="s2">that actually tells you who you are</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.440" end="01:22:34.989" style="s2">that&#39;s valid and reliable then you use</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.840" end="01:22:37.210" style="s2">the big five and and that&#39;s that and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.989" end="01:22:39.070" style="s2">I would say the myers-briggs should be</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.210" end="01:22:40.869" style="s2">relegated to the dustbins of the past</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.070" end="01:22:42.789" style="s2">because it&#39;s a defunct and archaic</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.869" end="01:22:49.320" style="s2">instrument and it&#39;s no longer properly</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.789" end="01:22:49.320" style="s2">valid and so that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.180" end="01:22:59.630" style="s2">how can women who waited too long to</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.190" end="01:23:01.160" style="s2">have children find meaning in their</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.630" end="01:23:06.260" style="s2">lives once they realize their mistake</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.160" end="01:23:11.300" style="s2">how can we cope with the regret Jesus</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.260" end="01:23:14.810" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard question well you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.300" end="01:23:18.710" style="s2">there are other avenues to meaning right</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.810" end="01:23:21.380" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s the first thing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.710" end="01:23:22.550" style="s2">realize is that there are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.380" end="01:23:25.400" style="s2">intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.550" end="01:23:27.260" style="s2">there&#39;s familial relationships that</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.400" end="01:23:30.110" style="s2">aren&#39;t in accordance with children</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.260" end="01:23:31.910" style="s2">there&#39;s other people that you can serve</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.110" end="01:23:35.470" style="s2">there are other children that you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.910" end="01:23:37.790" style="s2">serve so what you have to do because</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.470" end="01:23:39.980" style="s2">intimate relationships are so important</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.790" end="01:23:41.240" style="s2">and I&#39;m including that close familiar</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.980" end="01:23:42.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not talking about sexual</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.240" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">relationships I&#39;m talking about very</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.410" end="01:23:45.350" style="s2">close social relationships the thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:48.440" style="s2">about having children</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.350" end="01:23:50.210" style="s2">if you&#39;re lucky is that you have a</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.440" end="01:23:51.830" style="s2">relationship there of a depth that you</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.210" end="01:23:53.750" style="s2">don&#39;t get anywhere else with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.830" end="01:23:56.360" style="s2">possible exception of your parents and</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.750" end="01:23:58.040" style="s2">siblings and your partner but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.360" end="01:24:00.860" style="s2">something about the child relationship</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.040" end="01:24:02.540" style="s2">that&#39;s even more fundamental because the</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.860" end="01:24:04.820" style="s2">thing about having a child is that if</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.540" end="01:24:05.960" style="s2">you have any sense as soon as you have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.820" end="01:24:08.240" style="s2">child you are no longer the most</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.960" end="01:24:09.650" style="s2">important person right you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.240" end="01:24:11.390" style="s2">the person that you have primary</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.650" end="01:24:13.220" style="s2">responsibility for it&#39;s now your child</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.390" end="01:24:14.960" style="s2">and that produces a psychological</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.220" end="01:24:16.520" style="s2">transformation and it produces a</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.960" end="01:24:18.590" style="s2">relationship of a depth that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.520" end="01:24:20.450" style="s2">easily duplicated elsewhere but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.590" end="01:24:23.750" style="s2">like that&#39;s the only thing that there is</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.450" end="01:24:26.420" style="s2">to do in life you know there there are</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.750" end="01:24:28.040" style="s2">other relationships and I would say what</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.420" end="01:24:29.780" style="s2">you do is you foster them to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.040" end="01:24:31.730" style="s2">that that&#39;s possible and maybe you could</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.780" end="01:24:32.930" style="s2">find other kids to serve you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.730" end="01:24:35.630" style="s2">there&#39;s always the possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.930" end="01:24:38.120" style="s2">volunteering for hospitals or or or</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.630" end="01:24:40.280" style="s2">working in places where children need</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.120" end="01:24:44.060" style="s2">service so that&#39;s a possibility as well</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.280" end="01:24:45.740" style="s2">and so you&#39;ve you know there are there</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.060" end="01:24:47.750" style="s2">are a variety of sources of meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.740" end="01:24:48.650" style="s2">people&#39;s lives and there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.750" end="01:24:49.910" style="s2">unlimited</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.650" end="01:24:51.650" style="s2">you know there&#39;s career there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.910" end="01:24:53.450" style="s2">education there&#39;s what you do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.650" end="01:24:54.350" style="s2">meaningful meaningfully engages you</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.450" end="01:24:55.850" style="s2">outside of work</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.350" end="01:24:58.520" style="s2">there&#39;s your social relations your</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.850" end="01:25:00.770" style="s2">friends and so forth and so maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.520" end="01:25:02.060" style="s2">have five wave legs to stand on and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.770" end="01:25:03.980" style="s2">missed one because you didn&#39;t have kids</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.060" end="01:25:05.810" style="s2">or maybe you missed two because kids are</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.980" end="01:25:07.250" style="s2">a big deal but that doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.810" end="01:25:09.260" style="s2">rest of them aren&#39;t accessible to you</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.250" end="01:25:09.750" style="s2">and so you optimize your functioning</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.260" end="01:25:11.610" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.750" end="01:25:14.730" style="s2">the dimensions that are left to you and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.610" end="01:25:16.950" style="s2">then I would also say maybe you try to</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.730" end="01:25:18.900" style="s2">forgive yourself a little bit you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.950" end="01:25:22.380" style="s2">like it&#39;s very difficult to go through</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.900" end="01:25:24.180" style="s2">life without without regrets without</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.380" end="01:25:25.710" style="s2">making mistakes you know and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.180" end="01:25:27.150" style="s2">beat yourself to death for it because</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.710" end="01:25:29.910" style="s2">then everyone would beat themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.150" end="01:25:35.430" style="s2">death all the time and so you think well</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.910" end="01:25:38.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I&#39;m I&#39;m too soon old and</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.430" end="01:25:40.260" style="s2">too late wise to use an old cliche and</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.040" end="01:25:42.510" style="s2">you think well that&#39;s the law of mankind</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.260" end="01:25:44.550" style="s2">we learn things too late often and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.510" end="01:25:46.290" style="s2">that&#39;s too bad and you forgive yourself</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.550" end="01:25:47.850" style="s2">because you&#39;re stupid and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.290" end="01:25:49.320" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;re unwise just</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.850" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">like everyone else and maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.320" end="01:25:52.860" style="s2">somewhat capable of learning if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:55.140" style="s2">careful and then you go out and you try</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.860" end="01:25:55.500" style="s2">to foster relations and do good in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.140" end="01:25:57.900" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.500" end="01:26:01.680" style="s2">to the degree that you can outside of</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.900" end="01:26:03.210" style="s2">the necessity of of children and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.680" end="01:26:05.820" style="s2">you have nephews nieces and you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.210" end="01:26:08.070" style="s2">lavish some attention on them and find</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.820" end="01:26:09.870" style="s2">your substitute where you can but I</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.070" end="01:26:11.370" style="s2">would say to forgive yourself is a big</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.870" end="01:26:14.130" style="s2">part of that it&#39;s like people make</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.370" end="01:26:16.320" style="s2">mistakes man big mistakes and the people</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.130" end="01:26:17.610" style="s2">that I&#39;ve watched through life that have</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.320" end="01:26:19.350" style="s2">been successful it&#39;s not like they</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.610" end="01:26:20.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t make mistakes because everyone</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.350" end="01:26:22.560" style="s2">makes mistakes and they do things they</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.850" end="01:26:25.770" style="s2">regret and they miss opportunities and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.560" end="01:26:28.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a bloody catastrophe but they treat</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.770" end="01:26:29.970" style="s2">themselves with some degree of mercy</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.230" end="01:26:32.040" style="s2">along with the justice it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.970" end="01:26:33.480" style="s2">well I screwed up there and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.040" end="01:26:35.520" style="s2">try to learn and I&#39;m not gonna do it</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.480" end="01:26:37.320" style="s2">again but I&#39;m not gonna beat myself to</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.520" end="01:26:39.780" style="s2">death so that I can&#39;t get up again and</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.320" end="01:26:41.970" style="s2">so you do what you can to forgive</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.780" end="01:26:44.220" style="s2">yourself you know it&#39;s a confusing time</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.970" end="01:26:46.080" style="s2">to live in in many ways because we have</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.220" end="01:26:48.210" style="s2">the birth control pill now and that</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.080" end="01:26:50.940" style="s2">means reproduction has now become</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.210" end="01:26:54.420" style="s2">voluntary well woman&#39;s a good time to</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.940" end="01:26:56.570" style="s2">reproduce well never because who would</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.420" end="01:26:59.430" style="s2">ever think about doing that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.570" end="01:27:01.290" style="s2">ridiculously irrational and complicated</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.430" end="01:27:03.420" style="s2">and the burden of responsibility is so</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.290" end="01:27:05.520" style="s2">insanely high and you never secure</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.420" end="01:27:07.620" style="s2">enough to to have the proper place to</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.520" end="01:27:09.060" style="s2">bring children into the world and you</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.620" end="01:27:11.670" style="s2">have to get your career going and your</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.060" end="01:27:13.170" style="s2">and your intimate relationship and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.670" end="01:27:14.670" style="s2">you have some struggle doing that and</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.170" end="01:27:18.240" style="s2">one day you wake up and it&#39;s a bit late</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.670" end="01:27:22.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah well you&#39;re a product of</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.240" end="01:27:23.660" style="s2">your time and one of the prices that</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.080" end="01:27:26.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to pay for have</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.660" end="01:27:28.920" style="s2">birth control for having reliable</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.430" end="01:27:31.050" style="s2">contraception is that some people are</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.920" end="01:27:33.090" style="s2">going to make the wrong decision with</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.050" end="01:27:34.800" style="s2">regards to having children and then you</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.090" end="01:27:36.420" style="s2">view yourself as a product of your time</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.800" end="01:27:38.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s a catastrophe you know</p>

<p begin="01:29:31.510" end="01:29:35.989" style="s2">why have confidence in an opinion when</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.249" end="01:29:38.239" style="s2">it could be wrong well partly because it</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.989" end="01:29:39.889" style="s2">could be right you know and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.239" end="01:29:42.710" style="s2">it&#39;s better to think about opinions as</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.889" end="01:29:44.510" style="s2">tools you know or maybe just dispense</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.710" end="01:29:47.030" style="s2">with opinions altogether because who</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.510" end="01:29:48.980" style="s2">cares about your stupid opinion but what</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.030" end="01:29:50.510" style="s2">you want is tools to work in the world</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.980" end="01:29:52.070" style="s2">and you think well I have a tool and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.510" end="01:29:53.989" style="s2">might work so like let&#39;s say that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:29:53.989" end="01:29:58.369" style="s2">your your tool kit is your conceptual</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.090" end="01:29:59.570" style="s2">the conceptual structure and the habits</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.369" end="01:30:01.519" style="s2">that you have that enable you to</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.570" end="01:30:04.070" style="s2">construe the situation and to conduct</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.519" end="01:30:07.010" style="s2">the negotiation well you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.070" end="01:30:08.659" style="s2">confidence that your that your tool kit</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.010" end="01:30:09.980" style="s2">is appropriate or you wouldn&#39;t go out</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.659" end="01:30:11.360" style="s2">there and test it and you say well I</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.980" end="01:30:12.730" style="s2">might be wrong it&#39;s like yeah but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.360" end="01:30:15.260" style="s2">not going to learn if you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.730" end="01:30:19.969" style="s2">unless you go out there and test it so</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.260" end="01:30:23.030" style="s2">you have to have provisional look let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.969" end="01:30:24.409" style="s2">say that you&#39;re well let&#39;s say that</p>

<p begin="01:30:27.739" end="01:30:31.400" style="s2">hit the nail well you aim at the nail</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.690" end="01:30:32.690" style="s2">and you hit it and you watch and if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.400" end="01:30:34.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t hit it quite right then you aim a</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.690" end="01:30:36.079" style="s2">little different you know so you have</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.340" end="01:30:37.400" style="s2">enough confidence to swing the hammer</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.079" end="01:30:40.070" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not paying</p>

<p begin="01:31:01.880" end="01:31:06.289" style="s2">pay attention to what happens and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:31:18.860" end="01:31:24.199" style="s2">they all go retool my opinion and so you</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.860" end="01:31:25.760" style="s2">you move out into the world not as a</p>

<p begin="01:31:34.789" end="01:31:39.019" style="s2">you think well it&#39;s not so much that I</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.199" end="01:31:41.599" style="s2">have confidence in my opinions I have I</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.019" end="01:31:42.079" style="s2">know that they&#39;re necessary to express</p>
