<p begin="00:00:09.000" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">the world faces is more than a single</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.459" end="00:00:14.850" style="s2">person can process single brain that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">can&#39;t actually hold that cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.850" end="00:00:18.420" style="s2">complexity so it requires collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:20.120" style="s2">intelligence and collective sense we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.420" end="00:00:22.890" style="s2">probably not going to solve the complex</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.120" end="00:00:25.860" style="s2">we give existential problems we face</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.890" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">with individual horsepower of thing</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:33.960" style="s2">to need to get together and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:36.090" style="s2">create a higher form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:40.230" style="s2">intelligence and sense making now what</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.090" end="00:00:41.750" style="s2">and how so the answer now what is</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.230" end="00:00:49.070" style="s2">decentralized collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.750" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">great how how do we do that so this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.070" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">film it&#39;s an intro to a new series about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">collective intelligence and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:00:59.430" style="s2">quite a significant moment I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">because it&#39;s about the trajectory of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">channel up until now rounding off part</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">of that journey of discovery and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:08.479" style="s2">talking about where we&#39;re going next and</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:13.499" style="s2">that also brings in some live events and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.479" end="00:01:14.850" style="s2">we&#39;re releasing two films one both of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.499" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">which I&#39;m really excited about but one</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.850" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">in particular the trial log between</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:21.959" style="s2">Jamie wheel Jordan green hall and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:23.279" style="s2">SHM Acton burger that was recorded about</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.959" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">three or four months ago members would</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.279" end="00:01:30.509" style="s2">have seen it and now we&#39;re releasing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:34.139" style="s2">to to everyone and I think it&#39;s the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.509" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">the most complete version of what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.139" end="00:01:38.999" style="s2">this sort of inquiry into collective</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">intelligence that we&#39;ve been been not</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.999" end="00:01:41.999" style="s2">and that wasn&#39;t one where the channels</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.869" style="s2">Sparta but it&#39;s where the channels ended</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.999" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">up coherence is this ephemeral</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.869" end="00:01:50.459" style="s2">emergent property the best never named</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.469" style="s2">they&#39;re never subject to reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.459" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">captured reality tunnel capture like</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.469" end="00:01:57.060" style="s2">it&#39;s that thing then how the hell do</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:02:00.270" style="s2">scale it cuz we&#39;re storytelling monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.060" end="00:02:01.799" style="s2">and at some point we need recipes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.270" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">help the thing propagate so this could</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.799" end="00:02:05.939" style="s2">enlist everybody&#39;s job Yodas then why</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:06.989" style="s2">does it always break down mm-hmm why</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.939" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">don&#39;t why every time we try to scout us</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.989" end="00:02:14.700" style="s2">a breakdown one of the reasons is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">because as our friend Lao Tzu discovered</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.700" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">by the way also a friend Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">discovered and her friend Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.269" style="s2">discovered every time the storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.620" end="00:02:22.739" style="s2">monkeys try to turn to a story to tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.269" end="00:02:25.519" style="s2">they it up</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.739" end="00:02:27.930" style="s2">so let&#39;s be mindful of that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.519" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">recognize that the storytelling piece of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.930" end="00:02:32.790" style="s2">it definitely isn&#39;t the answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">and I think this is sort of we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.790" end="00:02:36.120" style="s2">to talk about where we&#39;re going to go</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">next but we&#39;re also going to summarize</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.120" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">or going to kind of frame it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:42.870" style="s2">explain how we think the pieces fit</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:44.190" style="s2">together and play some clips from some</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.870" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">of those films and some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.190" end="00:02:48.120" style="s2">films we put out on the channel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:49.410" style="s2">a theme to all of this which is truth so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.120" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">it&#39;s a theme that&#39;s been running through</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.410" end="00:02:52.739" style="s2">the channel from the very beginning when</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:54.390" style="s2">you went out to interview Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:56.700" style="s2">Peterson - then we covered the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.390" end="00:02:58.590" style="s2">intellectual darkweb phenomena and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.700" end="00:03:00.390" style="s2">was really about people sitting down and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.590" end="00:03:03.540" style="s2">against the backdrop of an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.390" end="00:03:06.120" style="s2">chaotic polarized culture where truth</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.540" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">has become hyper relative you know some</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.120" end="00:03:10.739" style="s2">people call that post truth world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:12.989" style="s2">always been a some kind of inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.739" end="00:03:14.849" style="s2">some kind of quest to say how do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.989" end="00:03:16.349" style="s2">arrive at truth together so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.849" end="00:03:18.450" style="s2">intellectual dark web those long-form</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.349" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">conversations was a great first step in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.450" end="00:03:22.859" style="s2">that but we&#39;ve been saying since that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:24.750" style="s2">era as well since maybe this time last</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.859" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">year there&#39;s a deeper resolution to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.750" end="00:03:29.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a deeper way for us to come into</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:30.780" style="s2">contact with each other and arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.130" end="00:03:34.079" style="s2">something that feels like it wants to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.780" end="00:03:37.350" style="s2">emerge into the culture so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.079" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">of moving into an edge and a novelty</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.350" end="00:03:41.489" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t quite arrived at yet and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">that&#39;s very exciting mmm yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.489" end="00:03:45.720" style="s2">something that I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:46.650" style="s2">conversation with guys hang stock so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.720" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">other piece that we&#39;re putting out</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.650" end="00:03:50.310" style="s2">putting out the trial log and also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:52.410" style="s2">conversation with guys saying stock you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.310" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">invented circling and we&#39;ll talk a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.410" end="00:03:56.549" style="s2">more about what that and why we think</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:59.700" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant in a minute but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.549" end="00:04:03.980" style="s2">talked about how Jordan Pederson and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.700" end="00:04:06.150" style="s2">John Devaki as well had this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.980" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">there&#39;s something in the way they they</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.150" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">talk certainly when they&#39;re at their</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">best where they&#39;re they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:14.639" style="s2">going on an exploration and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">sense of an emergent journey that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.639" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">they&#39;re going on and you&#39;re going with</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">them that that they kind of that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:23.909" style="s2">there they&#39;re really tapped into an</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">inquiry it&#39;s not just I telling you what</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.909" end="00:04:27.550" style="s2">they know they&#39;re thinking in real time</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:29.590" style="s2">I think when people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.550" end="00:04:33.880" style="s2">what they like about Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.590" end="00:04:38.310" style="s2">they like the experience of hear of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.880" end="00:04:42.009" style="s2">listening to him because both John and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.310" end="00:04:44.139" style="s2">and Jordan you&#39;re right they have this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.009" end="00:04:47.380" style="s2">quality of that to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.139" end="00:04:48.819" style="s2">they&#39;re saying you must actually think</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.380" end="00:04:51.789" style="s2">the thought that they&#39;re thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.819" end="00:04:55.419" style="s2">and because they&#39;re right at the at onna</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.789" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">just at the her they&#39;re just always like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.419" end="00:04:59.830" style="s2">trying to speak what&#39;s just beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:02.199" style="s2">horizon right and you almost have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.830" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">allow yourself to be changed by it yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.199" end="00:05:07.780" style="s2">yes yes what I love about this piece</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">that we were going to deliver now in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.780" end="00:05:11.800" style="s2">this whole subject is that it brings</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:14.620" style="s2">together the big picture the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.800" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">philosophy the systems change the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.620" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">really deep inquiries that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:21.569" style="s2">the guests on our Channel have gone into</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:25.080" style="s2">into the sort of the more interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.569" end="00:05:28.389" style="s2">interrelated so circling is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.080" end="00:05:30.819" style="s2">inquiry so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a modality that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.389" end="00:05:33.759" style="s2">think guy said he came up with it about</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.819" end="00:05:34.990" style="s2">20 years ago and came up with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.759" end="00:05:37.270" style="s2">spontaneously and it took awhile to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.990" end="00:05:40.030" style="s2">actually give it a name but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.270" end="00:05:41.949" style="s2">form of conversation that felt really</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.030" end="00:05:43.630" style="s2">alive like how can we have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.949" end="00:05:47.349" style="s2">conversations that feel really alive</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.630" end="00:05:49.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had conversations where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.349" end="00:05:53.229" style="s2">come into the conversation one way and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.740" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">something about the dialogue right maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.229" end="00:05:56.680" style="s2">was super personal maybe was</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:05:59.199" style="s2">philosophical but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.680" end="00:06:04.590" style="s2">about the meeting such that you walked</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.199" end="00:06:04.590" style="s2">away and you are different somehow</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.319" end="00:06:09.979" style="s2">you could say is a yoga of those kinds</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.419" end="00:06:12.229" style="s2">of conversations it&#39;s about whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.979" end="00:06:15.129" style="s2">those asanas those postures and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.229" end="00:06:18.409" style="s2">communication it&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.129" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">stretching strengthening that muscle</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.409" end="00:06:23.990" style="s2">that is both available and generative of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:27.469" style="s2">those kinds of unexpected life-changing</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.990" end="00:06:28.639" style="s2">conversations I really enjoyed that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.469" end="00:06:29.749" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">conversation as well that you have with</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.749" end="00:06:33.349" style="s2">John Bob a key that will put the link in</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:35.589" style="s2">because that was really fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.349" end="00:06:37.789" style="s2">they both went into this real space of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.589" end="00:06:40.129" style="s2">inquiry together and you can just tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.789" end="00:06:42.919" style="s2">there&#39;s something about that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.129" end="00:06:45.080" style="s2">live conversation that just registers on</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:46.369" style="s2">some really deep level whether we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.080" end="00:06:48.949" style="s2">it or whether we&#39;re watching it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.369" end="00:06:50.689" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of this thirst for that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.949" end="00:06:52.969" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a difficult thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.689" end="00:06:54.229" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re if you have some</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.969" end="00:06:55.639" style="s2">kind of public profile and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.229" end="00:06:58.099" style="s2">happening in the media where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.639" end="00:07:00.740" style="s2">around complicated subject difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.099" end="00:07:02.199" style="s2">subjects where people get very triggered</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:04.430" style="s2">and get very defensive very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.199" end="00:07:05.719" style="s2">which incidentally links back to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.430" end="00:07:07.969" style="s2">films that we&#39;ve put out about the kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.719" end="00:07:10.309" style="s2">of neuroscience of difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.969" end="00:07:13.159" style="s2">conversation call it the De Niro science</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.309" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">of polarization but that&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.159" end="00:07:17.479" style="s2">relevant as well and the need for</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:19.909" style="s2">psychological safety to have these</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.479" end="00:07:23.169" style="s2">conversations slight digression back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.909" end="00:07:25.610" style="s2">the conversation with Guy there was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.169" end="00:07:28.550" style="s2">yeah I mean he&#39;s an amazing listener</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.610" end="00:07:32.689" style="s2">and asked really good questions but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.550" end="00:07:38.269" style="s2">also found myself entering into a space</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.689" end="00:07:40.519" style="s2">of emergence in the conversation just I</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.269" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">was sort of thoughts that I was dimly</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.519" end="00:07:43.099" style="s2">aware all the things I hadn&#39;t quite put</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:44.389" style="s2">together were actually being put</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.099" end="00:07:46.430" style="s2">together in real time and I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.389" end="00:07:48.259" style="s2">listening to myself talk and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.430" end="00:07:50.719" style="s2">really that was a really fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.259" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">process and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.719" end="00:07:55.519" style="s2">being witnessed in that that allows that</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:57.019" style="s2">to happen if you&#39;re with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.519" end="00:07:59.749" style="s2">just waiting for their turn to talk or</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.019" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">is kind of automatically filtering what</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.749" end="00:08:03.499" style="s2">you&#39;re saying into their kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:05.300" style="s2">pre-existing structure then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.499" end="00:08:08.749" style="s2">difficult for that emergence to come</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.300" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">about and we actually teach something in</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.749" end="00:08:12.169" style="s2">our workshops called inquiry an inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:13.639" style="s2">comes from a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.169" end="00:08:16.189" style="s2">background it&#39;s a little bit older it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.639" end="00:08:18.199" style="s2">comes from the ridwan school or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.189" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">diamondettes work and it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.199" end="00:08:21.540" style="s2">a talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:26.340" style="s2">so the idea and the way we introduced it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.540" end="00:08:28.470" style="s2">in the workshops is we we say don&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.340" end="00:08:29.790" style="s2">a story so even even if you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.470" end="00:08:31.650" style="s2">kind of why you&#39;re here and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.790" end="00:08:34.260" style="s2">hoping to get from this experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.650" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">don&#39;t tell a story try and tap into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.260" end="00:08:37.800" style="s2">space of where you&#39;re surprising</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:40.200" style="s2">yourself by what you&#39;re saying as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.800" end="00:08:42.510" style="s2">saying it and I imagine that there might</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.200" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">be people watching who are asking right</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.510" end="00:08:47.280" style="s2">now a pretty valid question which is why</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">bother having a conversation like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.280" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">when we could just talk about ideas you</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:54.839" style="s2">know which is often the way we try and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:56.040" style="s2">tackle challenging or complex problems</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.839" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">generally so you might have a debate</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.040" end="00:09:00.960" style="s2">around it or we might bash you know bash</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:02.490" style="s2">the ideas together and I disagree and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.960" end="00:09:04.110" style="s2">you just cream we kind of we might come</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.490" end="00:09:06.030" style="s2">to some kind of synthesis it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.110" end="00:09:07.830" style="s2">much easier to connect ideas and for</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.030" end="00:09:09.330" style="s2">something new to synthesize in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.830" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">conversation because neither of us are</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.330" end="00:09:13.200" style="s2">necessarily taking a position and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">know from you know research into</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:17.280" style="s2">mindfulness and research into similar</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:18.780" style="s2">practices that there&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.280" end="00:09:20.490" style="s2">significant brain changes that happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.780" end="00:09:21.930" style="s2">when we do that especially when we do it</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.490" end="00:09:23.640" style="s2">together so there&#39;s a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.930" end="00:09:25.740" style="s2">out there for it but I think the most</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.640" end="00:09:27.510" style="s2">important thing is testing it out and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.740" end="00:09:29.130" style="s2">noticing qualitatively where is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.510" end="00:09:31.380" style="s2">difference between when I have I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.130" end="00:09:33.710" style="s2">position you&#39;re in a position to when we</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.380" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">loosen that relax the grip on it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.710" end="00:09:38.130" style="s2">come with less attachment and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:39.450" style="s2">curiosity and see okay what you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.130" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">what&#39;s really happening right now as we</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.450" end="00:09:43.530" style="s2">talk yeah and it&#39;s about whether a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.700" end="00:09:46.290" style="s2">conversation has the capacity to go into</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.530" end="00:09:48.570" style="s2">new territory and and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.290" end="00:09:49.890" style="s2">initial promise of the the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.570" end="00:09:52.890" style="s2">the intellectual dark web when it first</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.890" end="00:09:53.970" style="s2">arrived there was this sense of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.890" end="00:09:56.220" style="s2">conversation where people could change</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.970" end="00:09:57.630" style="s2">their minds I haven&#39;t seen a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.220" end="00:09:59.640" style="s2">I haven&#39;t seen a lot of people changing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.630" end="00:10:01.020" style="s2">their minds I haven&#39;t seen and my great</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.640" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">hope at the beginning was also this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.020" end="00:10:06.030" style="s2">sense of maybe there could be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:08.190" style="s2">synthesis so the synthesis at the that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.030" end="00:10:09.240" style="s2">could we could see these public events</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.190" end="00:10:10.860" style="s2">and then there could be this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.240" end="00:10:12.390" style="s2">synthesis and we&#39;d be able to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.860" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">we&#39;re holding different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.390" end="00:10:15.990" style="s2">puzzle but but it&#39;s coming in the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:17.640" style="s2">direction from evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.990" end="00:10:20.360" style="s2">through to psychology through too many</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.640" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">different lenses that hasn&#39;t happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.360" end="00:10:25.170" style="s2">what was also really interesting with</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.680" style="s2">guy is that he was aware of the channel</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.170" end="00:10:29.230" style="s2">and has also kind of looked</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.680" end="00:10:30.850" style="s2">the the trajectory that we&#39;ve been going</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:34.029" style="s2">on and there&#39;s kind of recognized that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.850" end="00:10:36.040" style="s2">we are talking about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.029" end="00:10:38.829" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about that same emergent</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.040" end="00:10:40.269" style="s2">quality a lot of the the people on our</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.829" end="00:10:42.430" style="s2">channel are talking about that same</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.269" end="00:10:45.929" style="s2">emerging quality as well just the fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.430" end="00:10:48.579" style="s2">that you&#39;re listening for the emergent</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.929" end="00:10:51.959" style="s2">conversation just just the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.579" end="00:10:55.629" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing is in itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.959" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">impressive to me and also watching how</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.629" end="00:11:01.660" style="s2">the people that you&#39;re dialoguing with</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:04.029" style="s2">are in some way coach shaping your</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.660" end="00:11:06.579" style="s2">channel and watching the channel evolve</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.029" end="00:11:08.559" style="s2">and in such a way where it almost feels</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.579" end="00:11:14.170" style="s2">that the very thing that you have your</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.559" end="00:11:16.059" style="s2">eye on is is making is making what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.170" end="00:11:17.800" style="s2">emerging a kind of a self-awareness so</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.059" end="00:11:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like rebel wisdom in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.800" end="00:11:23.309" style="s2">certain sense is this way in which that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.559" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">which is emerging in the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.309" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">saying eye to itself and asking itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:31.809" style="s2">questions and stuff so I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:33.970" style="s2">appreciated the multi dimensions of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.809" end="00:11:35.199" style="s2">kind of comes through in all the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.970" end="00:11:38.769" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing it really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.199" end="00:11:41.559" style="s2">it a lot which is the other part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.769" end="00:11:43.929" style="s2">synthesis which is the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.559" end="00:11:47.829" style="s2">the the people who thought I&#39;m most</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.929" end="00:11:51.160" style="s2">compelled by and most intrigued by are</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.829" end="00:11:52.360" style="s2">also kind of independently I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.160" end="00:11:53.769" style="s2">they&#39;ve influenced each other quite a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.360" end="00:11:55.389" style="s2">bit but they&#39;re also independently</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.769" end="00:11:59.740" style="s2">coming to this position of realizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.389" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">that the the real question is is more</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.740" end="00:12:05.620" style="s2">about how we come to sense making at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:07.509" style="s2">and how we come to sense making together</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.620" end="00:12:09.999" style="s2">how we come to collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.509" end="00:12:11.230" style="s2">okay so why can&#39;t we trust any of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.429" end="00:12:17.799" style="s2">but basically we learn how to do</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.640" end="00:14:21.720" style="s2">i wonder i&#39;m curious how it maps on to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.460" end="00:14:24.300" style="s2">to what we&#39;re talking about right now</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.720" end="00:14:25.890" style="s2">because it was the word trans jack which</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.300" end="00:14:28.680" style="s2">i think is a fantastic word because i</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.890" end="00:14:30.630" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s this sense of normally we</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.680" end="00:14:32.160" style="s2">have okay my subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.630" end="00:14:35.220" style="s2">here&#39;s how i feel about this or that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.160" end="00:14:38.040" style="s2">then we have some attempts between us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.220" end="00:14:41.840" style="s2">reach an agreement around the around</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.040" end="00:14:44.460" style="s2">objective reality so you know but</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.840" end="00:14:45.990" style="s2">instead of those two being split off and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.460" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">completely separated from one another</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.990" end="00:14:51.960" style="s2">the idea of a trans Jaken</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.800" end="00:14:53.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a synthesis between the two and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.960" end="00:14:56.790" style="s2">they&#39;re playing off each other</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.730" end="00:14:59.449" style="s2">and therefore we in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.790" end="00:15:01.889" style="s2">having the conversation we start to move</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.449" end="00:15:03.870" style="s2">towards an objective truth which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.889" end="00:15:06.120" style="s2">which is also in part subjective so</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.870" end="00:15:08.279" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a paradox in a sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.120" end="00:15:10.260" style="s2">got the kind of one I&#39;m thinking of or</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.279" end="00:15:13.769" style="s2">kind of trying to feel into right now</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.260" end="00:15:15.660" style="s2">but I think there are a lot of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.769" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">difficulty with explaining this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.660" end="00:15:19.740" style="s2">way of having a conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:24.300" style="s2">there there are a lot of paradoxes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.740" end="00:15:26.279" style="s2">seems but the experience of it clicks</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.300" end="00:15:29.220" style="s2">it&#39;s more of a flow state than a regular</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.279" end="00:15:31.620" style="s2">conversation and so things just flow and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.220" end="00:15:33.870" style="s2">make sense and build and grow but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.620" end="00:15:36.029" style="s2">really difficult to then condense that</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.870" end="00:15:36.899" style="s2">down into talking about it so even what</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.029" end="00:15:39.870" style="s2">we&#39;re doing now there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.899" end="00:15:41.670" style="s2">paradoxical quality to it I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.870" end="00:15:45.029" style="s2">play a little clip from Jordan green</p>

<p begin="00:15:48.600" end="00:15:53.399" style="s2">for a while will be aware of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:55.320" style="s2">of broadcast and digital where broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.399" end="00:15:57.870" style="s2">is the underlying structure of how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.320" end="00:15:59.940" style="s2">run society for millennia since World</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.870" end="00:16:02.190" style="s2">War two through a system he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.940" end="00:16:03.750" style="s2">blue church the blue church emerge from</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.190" end="00:16:06.089" style="s2">the context of having to figure out how</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.089" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">generate coherence how do we get all of</p>

<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:15.149" style="s2">to be able to make sense of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.560" end="00:16:17.100" style="s2">some fashion that is able to then make</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.149" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">choices together and to act effectively</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.100" end="00:16:23.279" style="s2">right that&#39;s the question and the blue</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:25.019" style="s2">church developed to be the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.279" end="00:16:26.519" style="s2">that question answer developed the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.019" end="00:16:29.839" style="s2">ability to save for example use the</p>

<p begin="00:16:33.569" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">hierarchy it&#39;s very important that first</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.459" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">part that there&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">authority and receptor that has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:43.290" style="s2">broadcast modality so the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">very broadcast across its entire mode</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.290" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s very good reasons to believe</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:53.310" style="s2">that the blue church is done meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:55.230" style="s2">that it&#39;s in the senescence stage and</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.310" end="00:16:56.850" style="s2">senescence has a characteristic where</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.050" end="00:17:05.070" style="s2">now what and how so the answer now what</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.209" end="00:17:06.900" style="s2">is decentralized collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.070" end="00:17:08.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a developmental curve this idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.900" end="00:17:12.780" style="s2">of rate and state is pretty good here so</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.640" end="00:17:17.610" style="s2">blue church state of sense making choice</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.780" end="00:17:19.430" style="s2">making an actuation high rate down it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.610" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">getting less effective over time</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:28.950" style="s2">state low rate high so there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.000" end="00:17:30.510" style="s2">be a crossover point what we see is on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.950" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">occasion we&#39;ll see a breakthrough where</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.510" end="00:17:34.260" style="s2">this new thing has reached a point of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:35.730" style="s2">criticality where it&#39;s capacities are</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.260" end="00:17:38.970" style="s2">now good enough to show this actually</p>

<p begin="00:18:19.560" end="00:18:23.190" style="s2">going to play a little clip from Jamie</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.670" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">the digesting of our grief such that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.760" end="00:25:44.890" style="s2">no longer separate in my pain body and</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.540" style="s2">my narrative that wraps me around that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.890" end="00:25:49.540" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting because in Jamie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.540" end="00:25:51.040" style="s2">book stealing fire he explores and maps</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.540" end="00:25:53.860" style="s2">out the groups who are doing this really</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.040" end="00:25:56.020" style="s2">well so whether it&#39;s the Navy SEALs or</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.860" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">you know high-performing sports teams</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.020" end="00:25:59.590" style="s2">one of the things he points out is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">when it&#39;s done well when you really get</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.590" end="00:26:02.500" style="s2">a group of people together who are in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:03.880" style="s2">that coherence you have to be ruthless</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.500" end="00:26:06.370" style="s2">in it you have to be ruthlessly</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.880" end="00:26:08.140" style="s2">selective and get rid of I think what he</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.370" end="00:26:10.630" style="s2">calls the gray man is the phrase that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.140" end="00:26:12.250" style="s2">comes out which is that person who isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.630" end="00:26:13.780" style="s2">quite there and when push comes to shove</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.250" end="00:26:15.910" style="s2">when the bullets are flying or when</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.780" end="00:26:18.220" style="s2">you&#39;re two points down that&#39;s the person</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.910" end="00:26:21.130" style="s2">who ends up breaking everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.220" end="00:26:23.610" style="s2">flow so I kind of had that in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.130" end="00:26:25.690" style="s2">right now because we&#39;re on the cusp of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.610" end="00:26:28.150" style="s2">launching our own experiment in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.690" end="00:26:30.160" style="s2">area the the rebel wisdom collective</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.150" end="00:26:32.770" style="s2">intelligence lab and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.160" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve that&#39;s an open question I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.770" end="00:26:36.070" style="s2">know that gets us Jamie&#39;s inquiry and it</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:39.400" style="s2">becomes very relevant actually thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.070" end="00:26:41.890" style="s2">of ok how how does one go about building</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:44.050" style="s2">an experiment around this because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.890" end="00:26:46.630" style="s2">simultaneously I think has to be has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.050" end="00:26:48.640" style="s2">have that selection in it to see ok what</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:51.730" style="s2">group of people can together you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.640" end="00:26:53.080" style="s2">how can we all go somewhere new so</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.730" end="00:26:54.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain element of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.080" end="00:26:55.450" style="s2">ruthless about it but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.040" end="00:26:58.660" style="s2">there&#39;s the element of wanting to create</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.450" end="00:27:00.820" style="s2">a container and experience that allows</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.660" end="00:27:03.190" style="s2">people to relax also means not being too</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.820" end="00:27:05.170" style="s2">ruthless so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a tension I</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.190" end="00:27:06.790" style="s2">suppose I think that there&#39;s two memes</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.170" end="00:27:07.630" style="s2">at work at the moment there&#39;s the meme</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.790" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">of collapse</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.630" end="00:27:12.670" style="s2">and there&#39;s the meme of phase-shift and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:15.850" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s certainly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.670" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">lot of sense of collapse out there and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.850" end="00:27:19.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:21.640" style="s2">certainly among the intellectual circles</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.330" end="00:27:23.770" style="s2">that we&#39;re connected to and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.640" end="00:27:25.660" style="s2">a sense of what if that is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.770" end="00:27:27.190" style="s2">phase shift what is that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.660" end="00:27:28.810" style="s2">sort of what the piece that gangwish</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.190" end="00:27:31.570" style="s2">Mettenberger in particular is bringing</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.810" end="00:27:33.310" style="s2">I&#39;m saying we need an epoch shift it is</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.570" end="00:27:36.010" style="s2">not the continuation of the current</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.310" end="00:27:39.580" style="s2">curve that is a discrete nonlinear phase</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.010" end="00:27:41.350" style="s2">shift and that if we think about it as</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.580" end="00:27:42.760" style="s2">just continuation of current curves okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.350" end="00:27:43.960" style="s2">these things are getting better with</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.760" end="00:27:50.170" style="s2">tech let&#39;s just hope they keep getting</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.960" end="00:27:51.700" style="s2">better it doesn&#39;t work and so but if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.170" end="00:27:53.650" style="s2">say what are the necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.700" end="00:27:54.850" style="s2">sufficient criteria of a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.650" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t self germinate in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.850" end="00:27:58.870" style="s2">presence of the emerging power we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:27:59.890" style="s2">actually identify what those criteria</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.870" end="00:28:03.310" style="s2">are and they&#39;re actually things that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.890" end="00:28:04.690" style="s2">can do then that becomes the only mo</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.310" end="00:28:06.280" style="s2">that makes sentences working to bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.690" end="00:28:09.150" style="s2">that about so in the conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.280" end="00:28:11.280" style="s2">guy sang stock had with John de Bakey</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.150" end="00:28:12.690" style="s2">that was really yeah it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.280" end="00:28:15.540" style="s2">sort of emergent conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:16.530" style="s2">the two of them there was one piece was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.540" end="00:28:19.140" style="s2">a couple of things that they said that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.530" end="00:28:21.810" style="s2">just felt like real gems and one of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.140" end="00:28:25.110" style="s2">was that circling is about being alive</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.810" end="00:28:27.270" style="s2">to what wants to emerge and being an</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.110" end="00:28:28.140" style="s2">inquiry around what wants to emerge and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.270" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.140" end="00:28:32.730" style="s2">I think where we&#39;ve tried to orient the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:35.610" style="s2">channel in terms of the kind of subjects</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.730" end="00:28:36.800" style="s2">that we&#39;re covering and I want to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.610" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">little bit about that cuz it feels</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.800" end="00:28:43.350" style="s2">certainly glitching the matrix was</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:46.200" style="s2">really about a moment of kind of making</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.350" end="00:28:48.120" style="s2">sense of the Trump and brexit reaction</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.200" end="00:28:49.980" style="s2">the Jordan Pederson Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.120" end="00:28:53.340" style="s2">interviewers Allen&#39;s to say look there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.980" end="00:28:55.170" style="s2">two worldviews here and this one the</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.340" end="00:28:57.150" style="s2">mainstream media in particular has got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.170" end="00:28:58.560" style="s2">low-resolution version of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.150" end="00:29:01.710" style="s2">truth that is no longer fit for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.560" end="00:29:04.430" style="s2">and that was that was really then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.710" end="00:29:06.780" style="s2">done a lot of interviews around sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.430" end="00:29:09.750" style="s2">pushing back against that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.780" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">holes in the liberal worldview and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.750" end="00:29:14.760" style="s2">think that that&#39;s still a valuable</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.450" end="00:29:17.700" style="s2">perspective but I think it&#39;s also a dead</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.760" end="00:29:19.020" style="s2">end of just being and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.700" end="00:29:20.930" style="s2">people are stuck there I sort of look at</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.020" end="00:29:23.690" style="s2">the comments threads sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.930" end="00:29:27.000" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot of people that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.690" end="00:29:28.680" style="s2">still in that space and there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.000" end="00:29:31.740" style="s2">partial truth there but it&#39;s only a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.680" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">partial truth and I feel personally less</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.740" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">and less we can also talk about who in</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:38.940" style="s2">the IDW the intellectual dark web has</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.980" style="s2">become stuck in that as well but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.940" end="00:29:42.120" style="s2">a lot of people that just just want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.980" end="00:29:43.740" style="s2">kind of hear that and you can always</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.120" end="00:29:46.590" style="s2">find enough evidence that the left has</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.740" end="00:29:48.840" style="s2">gone crazy and as someone who certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.590" end="00:29:51.690" style="s2">feels politically homeless there is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.840" end="00:29:54.210" style="s2">sense that the left has gone crazy in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.690" end="00:29:56.280" style="s2">lot of ways but there&#39;s craziness on</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.210" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">both sides and if you&#39;re only seeing one</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.280" end="00:30:00.030" style="s2">side of the picture then you&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:02.340" style="s2">certainly likely to be ideologically</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.030" end="00:30:03.690" style="s2">captured on the other side I&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.340" end="00:30:05.760" style="s2">noticing certainly over the last six</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.690" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">months at least that people I know input</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.760" end="00:30:11.490" style="s2">in fairly progressive circles they know</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">how damaging identity politics is and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.490" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:18.570" style="s2">something that I&#39;m I feel an urgent need</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:20.460" style="s2">to make people aware of most sensible</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.570" end="00:30:22.169" style="s2">people in progressive circles who I know</p>

<p begin="00:30:23.489" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">so banging the drum continues to be like</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.119" end="00:30:30.929" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem particularly productive</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:32.519" style="s2">this is exactly yeah just after I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.929" end="00:30:33.869" style="s2">finished saying those last things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.519" end="00:30:37.470" style="s2">was exactly the missing piece that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.869" end="00:30:39.269" style="s2">realized that conversation I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.470" end="00:30:41.340" style="s2">seen so many people from Jamie wheel</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.269" end="00:30:42.749" style="s2">onwards who said he had his kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.340" end="00:30:45.389" style="s2">awakening moment a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.749" end="00:30:47.129" style="s2">where he&#39;s like whoa I got taken down by</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.389" end="00:30:50.309" style="s2">vitriol and hate from the left that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.129" end="00:30:50.730" style="s2">never expected to be there and I&#39;ve seen</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.730" end="00:30:55.379" style="s2">likewise time and time again so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.399" end="00:30:57.359" style="s2">feel the need to keep pushing at that at</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.379" end="00:30:59.700" style="s2">that door I&#39;m interested in where are</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.359" end="00:31:02.429" style="s2">the possibilities for synthesis with</p>

<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:21.359" style="s2">getting stuck in there because it</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.149" end="00:31:25.230" style="s2">becomes its own ideology and it also has</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.789" end="00:31:51.239" style="s2">even further into the individual story</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.950" end="00:31:54.359" style="s2">and that all of those things mix</p>

<p begin="00:32:06.779" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">different belief systems so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.480" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">talking about a lot recently in planning</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:15.359" style="s2">a lot for the autumn is how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:17.039" style="s2">this practically or how do we start</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.359" end="00:32:21.059" style="s2">experimenting with doing this</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.039" end="00:32:24.239" style="s2">practically one really useful practical</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.059" end="00:32:26.549" style="s2">tool that we have Daniel Spartanburg</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.239" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">Jordan Hall Jamie we&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.549" end="00:32:30.869" style="s2">something called ruler mega but actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:32.609" style="s2">was feeling into and wanted to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.869" end="00:32:35.009" style="s2">the kind of topology you were noticing</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.609" end="00:32:35.820" style="s2">because there&#39;s a something that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.009" end="00:32:40.380" style="s2">noticed about they</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.820" end="00:32:42.690" style="s2">is actually really nice so we could ask</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.380" end="00:32:44.160" style="s2">is it because Jamie was sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.690" end="00:32:47.400" style="s2">corner and it&#39;s literally just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.160" end="00:32:50.040" style="s2">physicality of it there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.400" end="00:32:51.570" style="s2">number of factors but it makes heaps of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.040" end="00:32:53.130" style="s2">sense it you and I have actually got to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.570" end="00:32:55.290" style="s2">have more conversations on these topics</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.130" end="00:32:58.260" style="s2">more recently than we have there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.290" end="00:33:00.630" style="s2">of an assumed knowing we didn&#39;t all get</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.260" end="00:33:03.420" style="s2">to jam before on this or prepare this</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.630" end="00:33:05.070" style="s2">this is real-time extemporaneous and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.420" end="00:33:09.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever even expressed</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.070" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">Rule Omega to Jamie but he&#39;s just doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.570" end="00:33:16.680" style="s2">it yeah and he&#39;s kind of openly</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:18.090" style="s2">inquiring into the questions that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.680" end="00:33:20.160" style="s2">really alive and it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.090" end="00:33:21.420" style="s2">easier for us to riff off with each</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.160" end="00:33:23.250" style="s2">other saying because we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.420" end="00:33:26.520" style="s2">recently shared language on these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.250" end="00:33:29.420" style="s2">and but the rule Omega is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.520" end="00:33:31.350" style="s2">really simple practical thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.420" end="00:33:37.350" style="s2">towards coherence that I would like</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.350" end="00:33:39.420" style="s2">everybody here to get is if if Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.350" end="00:33:42.180" style="s2">are talking or if you and I are talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.420" end="00:33:43.410" style="s2">like we we have this and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.180" end="00:33:47.150" style="s2">naturally have it it&#39;s worth making</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.410" end="00:33:51.660" style="s2">explicit is if you say something that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.150" end="00:33:54.450" style="s2">sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.660" end="00:33:57.840" style="s2">or wrong I actually give the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.450" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">the doubt that you might have a reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.840" end="00:34:02.130" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t understand first so rather</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:06.360" style="s2">than just default into you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.130" end="00:34:07.980" style="s2">wrong I&#39;ll ask more questions and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.360" end="00:34:09.510" style="s2">that giving the benefit of the doubt</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.980" end="00:34:13.920" style="s2">that you actually might have something</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.510" end="00:34:15.300" style="s2">useful to say increases my making sure</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.920" end="00:34:17.430" style="s2">that I understand you before I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.300" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">responding and that actually and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.430" end="00:34:20.130" style="s2">disagreeing was something that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.110" style="s2">weren&#39;t even saying because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.130" end="00:34:24.660" style="s2">seek to understand well enough creates</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.110" end="00:34:28.170" style="s2">very turbulent flow rather than laminar</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.660" end="00:34:30.300" style="s2">flow breaks down coherence right if</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.170" end="00:34:32.040" style="s2">people could just do that towards</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.300" end="00:34:34.640" style="s2">coherence if they could just give the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.040" end="00:34:39.720" style="s2">benefit of the doubt that each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.640" end="00:34:41.010" style="s2">that everyone has some signal even if</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.720" end="00:34:42.540" style="s2">it&#39;s on a very different part of reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.010" end="00:34:44.580" style="s2">than the court they&#39;re focused on and</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.540" end="00:34:47.430" style="s2">even if there&#39;s noise involved and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.580" end="00:34:50.050" style="s2">they&#39;re listening for the signal first</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.430" end="00:34:50.980" style="s2">that would change everything that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.050" end="00:34:53.110" style="s2">starting place</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.980" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">so Daniel expresses something and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.110" end="00:34:55.900" style="s2">see he&#39;s trying to express something is</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.680" style="s2">hard which by the way the rule make is</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.900" end="00:35:00.310" style="s2">designed for that kind of a thing like</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.680" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested in having</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.310" end="00:35:04.060" style="s2">conversations that aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:04.420" style="s2">trying to break new ground so okay do it</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.060" end="00:35:06.820" style="s2">dude</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.420" end="00:35:09.580" style="s2">so you expressing something hard and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.820" end="00:35:12.010" style="s2">the expression ninety-eight percent is</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.580" end="00:35:14.170" style="s2">noise and two percent is signal like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.010" end="00:35:15.790" style="s2">jazz riff but what happens is that my</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.170" end="00:35:19.270" style="s2">job is to actually do two things one</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.790" end="00:35:20.890" style="s2">hold all of it not just say it that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.270" end="00:35:22.900" style="s2">was that wasn&#39;t a hundred percent right</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.890" end="00:35:24.490" style="s2">so I&#39;m just gonna nuke it hold all of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.900" end="00:35:27.370" style="s2">then in myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.490" end="00:35:29.740" style="s2">discernment to what degree can i express</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.370" end="00:35:32.590" style="s2">something back that gets rid of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.740" end="00:35:35.980" style="s2">fifty fifty percent that is noise so now</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.590" end="00:35:37.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve got six percent signal express it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.980" end="00:35:39.820" style="s2">back and of course if he can then do</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.450" end="00:35:41.710" style="s2">that and now you three is even better a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.820" end="00:35:42.430" style="s2">more profound instrument because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.710" end="00:35:43.720" style="s2">gonna be bringing a different</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.430" end="00:35:45.700" style="s2">perspective perhaps you can take it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.720" end="00:35:47.800" style="s2">actually zoom in on it down to the poem</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.700" end="00:35:50.020" style="s2">we&#39;re actually 50% signal that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.800" end="00:35:51.550" style="s2">idea right and so one it&#39;s an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.020" end="00:35:52.870" style="s2">say hey we&#39;re trying to do something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.550" end="00:35:54.490" style="s2">hard let&#39;s all try to do something</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.870" end="00:36:02.590" style="s2">that&#39;s hard to be willing to take the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.490" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">risk of not speaking elegantly and on</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.590" end="00:36:08.980" style="s2">the premise that everyone else is doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:11.320" style="s2">their absolute level best to hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.980" end="00:36:13.360" style="s2">that which is trying to speak itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.320" end="00:36:15.700" style="s2">through you and listening in is in</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.360" end="00:36:17.650" style="s2">themselves like oh there it is tone got</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.700" end="00:36:20.110" style="s2">it there&#39;s something beautiful and clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.650" end="00:36:21.970" style="s2">there here&#39;s what I heard and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.110" end="00:36:24.730" style="s2">real Omega and there&#39;s a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.970" end="00:36:28.390" style="s2">safety that&#39;s created to be able to try</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.730" end="00:36:29.500" style="s2">out new stuff knowing that we know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.390" end="00:36:31.360" style="s2">trying out new stuff we&#39;re giving the</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.500" end="00:36:32.830" style="s2">benefit of the doubt so it actually does</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.360" end="00:36:35.770" style="s2">become more explorative and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.830" end="00:36:36.970" style="s2">you get more novelty and then I imagine</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.770" end="00:36:37.960" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if this is true for Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.970" end="00:36:39.460" style="s2">I imagine it&#39;s true for you but</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.960" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">certainly if it&#39;s true for me is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.460" end="00:36:42.820" style="s2">I&#39;m also noticing in myself like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.990" end="00:36:45.010" style="s2">constant you know when you&#39;re meditating</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.820" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">you feel this this constant chatter and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.010" end="00:36:48.850" style="s2">flow of like all the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:50.320" style="s2">going on internally that are either like</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.850" end="00:36:52.450" style="s2">certain ideas are popping up or</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.320" end="00:36:54.760" style="s2">emotional responses some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.450" end="00:36:56.200" style="s2">like social emotional responses some of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.760" end="00:36:59.110" style="s2">them are like just like I got a P and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.200" end="00:37:00.910" style="s2">like being able to actually notice all</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.110" end="00:37:03.430" style="s2">that chatter internally</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.910" end="00:37:04.690" style="s2">and do the discernment interior and say</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.430" end="00:37:07.690" style="s2">okay ball that chatter which have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.690" end="00:37:09.160" style="s2">heart that&#39;s actually signal oh but</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.690" end="00:37:10.600" style="s2">listen to all of it you have to have you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.160" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna make it goes in and out</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.600" end="00:37:15.100" style="s2">right I&#39;m listening to myself fully and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">I&#39;m listening to the to the others fully</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.100" end="00:37:19.290" style="s2">and trying to use discernment to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.690" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">continuously allow that process to turn</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.290" end="00:37:26.950" style="s2">that into gold now there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:28.990" style="s2">important distinction that we&#39;re saying</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.990" end="00:37:31.600" style="s2">that some people think about multi</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.600" end="00:37:39.990" style="s2">which is we&#39;re not saying I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.620" end="00:37:43.270" style="s2">all perspectives are equally valid and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.990" end="00:37:45.070" style="s2">I&#39;m also not saying that there is no way</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.070" end="00:37:54.130" style="s2">understanding I&#39;m saying all</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.800" end="00:37:57.730" style="s2">perspectives have some signal generally</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.130" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">have some noise and that perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.730" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">itself a reduction of information on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:05.320" style="s2">reality being perceived and that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.300" end="00:38:16.060" style="s2">out of reality to observe it in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.220" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">unitary way and if I&#39;m observing you now</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.060" end="00:38:19.930" style="s2">versus in a different state I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:20.980" style="s2">observe different things right someone</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.930" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">else at a different time if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.980" end="00:38:23.950" style="s2">observing the west side of the house</p>

<p begin="00:38:23.950" end="00:38:28.840" style="s2">the aerial view versus inside the house</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.800" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">they all give me some signal some truth</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.840" end="00:38:32.470" style="s2">about the nature of the house none of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">them give me the whole truth of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.470" end="00:38:36.280" style="s2">nature of the house because it&#39;s a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.020" style="s2">object with interior already in depth</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.280" end="00:38:41.950" style="s2">and I can&#39;t collapse it perfectly into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.020" end="00:38:44.020" style="s2">2d picture right so perspective itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.950" end="00:38:48.070" style="s2">is a reduction on information complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.020" end="00:38:49.960" style="s2">so the first part I give rule Omega to</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.070" end="00:38:52.120" style="s2">myself that my perspective has some</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.960" end="00:38:52.870" style="s2">signal but I&#39;m also positive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.120" end="00:38:54.490" style="s2">incomplete</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.870" end="00:38:56.020" style="s2">I think it&#39;s necessary to kind of put a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:38:57.280" style="s2">little flag in there and say that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.020" end="00:39:00.730" style="s2">can&#39;t do this sort of thing with</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.280" end="00:39:02.650" style="s2">everyone if people are showing up not</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.730" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">able to or not wanting to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.650" end="00:39:04.650" style="s2">that kind of dialogue I don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:06.450" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.650" end="00:39:08.309" style="s2">think you can I think you have to both</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.450" end="00:39:11.190" style="s2">parties or more than one party have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.309" end="00:39:13.309" style="s2">be willing and able and attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.190" end="00:39:15.750" style="s2">enter into the kind of inter subjective</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.309" end="00:39:18.869" style="s2">conversation but I&#39;m really struck by</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.750" end="00:39:20.819" style="s2">some of the images and analogies that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.869" end="00:39:23.460" style="s2">are used and that&#39;s the idea of the jazz</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.819" end="00:39:28.680" style="s2">riff and I&#39;m noticing that as a player</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.460" end="00:39:31.829" style="s2">in the jazz band that feeling of not</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.680" end="00:39:33.660" style="s2">being subordinated to the whole but</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.829" end="00:39:35.460" style="s2">actually somehow being supported in</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.660" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">achieving a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.460" end="00:39:41.940" style="s2">individuation is felt and it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:44.220" style="s2">there also needs to be a tolerance for</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.940" end="00:39:46.859" style="s2">ambiguity and a willingness to get messy</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.220" end="00:39:50.059" style="s2">so back to the jazz guys I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.859" end="00:39:53.279" style="s2">consistently the most righteous jams</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.059" end="00:39:56.190" style="s2">come out of kind of going you down into</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.279" end="00:39:58.260" style="s2">the mud as a band you know someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.190" end="00:40:00.210" style="s2">often doodling exploring a theme or you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.260" end="00:40:02.369" style="s2">know and it&#39;s not actually danceable</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.210" end="00:40:05.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not anything and it&#39;s even to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.369" end="00:40:07.829" style="s2">point of just unspooling entirely and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.250" end="00:40:10.740" style="s2">then some Quicksilver starlight comes</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.829" end="00:40:12.839" style="s2">out of that and you know and then it all</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.740" end="00:40:15.059" style="s2">gels and it&#39;s that patience to your</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.839" end="00:40:17.640" style="s2">point about timing Jordan you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.059" end="00:40:20.760" style="s2">the patience to let it all come undone</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.640" end="00:40:24.799" style="s2">in order to come back together in some</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:31.260" style="s2">were described cuz I mean as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.039" end="00:40:33.089" style="s2">described organisms organs and that I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.260" end="00:40:35.309" style="s2">was like oh yeah okay so social media</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.289" end="00:40:48.119" style="s2">experiencing right now and when we come</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:50.760" style="s2">when we glimpse this emergence or of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.119" end="00:40:53.160" style="s2">coherence it&#39;s sort of like oh you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.710" end="00:41:03.240" style="s2">fits perfectly with the thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.869" end="00:41:05.460" style="s2">uniquely here to do and holy I was</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.240" end="00:41:07.950" style="s2">carrying this thing it was lonely it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.460" end="00:41:09.630" style="s2">hard it was scary it was heavy but now I</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.950" end="00:41:11.099" style="s2">think that actually these pieces lay</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.630" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">down beside each other and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.099" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">actually beginning to see a picture that</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:19.410" style="s2">none of us held and none of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:21.990" style="s2">can see and that to me is like I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.410" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">how this happens but on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.990" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">we&#39;re also having people be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.250" end="00:41:26.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty damn picture let me just</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:29.220" style="s2">scribble it and snap a selfie and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.760" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">post it so the implicit morals as well</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.140" end="00:42:05.670" style="s2">beautiful thing because if you play</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.839" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">music you know kind of what that means</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.220" end="00:43:49.560" style="s2">loved an analogy that Jordan used in the</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.310" end="00:43:56.070" style="s2">we&#39;re all familiar that issue that how a</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.180" end="00:43:58.500" style="s2">supersaturated solution does a phase</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.070" end="00:44:01.320" style="s2">transition into crystallization that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.500" end="00:44:03.510" style="s2">think is the answer if you actually do</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.510" end="00:44:07.650" style="s2">effect which is to say your open source</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.980" end="00:44:10.530" style="s2">broadcast is bringing more and more</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:29.640" style="s2">scale extremely rapidly so I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.020" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">analogy there is that by disseminating</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.640" end="00:44:33.720" style="s2">this and I guess mainstreaming the</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.150" style="s2">practices well I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.720" end="00:44:38.430" style="s2">shortcut to getting there it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.190" end="00:44:46.440" style="s2">instrument so it kind of continued that</p>

<p begin="00:44:46.440" end="00:44:49.230" style="s2">dealing with all of the individual</p>

<p begin="00:44:51.780" end="00:44:57.780" style="s2">other people that defensiveness or that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:45:00.840" style="s2">our own personal stuff and it&#39;s a tool</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.780" end="00:45:02.820" style="s2">to develop I mean we&#39;ve been doing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.840" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">trained as counselors using this method</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.820" end="00:45:10.530" style="s2">done quite a lot of inquiry I I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:13.560" style="s2">definitely learning this experience and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.530" end="00:45:15.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.560" end="00:45:16.350" style="s2">better and better I guess it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.000" end="00:45:19.260" style="s2">learning to meditate or something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.350" end="00:45:21.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s something that very very very</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.260" end="00:45:23.490" style="s2">few people are actually you would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.600" end="00:45:26.100" style="s2">like good at it able to kind of achieve</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.490" end="00:45:27.780" style="s2">really transformational states but to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.100" end="00:45:30.090" style="s2">able to start doing that kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.780" end="00:45:33.150" style="s2">and and to learn to tune the instrument</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.090" end="00:45:35.910" style="s2">into what&#39;s feeling alive what&#39;s feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.150" end="00:45:38.100" style="s2">emergent in the moment is is the work to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.910" end="00:45:39.910" style="s2">be done but there&#39;s only so much that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.100" end="00:45:42.010" style="s2">can be done by too</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.910" end="00:45:43.990" style="s2">talking about it and so yeah I would say</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.010" end="00:45:45.220" style="s2">it is work but it&#39;s also play it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.990" end="00:45:47.230" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of combined there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.220" end="00:45:48.970" style="s2">fluidity to it and it&#39;s a much more it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.230" end="00:45:51.069" style="s2">a wonderful skill I think like you said</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.970" end="00:45:53.049" style="s2">it&#39;s a skill that I think we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.069" end="00:45:55.390" style="s2">forever learning so what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.049" end="00:45:57.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve planned three sessions of what</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.390" end="00:45:58.750" style="s2">we&#39;re calling the rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.250" end="00:46:00.430" style="s2">collective intelligence lab and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.750" end="00:46:02.440" style="s2">going to take place in London so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.430" end="00:46:05.289" style="s2">three evenings in October and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.440" end="00:46:07.720" style="s2">selecting a group of what we&#39;re hoping</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.289" end="00:46:09.549" style="s2">to kind of all experiment together with</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.720" end="00:46:12.130" style="s2">different practices so different</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.549" end="00:46:14.109" style="s2">modalities so from so you know we</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.130" end="00:46:15.970" style="s2">already mentioned circling meditation</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.109" end="00:46:17.349" style="s2">breath we&#39;re still developing what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.970" end="00:46:20.140" style="s2">actually gonna happen in those evenings</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.349" end="00:46:21.849" style="s2">and from that I think we&#39;ll all get a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.140" end="00:46:24.849" style="s2">sense of okay what really worked what</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.849" end="00:46:27.010" style="s2">really allowed us to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.849" end="00:46:29.559" style="s2">that went somewhere deeper and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.010" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">going to combine the conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.559" end="00:46:33.579" style="s2">the practices and the conversation might</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:35.079" style="s2">be around a topic that that&#39;s quite you</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.579" end="00:46:37.000" style="s2">know culturally punchy or difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.079" end="00:46:38.470" style="s2">discuss so that we can actually see what</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.000" end="00:46:40.240" style="s2">actually made it easier for us to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.470" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">there with each other even if we know</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.240" end="00:46:43.780" style="s2">disagree on it could we get some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:46.089" style="s2">synthesis together what practice was it</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.780" end="00:46:47.829" style="s2">we don&#39;t know yet you know we have some</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.089" end="00:46:51.039" style="s2">I have some ideas about what might work</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.829" end="00:46:53.529" style="s2">but I&#39;m also quite excited to be proven</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.039" end="00:46:55.539" style="s2">completely wrong and discover something</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.529" end="00:46:56.890" style="s2">completely new yeah and for me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.539" end="00:46:59.950" style="s2">why this feels like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.890" end="00:47:05.349" style="s2">punctuation point in the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.950" end="00:47:07.180" style="s2">the project because it&#39;s all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.349" end="00:47:09.549" style="s2">techniques and all of this collective</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.180" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">intelligence work only works when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.549" end="00:47:13.420" style="s2">pointed in a certain direction but</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:15.579" style="s2">there&#39;s there are things that we that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.420" end="00:47:17.079" style="s2">will need to be discussing so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.579" end="00:47:20.260" style="s2">conversations around hot-button</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.079" end="00:47:23.680" style="s2">political or cultural topics with this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.260" end="00:47:26.109" style="s2">as the sort of operating system is is</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.680" end="00:47:28.450" style="s2">the content so this is more about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.109" end="00:47:30.490" style="s2">form and I think that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.450" end="00:47:32.980" style="s2">journey of the channel has been</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.490" end="00:47:34.510" style="s2">increasingly sort of getting down to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.980" end="00:47:36.970" style="s2">the foundations it&#39;s like what are the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.510" end="00:47:38.980" style="s2">foundations what is required okay I</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.970" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">think this is the foundation these are</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.980" end="00:47:47.510" style="s2">the foundations and the only way to do</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:51.230" style="s2">that is to to go into it is to each of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.510" end="00:47:54.410" style="s2">do the work of finding out how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.230" end="00:47:58.280" style="s2">closed down and reopening to curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.410" end="00:47:59.660" style="s2">to openness to kind of evolutionary the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.280" end="00:48:01.790" style="s2">evolutionary current pull onto the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.660" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">better work and and trying to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.790" end="00:48:09.560" style="s2">framing it in any language that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:13.220" style="s2">too loaded in whatever way but also</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.560" end="00:48:14.990" style="s2">realizing that most modalities most</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.220" end="00:48:16.850" style="s2">languages have some signal</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.990" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">so it&#39;s extracting what is really useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.850" end="00:48:23.770" style="s2">from those from those frames and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.390" end="00:48:25.730" style="s2">from this particular sort of counseling</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.770" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">personal growth frame there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.730" end="00:48:29.630" style="s2">incredibly useful stuff that I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:31.250" style="s2">needs to become part of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.630" end="00:48:32.930" style="s2">because the reason why these</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.250" end="00:48:35.030" style="s2">conversations are breaking down is</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.930" end="00:48:38.869" style="s2">because of a neglect and I miss on and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.030" end="00:48:41.300" style="s2">and a lack of understanding of exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.869" end="00:48:43.910" style="s2">that so if anyone&#39;s interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.300" end="00:48:46.369" style="s2">we&#39;ll put the link below this video to</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.910" end="00:48:47.720" style="s2">express your interest on our website</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.369" end="00:48:49.730" style="s2">yeah I guess there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.720" end="00:48:51.560" style="s2">possibility and the hope that if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.730" end="00:48:53.780" style="s2">create something that kind of works as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.560" end="00:48:55.760" style="s2">protocol we can then roll it out</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.780" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;re always being contacted by</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.760" end="00:49:00.710" style="s2">people around the world saying we do</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">events in our cities or and perhaps if</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.710" end="00:49:03.500" style="s2">we come up with a rebel wisdom protocol</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:07.910" style="s2">that&#39;s something that we can roll out</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.500" end="00:49:10.580" style="s2">and open source that kind of information</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.910" end="00:49:12.950" style="s2">open source that that structure which</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.580" end="00:49:16.190" style="s2">leads me on to a little kind of direct</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.950" end="00:49:18.770" style="s2">appeal if you&#39;re not a subscriber or</p>
