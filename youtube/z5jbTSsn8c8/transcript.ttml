<p begin="00:00:14.460" end="00:00:18.680" style="s2">they will be made public because both</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.020" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">Ramon&#39;s and I are very big proponents of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.680" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">transparency yeah watch.watch will say</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">I&#39;m being absolutely horrific that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:31.669" style="s2">this&#39;ll be the one actually I actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:35.040" style="s2">had that I did an interview with a guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.669" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">Londo and recorded the whole thing and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">realized halfway through I was being</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">completely incoherent I had a mishap</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:43.649" style="s2">with my medicine and this thing like</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:47.129" style="s2">just always I said could we just redo</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.649" end="00:00:48.780" style="s2">that but yeah yeah I know it&#39;s nice to</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.129" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">be able to do those things I have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.780" end="00:00:52.079" style="s2">I&#39;m just like right my brain doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:53.850" style="s2">work out the time if I have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.079" end="00:00:57.390" style="s2">only when my brain works it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.850" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">work so if I&#39;m coherent half the time</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.390" end="00:01:02.039" style="s2">we&#39;re good and I&#39;m hearing in my head</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:04.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just like the filter of it coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.039" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">out through my mouth like I know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">wasn&#39;t clear like I know that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">explain the picture that&#39;s in my head</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:12.180" style="s2">but it&#39;s the best I can anyway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:14.549" style="s2">just better times to do it like in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:17.369" style="s2">mornings better for me - waking I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:51.259" style="s2">remember that we ended with transparency</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.970" end="00:01:53.640" style="s2">and how we were gonna get into that with</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.259" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">is it just left org I feel like I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.640" end="00:02:00.869" style="s2">protocol a protocol dot love it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:13.810" style="s2">that um I love the idea you only want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:16.690" style="s2">invoke voluntary transparency</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.810" end="00:02:18.190" style="s2">I have this like almost two tiered</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.690" end="00:02:20.260" style="s2">system and I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.190" end="00:02:23.230" style="s2">own shadow or theirs but I&#39;m okay with</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.260" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">my two tiered system of like organizing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.230" end="00:02:27.160" style="s2">information that&#39;s already out there for</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">governments and corporations the big</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.160" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">guys that I&#39;m like it&#39;s already their</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:32.980" style="s2">son organized capitalism in its current</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:35.470" style="s2">incarnation which has never been a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.980" end="00:02:37.090" style="s2">perfect incarnation learning about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.470" end="00:02:38.849" style="s2">capitalism in school it&#39;s like consumers</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.090" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">have perfect knowledge and externalities</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.849" end="00:02:43.150" style="s2">should be included it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:44.739" style="s2">externalities are included if you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.150" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">get away with it and consumers</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.739" end="00:02:47.890" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t have perfect knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:48.880" style="s2">we have marketing which is millions of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.890" end="00:02:52.840" style="s2">dollars thrown at us</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.880" end="00:02:54.250" style="s2">and so to know to truly know what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.840" end="00:02:56.290" style="s2">Coke stand for what is their history</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.250" end="00:02:58.150" style="s2">with with people and the environments</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.290" end="00:02:59.980" style="s2">and then be able to actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.150" end="00:03:02.860" style="s2">number and measure them so that when new</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.980" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">coke company starts you we start a new</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.860" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">one you can easily see that transparency</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:08.470" style="s2">we invoke it on their behalf because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.060" end="00:03:11.560" style="s2">think that especially for the big</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.470" end="00:03:13.360" style="s2">multinationals there isn&#39;t enough people</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:14.799" style="s2">like you and me who want to boycott the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.360" end="00:03:17.230" style="s2">bad ones that it doesn&#39;t work unless</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.799" end="00:03:20.079" style="s2">it&#39;s truly like right you can&#39;t you like</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.230" end="00:03:23.739" style="s2">very few people choose child labor</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.079" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">especially child slave labor over not if</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.739" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">they&#39;re aware of that there are things</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">that like just aren&#39;t controversial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:31.690" style="s2">just that our heads are in the sand and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.450" style="s2">anyway so that&#39;s a bit of why I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.690" end="00:03:37.120" style="s2">that like a bokken transparency on</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.450" end="00:03:39.010" style="s2">behalf of CEOs of companies like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.120" end="00:03:40.600" style="s2">what you you worked here and here and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.010" end="00:03:44.709" style="s2">these are your buddies and you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.600" end="00:03:46.359" style="s2">them a good way come on taxes isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.709" end="00:03:48.220" style="s2">interesting and want to explain that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.359" end="00:03:51.400" style="s2">little more it&#39;s different to me than</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.220" end="00:03:52.989" style="s2">like Ramon&#39;s annoyed me and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.400" end="00:03:55.900" style="s2">put all of his information out there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.989" end="00:03:57.819" style="s2">Doc&#39;s yeah right like there&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.900" end="00:03:59.650" style="s2">difference between like public</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.819" end="00:04:01.170" style="s2">information organized so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.650" end="00:04:06.069" style="s2">usable and you&#39;re held accountable</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.170" end="00:04:08.350" style="s2">versus the individual feeling safe to</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.069" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">offer their data for their and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.350" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">collective good which is a very big</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.720" end="00:04:14.200" style="s2">difference and so what are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">on them transparency mainly for the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.200" end="00:04:21.130" style="s2">other for like governments and CEOs and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:23.860" style="s2">corporations oh yeah well you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.130" end="00:04:25.450" style="s2">safe from daxing if you inherently</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.860" end="00:04:26.979" style="s2">started with vertical transparency</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.450" end="00:04:27.670" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody there&#39;s nobody anybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.979" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">can Docs you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.670" end="00:04:31.300" style="s2">is already all out there and if so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">that&#39;s the norm we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.300" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">problem anymore but uh yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:40.090" style="s2">just it I mean it&#39;s gonna take a while</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">and and I think you might be alluding to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.090" end="00:04:44.920" style="s2">the point that you my recommendation is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:47.950" style="s2">that obviously you cannot enforce</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.920" end="00:04:50.290" style="s2">transparency in a judgmental way or</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.950" end="00:04:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;re in a judgmental like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.290" end="00:04:53.950" style="s2">transparent enough and I am therefore</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.480" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">I&#39;m better like it second you start</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.950" end="00:04:57.370" style="s2">doing that you&#39;re backing the rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:59.940" style="s2">behavior so it&#39;s like as interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.370" end="00:05:01.810" style="s2">paradox where it asked us have to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.940" end="00:05:06.670" style="s2">implementing the completely voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.810" end="00:05:08.830" style="s2">way we got into government coercion</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.670" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">around transparency that wouldn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.830" end="00:05:11.440" style="s2">as good either</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">right like because if you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.440" end="00:05:17.230" style="s2">punitive if if you end up having to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:18.820" style="s2">punitive over lack of transparency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.230" end="00:05:22.900" style="s2">just yeah just creating a whole game</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.820" end="00:05:25.090" style="s2">dynamic that and that is where I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.900" end="00:05:27.790" style="s2">it is different between again the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.090" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">individual and that if we have to coerce</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.790" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">their dad out of them or trick it out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:33.670" style="s2">them it&#39;s not going to be as powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">if they automatically give it and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.670" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">only way to do that is have it be non</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:37.930" style="s2">putative have it be an invitation have</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:39.640" style="s2">it be something that they are gaining</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.930" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">something right away about their data</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.640" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">and having the transparency of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:46.780" style="s2">transparency view be transparent like</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:49.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the meta measuring yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.780" end="00:05:50.710" style="s2">how much transparency do you have or</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.210" end="00:05:53.470" style="s2">your are you operating under is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.710" end="00:05:54.820" style="s2">metric yeah for sure but yeah and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.470" end="00:05:57.490" style="s2">can&#39;t be punitive absolutely and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.820" end="00:05:58.930" style="s2">just it should be more rewards in theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.490" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">at the end like if we have enough people</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.930" end="00:06:03.790" style="s2">playing game be in this way and</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:06.280" style="s2">embracing vulnerable transparency there</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.790" end="00:06:08.530" style="s2">should be it&#39;s more of a reward in</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.280" end="00:06:10.270" style="s2">theory the market will reward you this</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.530" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">free market concept where energy will</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.270" end="00:06:14.620" style="s2">come your way people will come your way</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:16.510" style="s2">customers and partners and and the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.620" end="00:06:17.830" style="s2">ones to the really good customers the</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.510" end="00:06:21.010" style="s2">really good partners the ones you really</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.830" end="00:06:24.130" style="s2">want are the ones who are quote higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.010" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">conscious in the sense that that really</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.130" end="00:06:28.270" style="s2">again is like for me I&#39;d probably said</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:30.130" style="s2">this on the last call but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.270" end="00:06:32.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not some woowoo term that really is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.130" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">literally consciousness is in my world</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.920" end="00:06:37.510" style="s2">the ability for a being to understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:39.220" style="s2">the patterns it&#39;s involved in and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.510" end="00:06:41.050" style="s2">higher conscious beings can understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.220" end="00:06:42.550" style="s2">greater complexity in those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.050" end="00:06:44.620" style="s2">so literally we&#39;re talking about raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.550" end="00:06:46.500" style="s2">consciousness is bringing awareness to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.620" end="00:06:49.419" style="s2">the higher complexity to the hidden</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.500" end="00:06:51.849" style="s2">costs you wouldn&#39;t know where to already</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.419" end="00:06:53.590" style="s2">be aware of so really what it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.849" end="00:06:55.120" style="s2">about at the end of the day so I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.590" end="00:06:57.099" style="s2">you may have alluded to something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.120" end="00:07:00.280" style="s2">that in our last conversation that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.099" end="00:07:02.919" style="s2">touch on I don&#39;t actually kind of follow</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.280" end="00:07:05.289" style="s2">that that if you&#39;re doing things good</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.919" end="00:07:07.240" style="s2">money and Health will find you because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.289" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">actually think the universe is here to</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.240" end="00:07:11.620" style="s2">teach us exactly over here to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:14.199" style="s2">if you&#39;re here to play game a which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.620" end="00:07:15.580" style="s2">not who&#39;s here to play game a then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.199" end="00:07:17.860" style="s2">don&#39;t even like that kind of makes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.580" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">like the the positive washing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.860" end="00:07:22.180" style="s2">spirituality like just be positive then</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:26.590" style="s2">everything will work out and although</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.180" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">there&#39;s some truth there just because</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.590" end="00:07:29.830" style="s2">you&#39;re at a higher consciousness doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" end="00:07:31.030" style="s2">mean people are necessarily attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.830" end="00:07:33.460" style="s2">you and sometimes a higher conscious</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.030" end="00:07:34.509" style="s2">actually pushes people away exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.460" end="00:07:36.940" style="s2">its supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.509" end="00:07:38.530" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like to me it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.940" end="00:07:41.919" style="s2">right things happen because game a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.530" end="00:07:43.449" style="s2">rewards sociopaths game a rewards like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.919" end="00:07:44.590" style="s2">the more money you have the more money</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.449" end="00:07:45.969" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be able to put in the more</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.969" end="00:07:51.159" style="s2">everything you get and so there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.150" end="00:07:52.690" style="s2">real disparity that happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.159" end="00:07:54.580" style="s2">people get success and they&#39;re like look</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.690" end="00:07:56.740" style="s2">God told me I&#39;m supposed to be the king</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.779" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like you can&#39;t look at it you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:25.509" style="s2">to like look around it like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:27.699" style="s2">big if I truly was like okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.509" end="00:08:29.680" style="s2">fix my relationship with money that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.699" end="00:08:30.039" style="s2">really hard cuz money is the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.680" end="00:08:31.449" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.039" end="00:08:33.610" style="s2">like how money&#39;s treated how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.449" end="00:08:35.500" style="s2">circulates all of that and knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.610" end="00:08:38.500" style="s2">I can&#39;t unknow it and so I don&#39;t want it</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.500" end="00:08:41.079" style="s2">actually health I want I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.500" end="00:08:43.479" style="s2">health and at the same time it gets me</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.079" end="00:08:45.370" style="s2">my paycheck having a disability and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.479" end="00:08:47.320" style="s2">I&#39;m like subconsciously maybe I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.370" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">ready you did not have it when when</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.320" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">those things happen but at the same time</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.790" end="00:08:59.710" style="s2">and so there&#39;s that there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.710" end="00:09:01.840" style="s2">being the universe giving the lesson in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.710" end="00:09:03.430" style="s2">exactly where I am and me being like</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.990" end="00:09:10.750" style="s2">lesson was gonna be rich and healthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.460" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.750" end="00:09:14.590" style="s2">that&#39;s easy mode on game mode that those</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:15.970" style="s2">people signed up for they&#39;re here to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.590" end="00:09:17.260" style="s2">different things they&#39;re here to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.970" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">that&#39;s not where the is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.260" end="00:09:21.880" style="s2">you&#39;re here to learn from that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:23.380" style="s2">emerge together I&#39;m not here to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.880" end="00:09:24.970" style="s2">myself off of disabilities actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.380" end="00:09:26.830" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible in our current</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.970" end="00:09:29.380" style="s2">world I&#39;m here to get the world off a</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.830" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">disability like everyone has a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.380" end="00:09:32.980" style="s2">though and I think my health is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:35.140" style="s2">intimately tied to them were earth but</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.980" end="00:09:37.180" style="s2">that&#39;s like so we haven&#39;t got to talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.140" end="00:09:40.630" style="s2">about too often but it&#39;s like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.180" end="00:09:42.340" style="s2">it&#39;s logically makes sense it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.630" end="00:09:43.840" style="s2">said we&#39;re pumping into the into</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.340" end="00:09:46.270" style="s2">the world and I&#39;m a canary in the coal</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.840" end="00:09:48.040" style="s2">mine until the coal mine gets better the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.270" end="00:09:49.390" style="s2">canary dies or you take it out you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.040" end="00:09:51.820" style="s2">take me out of the earth so I need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.390" end="00:09:54.040" style="s2">make the earth better before I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.820" end="00:09:55.140" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna feel 100% I&#39;m kind of okay if</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.040" end="00:09:57.700" style="s2">that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.140" end="00:09:59.110" style="s2">like if I heal the world without not</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.700" end="00:10:01.270" style="s2">well I&#39;m okay with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.110" end="00:10:03.430" style="s2">if I get well on the way to healing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.270" end="00:10:06.070" style="s2">world I&#39;m okay with that too it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.430" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">it&#39;s empowering to have the belief so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.070" end="00:10:12.750" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have the belief and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:15.550" style="s2">what most of my yeah full transparency</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.750" end="00:10:17.530" style="s2">right there&#39;s a bunch of things to say I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.550" end="00:10:21.280" style="s2">wanted to maybe get to the essence</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.530" end="00:10:22.750" style="s2">though is there you kind of reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.280" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">in one sense of the cover state or the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.750" end="00:10:26.800" style="s2">mistake that people making quoting the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.520" end="00:10:29.800" style="s2">Bible and they say money is the root of</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.660" end="00:12:48.360" style="s2">best of the best I don&#39;t think the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:50.340" style="s2">things are in on alignment I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.360" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">our current society definitely props up</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.340" end="00:12:54.570" style="s2">people who are this that tiny fraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:13:00.540" style="s2">of Kratos distribution and so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.570" end="00:13:02.010" style="s2">and and so that in my mind the reward is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:03.900" style="s2">in and of itself that you&#39;re better at</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.010" end="00:13:05.460" style="s2">it right back in the day when we were</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.900" end="00:13:07.770" style="s2">all try and tribal and hunting and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.460" end="00:13:09.210" style="s2">gathering if you were if you were one if</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.770" end="00:13:10.770" style="s2">you were that hunter right you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.210" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">one who brings home 50 percent of meat</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.770" end="00:13:14.460" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have prestige you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:16.620" style="s2">have a little bit more meat at</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.460" end="00:13:18.899" style="s2">dinnertime probably but you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.620" end="00:13:22.050" style="s2">have 30 times the meat at dinner</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.899" end="00:13:23.639" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a little x yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.050" end="00:13:26.939" style="s2">there&#39;s a big difference between like</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.639" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">doing what so as a business as a society</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.939" end="00:13:31.529" style="s2">you want the best person at the job</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:32.819" style="s2">right you want the best hunters but in</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.529" end="00:13:35.189" style="s2">order to get the best hunters you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.819" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">actually need the numbers the ten people</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.189" end="00:13:38.790" style="s2">out of a hundred isn&#39;t the same quality</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:40.050" style="s2">as the hundred people out of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.790" end="00:13:41.639" style="s2">thousand in fact the ten people might</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:44.610" style="s2">not even make it into the hundred right</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.639" end="00:13:47.759" style="s2">so the the bigger the number the more</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.610" end="00:13:50.249" style="s2">prestigious the smaller group and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.759" end="00:13:52.290" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t like it in a very well so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.249" end="00:13:53.490" style="s2">more people you have trying hunting the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.290" end="00:13:56.009" style="s2">more likely you are to find that one</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.490" end="00:13:57.869" style="s2">hunter and also it&#39;s like being the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.009" end="00:13:59.189" style="s2">hunter is in and of itself the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.869" end="00:14:00.809" style="s2">thing if you hate hunt see then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.189" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">forced to be a hunter because you happen</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.809" end="00:14:04.499" style="s2">to be good at it that&#39;s not good for</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:06.449" style="s2">anyone but if you enjoy it its its own</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.499" end="00:14:08.399" style="s2">reward and you&#39;re bringing you get to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.449" end="00:14:10.259" style="s2">know you&#39;re the best in your group right</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.399" end="00:14:12.029" style="s2">and whatever that version is you make</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.259" end="00:14:13.350" style="s2">the best symphonies and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.029" end="00:14:15.809" style="s2">this other idea that now that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.350" end="00:14:17.519" style="s2">in a tribe anymore you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.809" end="00:14:19.829" style="s2">other tribes are part of so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.519" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">know where I give my distribution you</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.829" end="00:14:23.129" style="s2">don&#39;t know where I&#39;m gonna be the square</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.110" style="s2">root I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.129" end="00:14:27.929" style="s2">square root so I might show up and be</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.110" end="00:14:29.879" style="s2"> at most of life but that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.929" end="00:14:31.980" style="s2">place I&#39;m going to some people might not</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.879" end="00:14:35.009" style="s2">have that place so there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.980" end="00:14:39.149" style="s2">between getting the best hunter for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.009" end="00:14:42.559" style="s2">group versus getting the person into</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.149" end="00:14:45.420" style="s2">their best role and I&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.559" end="00:14:47.429" style="s2">protocol dot love has dealt with that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.420" end="00:14:48.870" style="s2">difference that instead of just getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.429" end="00:14:51.629" style="s2">the best people on the team and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.870" end="00:14:54.509" style="s2">it whether they I know right now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.629" end="00:14:57.720" style="s2">giving I would say a good 80% of what</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.509" end="00:14:59.309" style="s2">I&#39;m capable of doing 100 might kill me</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.720" end="00:15:01.370" style="s2">so I might never get to 100 but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.309" end="00:15:04.370" style="s2">doing a good 80% of what I can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.370" end="00:15:06.569" style="s2">compared to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.370" end="00:15:10.290" style="s2">especially in the ways that I show up in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.569" end="00:15:12.929" style="s2">community I would say I&#39;m average on my</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.290" end="00:15:14.549" style="s2">good day right and so below average and</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.929" end="00:15:16.110" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like but so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.549" end="00:15:17.369" style="s2">doing my preto distribution it like</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.110" end="00:15:18.869" style="s2">changing the world but they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.369" end="00:15:20.610" style="s2">that right even if they even if I tell</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.869" end="00:15:21.540" style="s2">them that they don&#39;t believe that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.610" end="00:15:23.939" style="s2">they don&#39;t you know what I mean like</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.540" end="00:15:26.040" style="s2">there&#39;s my role that I feel good that</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.939" end="00:15:28.559" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the best that I can but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.040" end="00:15:30.389" style="s2">never gonna show in any kind of metric</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.559" end="00:15:32.430" style="s2">I&#39;m probably gonna be some part I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.389" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">probably gonna be it looks</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.430" end="00:15:36.810" style="s2">like I&#39;m giving less until I give my</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">mouth right until I&#39;m 80 and like who</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.810" end="00:15:39.930" style="s2">knows what time your your purpose shows</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.640" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">of that and you&#39;re here to give your all</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.930" end="00:15:43.740" style="s2">of it like if that made sense the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:46.589" style="s2">difference seem like getting the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.740" end="00:15:47.970" style="s2">individual their highest contribution so</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.589" end="00:15:51.420" style="s2">they feel the best about themselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.970" end="00:15:53.430" style="s2">versus getting the team the group the</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.420" end="00:15:57.149" style="s2">best act and those are both important</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.430" end="00:15:58.709" style="s2">but all of society&#39;s focused like great</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.149" end="00:16:00.630" style="s2">we want the top lawyers coming to law</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.709" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">school so we can hire them instead of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.630" end="00:16:04.529" style="s2">wait how do we make sure all the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:07.050" style="s2">come out of law school can practice law</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.529" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">that they went to school for and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.050" end="00:16:12.540" style="s2">what&#39;s best for them right and best for</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:15.959" style="s2">us if they wanna be yeah yeah Lots there</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.540" end="00:16:17.820" style="s2">again so I talked about ACOG II I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.959" end="00:16:20.310" style="s2">that&#39;s how you say it it&#39;s a Chinese or</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.820" end="00:16:22.529" style="s2">Japanese picture of it on my on my</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.310" end="00:16:24.750" style="s2">desktop yeah so that&#39;s definitely the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.529" end="00:16:27.779" style="s2">goal it&#39;s which what you&#39;re good at what</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.750" end="00:16:29.190" style="s2">you love doing what the world needs and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.779" end="00:16:31.740" style="s2">then the fourth one is interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.190" end="00:16:33.959" style="s2">we talk about a game be version in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.740" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">game a version of it I think acog e even</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.959" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">changes with game game B so in game a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:41.790" style="s2">the fourth the fourth parameter is you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:43.830" style="s2">can get paid to do it yeah that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.790" end="00:16:45.450" style="s2">wait a minute that&#39;s kind of frozen rent</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.830" end="00:16:47.190" style="s2">to do it that&#39;s a little awkward when</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.450" end="00:16:53.990" style="s2">you really gain be set but I think what</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.190" end="00:16:56.250" style="s2">that is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a temporal thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.990" end="00:16:58.440" style="s2">there&#39;s only so much energy that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.250" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">know like investment and payback in an</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.440" end="00:17:02.279" style="s2">economic system so as you invest your</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:05.790" style="s2">energy it needs to return to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.279" end="00:17:08.130" style="s2">community and create the benefit within</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.790" end="00:17:09.660" style="s2">some short period of window reasonably</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:23.710" style="s2">think everyone should have a probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">have a problem with that like take some</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.710" end="00:18:27.549" style="s2">time out to grow some food you know like</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:30.249" style="s2">look out for the community and although</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.549" end="00:18:32.379" style="s2">I know I show up in my community less</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.249" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">than other people I absolutely still put</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.379" end="00:18:36.399" style="s2">in the contribution I still cook and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:38.139" style="s2">clean every you know for the meals and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.399" end="00:18:39.490" style="s2">still because I felt bad when someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.139" end="00:18:42.220" style="s2">did they were like you&#39;re a freeloader</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.490" end="00:18:45.460" style="s2">and here I was like and the piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.220" end="00:18:48.009" style="s2">that was like it was not true but there</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.460" end="00:18:50.230" style="s2">was a sliver of truth and so I felt bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.009" end="00:18:52.629" style="s2">and I was like okay what can I do and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">now when there&#39;s not a pandemic and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.629" end="00:18:56.919" style="s2">actually able to go there I clean the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:18:58.539" style="s2">yoga studio every two weeks because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.919" end="00:19:02.409" style="s2">something I can do that&#39;s within my</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.539" end="00:19:03.999" style="s2">capacity it needs to get done and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.409" end="00:19:05.710" style="s2">good about it now anyone can say i&#39;ma</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.999" end="00:19:07.119" style="s2">for you and I&#39;m like I&#39;m good I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.710" end="00:19:09.220" style="s2">tribute more of the most of the not most</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.119" end="00:19:11.769" style="s2">I know I&#39;m not in the top I&#39;m not enough</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.220" end="00:19:14.889" style="s2">course square root but I contribute</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.769" end="00:19:16.990" style="s2">average and for me that&#39;s freaking good</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.889" end="00:19:18.190" style="s2">so I&#39;m like I&#39;m good I don&#39;t care if the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.990" end="00:19:20.110" style="s2">rest of the world doesn&#39;t see it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.190" end="00:19:21.820" style="s2">good and so it&#39;s not you just have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.110" end="00:19:23.820" style="s2">have some amount of show up I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.820" end="00:19:25.899" style="s2">the little communities right you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.820" end="00:19:27.610" style="s2">never show up and cook them you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.899" end="00:19:30.970" style="s2">like but I&#39;m so important you should be</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.610" end="00:19:32.379" style="s2">cooking for me and so there&#39;s a balance</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.970" end="00:19:35.619" style="s2">between brightly you need to get your</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.379" end="00:19:39.999" style="s2">good the work that you live off in</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.619" end="00:19:41.980" style="s2">society right the the goods the services</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.999" end="00:19:43.480" style="s2">if you&#39;re getting those you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.980" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">contributing in some way that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.480" end="00:19:46.899" style="s2">benefiting from or people that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:48.249" style="s2">benefiting are benefiting from right</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.899" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">like it has to be part of something like</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.249" end="00:19:53.379" style="s2">an economy and so in that world if</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.759" style="s2">you&#39;re not an engineer if you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.379" end="00:19:57.190" style="s2">doctor if you&#39;re not suddenly you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.759" end="00:19:59.830" style="s2">totally see your value in society to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.190" end="00:20:01.990" style="s2">your essential and therefore your time</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.830" end="00:20:03.610" style="s2">would be better spent doing that than</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.990" end="00:20:05.350" style="s2">would be cooking or cleaning your</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.610" end="00:20:07.029" style="s2">cooking and cleaning with the rest of us</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.350" end="00:20:08.679" style="s2">right like no one&#39;s taking over your</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.029" end="00:20:10.659" style="s2">role here unless you&#39;re like you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.679" end="00:20:11.169" style="s2">brain surgeon thank you go do brain</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.659" end="00:20:13.929" style="s2">surgery</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.929" end="00:20:17.169" style="s2">whatever time you&#39;re able to do work</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.519" end="00:20:18.730" style="s2">you&#39;re doing the work that you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.169" end="00:20:20.169" style="s2">to do if you want to be doing everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.730" end="00:20:22.899" style="s2">the world wants you to be doing it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.169" end="00:20:24.730" style="s2">that&#39;s where we want you to be ready if</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.899" end="00:20:26.919" style="s2">we can&#39;t see that clearly then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.730" end="00:20:29.470" style="s2">you&#39;re in the field working but like ten</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.919" end="00:20:31.539" style="s2">hours a week right like not and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.470" end="00:20:33.370" style="s2">is it&#39;s not a disparaging thing it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.539" end="00:20:34.929" style="s2">like you&#39;re not a good enough artist</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.370" end="00:20:36.130" style="s2">it&#39;s like unless you&#39;re Beyonce and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.929" end="00:20:37.690" style="s2">have so many people who are like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.130" end="00:20:39.269" style="s2">willing to put in five minutes instead</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.690" end="00:20:41.289" style="s2">of you doing that so you can be Beyonce</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.269" end="00:20:43.210" style="s2">because I don&#39;t like Beyonce but</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.289" end="00:20:45.070" style="s2">Beyonce&#39;s fans like she has enough fans</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.210" end="00:20:46.450" style="s2">never support her but I probably</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.070" end="00:20:48.100" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be one of those fans I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.450" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">admire be enough contribution that I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.100" end="00:20:51.789" style="s2">would feed her right I think the tension</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:54.090" style="s2">comes in in this example you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.789" end="00:20:56.320" style="s2">is when the doctor is in med school or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.090" end="00:20:58.510" style="s2">grad school and all the things and yet</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.320" end="00:21:00.700" style="s2">they become a doctor that&#39;s the tension</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.510" end="00:21:02.110" style="s2">I&#39;m like okay so you&#39;re okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.700" end="00:21:03.309" style="s2">eventually you&#39;re gonna be good at</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.110" end="00:21:04.570" style="s2">something you&#39;re eventually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.309" end="00:21:06.190" style="s2">contribute right now you&#39;re really a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.570" end="00:21:09.610" style="s2">drain while we support your education</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.190" end="00:21:11.529" style="s2">like the actual metrics are saying you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.610" end="00:21:13.690" style="s2">you you aren&#39;t actually doing your part</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.529" end="00:21:14.919" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t seen the feedback we</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.690" end="00:21:16.870" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen the return we haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.919" end="00:21:18.460" style="s2">it come the close of the first loop when</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.870" end="00:21:19.899" style="s2">you can provide something in society and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.460" end="00:21:21.880" style="s2">you get your feedback ratings on what</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.899" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">you&#39;ve provided until we actually close</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.880" end="00:21:25.990" style="s2">that loop for the first time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:27.460" style="s2">potentially just a drain and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.990" end="00:21:29.230" style="s2">tension we get to look at and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.460" end="00:21:30.820" style="s2">that&#39;s what it but it cog II when it</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.230" end="00:21:33.460" style="s2">speaks to something you can get paid for</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.820" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s about that close that loop close</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.460" end="00:21:36.789" style="s2">that first loop of your contribution get</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:39.130" style="s2">the feedback from community in your</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.789" end="00:21:41.799" style="s2">tribe and your global economy and see if</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.130" end="00:21:43.090" style="s2">the yes the world does in fact want what</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.799" end="00:21:46.269" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it isn&#39;t something the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.090" end="00:21:49.269" style="s2">world wants and needs and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.269" end="00:21:51.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a tricky part for sure and just</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.269" end="00:21:53.889" style="s2">allowing the an ecosystem that brings</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.970" end="00:21:57.549" style="s2">transparency to all that as well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.889" end="00:22:01.059" style="s2">food so your and your what is it six or</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.549" end="00:22:03.519" style="s2">eighth year of you know post high school</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.059" end="00:22:07.179" style="s2">education to become a doctor you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.519" end="00:22:10.539" style="s2">the pressures on they decide to start</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.179" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">contributing to society that I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.539" end="00:22:12.820" style="s2">that element is important for that to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.340" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.820" end="00:22:17.290" style="s2">there&#39;s a feedback loop which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.340" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">part of like let&#39;s say you are in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.290" end="00:22:21.340" style="s2">medical school you&#39;re in your seventh</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:23.700" style="s2">year and you&#39;re like turns out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.340" end="00:22:26.350" style="s2">like blood this is maybe not the reason</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.070" end="00:23:36.790" style="s2">following in the akaki I actually I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.160" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">like the paid one because I like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.790" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying right as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:43.060" style="s2">get paid for it it changes the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">because like what if my highest calling</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.060" end="00:23:48.130" style="s2">is aren&#39;t that like a fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:49.390" style="s2">population likes I shouldn&#39;t get paid to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.130" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">do that because there&#39;s a fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.390" end="00:23:52.930" style="s2">the population and they&#39;re not gonna pay</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:54.460" style="s2">me to do it but I think I&#39;m choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.930" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">spend my time doing that there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.460" end="00:24:00.550" style="s2">value somewhere and but I still have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.260" style="s2">contribute to the everyday system like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.550" end="00:24:04.360" style="s2">still I can&#39;t pull myself out and say</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.260" end="00:24:05.740" style="s2">I&#39;m important very few people or</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.360" end="00:24:07.660" style="s2">important enough to pull themselves out</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.740" end="00:24:10.510" style="s2">in fact society basically needs to pull</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.660" end="00:24:11.650" style="s2">you out be like golden brain surgery do</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.510" end="00:24:14.380" style="s2">you like having your hands in the dirt</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.650" end="00:24:16.540" style="s2">stay here otherwise go to brain surgery</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.380" end="00:24:22.559" style="s2">that is what you&#39;re you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.540" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">what yeah so they think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.559" end="00:24:26.340" style="s2">perverse incentives that ends up showing</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">up in game a in the example of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.340" end="00:24:35.340" style="s2">medical school as I think subtly in</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">there is you will you will almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:40.169" style="s2">certainly have to burn that midnight oil</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:41.909" style="s2">stay at like push yourself way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.169" end="00:24:44.009" style="s2">your personal uses there&#39;s no way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.909" end="00:24:45.419" style="s2">you cannot become somewhat like internal</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.009" end="00:24:47.730" style="s2">and have to shut down personal</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.419" end="00:24:49.980" style="s2">relationships for certain periods of I</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.730" end="00:24:51.720" style="s2">think I&#39;m sure like so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.980" end="00:24:53.700" style="s2">are you capable of being sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.720" end="00:24:56.070" style="s2">while you are learning all these skills</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.700" end="00:24:57.659" style="s2">and like I like and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.070" end="00:24:59.850" style="s2">know if that&#39;s the right word I well I</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.659" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">tend to say it - I&#39;ve heard Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.850" end="00:25:03.570" style="s2">rotten burger use it and so I&#39;m rolling</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:06.990" style="s2">with it but you know the again the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.570" end="00:25:10.619" style="s2">object is not to Platt the you know cast</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.990" end="00:25:11.820" style="s2">judgment right on anybody who&#39;s but but</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.619" end="00:25:13.350" style="s2">but there is something in there can you</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.820" end="00:25:14.369" style="s2">disconnect from your relationships long</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.350" end="00:25:16.169" style="s2">enough can you show that your</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.369" end="00:25:18.929" style="s2">intellectual capacity in your learning</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.169" end="00:25:21.119" style="s2">capacity is such that you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.929" end="00:25:22.860" style="s2">shut off relationships in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.119" end="00:25:24.600" style="s2">pull away from perhaps things are that</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.860" end="00:25:26.220" style="s2">feel good and then are important in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.600" end="00:25:29.820" style="s2">order to prove that you are committed to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.220" end="00:25:31.860" style="s2">your intellectual brain work to</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.820" end="00:25:33.389" style="s2">contribute in this way this is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.860" end="00:25:35.669" style="s2">little subtle tasks I think that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.389" end="00:25:37.909" style="s2">throughout game a that test your</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.669" end="00:25:41.759" style="s2">willingness to disconnect from</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.909" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">relationships and do your job these</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.759" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">subtle tests and then you know so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s built in a realist triangle yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:51.330" style="s2">can you disconnect from food and sleep</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:54.029" style="s2">and still be cognitive enough to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.330" end="00:25:55.830" style="s2">function and the truth is no nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.029" end="00:25:56.999" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna be at your peak but</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.830" end="00:25:58.230" style="s2">there&#39;s times you aren&#39;t gonna be at</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.999" end="00:26:00.749" style="s2">your peak and you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.230" end="00:26:02.279" style="s2">work in that state but why we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.749" end="00:26:04.980" style="s2">train them in it like you need to work a</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.279" end="00:26:06.990" style="s2">48 hour day before you rest so that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.980" end="00:26:08.789" style="s2">know you could work 48 hour day unless</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.990" end="00:26:10.409" style="s2">there&#39;s a new pens like why is anyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.789" end="00:26:14.929" style="s2">working a 48 hour day I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.409" end="00:26:14.929" style="s2">talk during the 48 hour I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.379" end="00:26:20.460" style="s2">abuse themselves in that way yeah good</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.350" end="00:26:24.570" style="s2">thing and would that would ever think</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.460" end="00:26:26.610" style="s2">that was good did that right then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.570" end="00:26:28.710" style="s2">have an entire medical system full of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.610" end="00:26:29.999" style="s2">people I have I went to not medical</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.710" end="00:26:31.950" style="s2">school but I went to undergrad in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.999" end="00:26:34.500" style="s2">science so I went to school with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.950" end="00:26:35.720" style="s2">of doctors none of which I would choose</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.500" end="00:26:37.549" style="s2">to send my kids</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.720" end="00:26:39.559" style="s2">like none of which I would trust to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.549" end="00:26:41.480" style="s2">actually come up with solutions but they</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.559" end="00:26:42.770" style="s2">made it through med school because once</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.480" end="00:26:44.090" style="s2">you&#39;re in you&#39;re in and you pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.770" end="00:26:46.340" style="s2">funneled through unless you do something</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.090" end="00:26:48.700" style="s2">absolutely horrific at the same time as</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.340" end="00:26:51.950" style="s2">someone who has had to see many a doctor</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.700" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">there is I really wish there were more</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.950" end="00:26:55.909" style="s2">with chronic illness and mental illness</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.960" end="00:26:57.350" style="s2">because they have no compassion they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.909" end="00:27:00.860" style="s2">like well I made for med school with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.350" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">Cole that one time it&#39;s like yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.860" end="00:27:04.130" style="s2">don&#39;t have a mental illness you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">have a physical illness you don&#39;t show</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.130" end="00:27:08.120" style="s2">up with physical like no one has chronic</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.380" end="00:27:09.260" style="s2">very few people have chronic pain and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.120" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">they do have chronic pain I made it</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.260" end="00:27:12.980" style="s2">through med school and they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">even more typing but like that you have</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.980" end="00:27:15.470" style="s2">to be at your peak before you make it</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:16.730" style="s2">through and then you&#39;re guaranteed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.470" end="00:27:18.020" style="s2">make it for you just don&#39;t have empathy</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.730" end="00:27:19.880" style="s2">for other people and it&#39;s like just</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.020" end="00:27:25.190" style="s2">drink coffee if you&#39;re tired I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.880" end="00:27:31.159" style="s2">think the dynamic yeah it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.190" end="00:27:32.510" style="s2">type-a yeah that&#39;s great it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.159" end="00:27:34.299" style="s2">to be a judgment it doesn&#39;t it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.510" end="00:27:37.070" style="s2">have to use words like it&#39;s sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.299" end="00:27:38.690" style="s2">yeah this type a you&#39;re type a you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.070" end="00:27:40.220" style="s2">somebody who just like that that quick</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.690" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">feedback loop show me the shortest</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.220" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">course to how I can metric that says I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:46.880" style="s2">doing a good job and I&#39;m gonna just keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.100" style="s2">doing that thing and put my head down</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.880" end="00:27:50.419" style="s2">and charge towards it you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.100" end="00:27:53.780" style="s2">nothing wrong with that inherently</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.419" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">somebody who has that tendency um</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.780" end="00:27:57.080" style="s2">hopefully the community has the ability</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:27:58.970" style="s2">to guide them towards things that really</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.080" end="00:28:02.059" style="s2">are a major contribution to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.970" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">community and at the end of the day and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.059" end="00:28:06.320" style="s2">then you know the level of transparency</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">that the community and the greater</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.320" end="00:28:09.620" style="s2">community and the greater community and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">the greater community can operate out</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.620" end="00:28:13.970" style="s2">the more ability it is for that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:18.049" style="s2">contribution to find more complex ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.970" end="00:28:19.850" style="s2">to have a feedback loop so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.049" end="00:28:21.890" style="s2">things we talked about at the roundtable</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.850" end="00:28:26.080" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been sitting with is this</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.890" end="00:28:29.720" style="s2">difference between being assigned a task</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.080" end="00:28:32.600" style="s2">versus it naturally arising within you</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.720" end="00:28:34.039" style="s2">right like I have this idea and I want</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:35.270" style="s2">to run with it but I can&#39;t run with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.039" end="00:28:37.250" style="s2">so I need other people to come on board</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.270" end="00:28:38.419" style="s2">I basically need to give them tasks</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.250" end="00:28:41.750" style="s2">right I need to like give them homework</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.419" end="00:28:43.640" style="s2">and the the difference in that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.750" end="00:28:45.289" style="s2">there&#39;s the odd time somebody creates</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.640" end="00:28:46.520" style="s2">their own tasks and it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.289" end="00:28:48.670" style="s2">the world needs and that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.520" end="00:28:50.620" style="s2">entrepreneurship right then you get paid</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.670" end="00:28:52.540" style="s2">the world finds value in it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.620" end="00:28:54.400" style="s2">also a tons of time especially in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.540" end="00:28:55.960" style="s2">community and speaking especially about</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.400" end="00:28:57.370" style="s2">the intentional community there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.960" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">rules that need to get done like me</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.370" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">cleaning the yoga studio where it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:04.510" style="s2">like can we check off this box there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:05.890" style="s2">other people who do their mission the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.510" end="00:29:07.810" style="s2">thing that calls to them they didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.890" end="00:29:09.280" style="s2">assigned it and it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.810" end="00:29:11.020" style="s2">essential one of the people there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.280" end="00:29:14.170" style="s2">a maid not even just an amazing gardener</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.610" end="00:29:30.760" style="s2">assign someone like it has to be from</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.260" end="00:29:32.200" style="s2">with and very much needed like if they</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.760" end="00:29:34.120" style="s2">moved out we need a new one of them</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.200" end="00:29:37.120" style="s2">there&#39;s other people in the community</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.120" end="00:29:38.770" style="s2">who like do makeshift work like oh the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.120" end="00:29:40.060" style="s2">kids needed a play structure so I made</p>

<p begin="00:29:40.060" end="00:29:44.950" style="s2">this it&#39;s in actually that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.520" end="00:29:46.600" style="s2">space for it that&#39;s not sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.950" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">right thing comes up and sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.600" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">actually aunty work right it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:53.290" style="s2">now we have to take that apart now use</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:55.210" style="s2">some of our resources for this and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.290" end="00:29:56.740" style="s2">guess I&#39;m wondering how protocol that</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.210" end="00:29:58.930" style="s2">love deals with that like is there a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.740" end="00:30:00.490" style="s2">difference between we&#39;re doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.930" end="00:30:02.680" style="s2">now with mapping game B we have this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.490" end="00:30:04.030" style="s2">conversation that everybody comes into</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.680" end="00:30:05.590" style="s2">game P and it&#39;s very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.030" end="00:30:07.180" style="s2">confusing and they want to first know</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.590" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">what the hell is going on that&#39;s more of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.180" end="00:30:13.270" style="s2">like a manifesto which nobody really</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:14.560" style="s2">wants to have because then that puts a</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.270" end="00:30:16.660" style="s2">permanent right and it&#39;s like well if</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.560" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">one person writes it is it their version</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.660" end="00:30:20.800" style="s2">their manifesto we need like 50</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">manifestos in verso may I to filter it</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.800" end="00:30:24.520" style="s2">but but the bigger is like people are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:26.230" style="s2">like right what projects are going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.520" end="00:30:29.140" style="s2">what people are involved and we want the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.230" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">like directory of that and yet there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.140" end="00:30:33.700" style="s2">multiple people working on that and like</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:36.340" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.700" end="00:30:38.170" style="s2">needed we absolutely need it but also</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.340" end="00:30:39.490" style="s2">the fact that the coders are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.170" end="00:30:40.900" style="s2">making it means they&#39;re making it for</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.490" end="00:30:42.460" style="s2">themselves right they&#39;re like well this</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.900" end="00:30:44.470" style="s2">is how I would want it to be instead of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.460" end="00:30:46.090" style="s2">us instead of us getting together having</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.470" end="00:30:48.700" style="s2">a hundred all and here&#39;s what we would</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.090" end="00:30:50.680" style="s2">want in a directory and then asking who</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.700" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">does this call to who does this who</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.680" end="00:30:54.550" style="s2">wants to make this right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:56.530" style="s2">combination I&#39;ve got your boss saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.550" end="00:30:58.600" style="s2">you need to make this not it coming from</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.160" end="00:31:05.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing a solution</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:07.650" style="s2">raising this week on mapping gaming but</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.340" end="00:31:09.090" style="s2">yeah yeah every every time you you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.650" end="00:31:11.220" style="s2">you take a minute I could there&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:31:11.220" end="00:31:15.060" style="s2">I could go so so much good stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.380" end="00:31:17.370" style="s2">appreciate you know you thought on this</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.370" end="00:31:21.960" style="s2">between in there in task assignment the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.460" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">object is that everybody is equally</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.960" end="00:31:28.590" style="s2">assignee as a signer right so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:30.090" style="s2">object in other words like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.590" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">practices I do in a collective</p>

<p begin="00:31:50.610" end="00:31:56.510" style="s2">from you could find that but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.410" end="00:31:56.510" style="s2">things we do during that consultation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.850" end="00:32:02.460" style="s2">it&#39;s what we call initial team</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.050" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">accountabilities this is your first</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.460" end="00:32:08.550" style="s2">iterative cycle of working together and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:10.230" style="s2">in that what you what I recommend is you</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.550" end="00:32:12.180" style="s2">make a list of all the things we know as</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.230" end="00:32:15.600" style="s2">a team we need to get done for this</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.180" end="00:32:17.760" style="s2">project to even be meaningful in any way</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.600" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">to move us along the path towards our</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.760" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">first completed feedback loop with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:23.670" style="s2">greater economy so we can see how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:25.170" style="s2">doing how are we doing something good</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.670" end="00:32:27.680" style="s2">that the people want us to do or is this</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.170" end="00:32:27.680" style="s2">a stupid idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.710" end="00:32:33.720" style="s2">and yeah so in that so enlisting the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.230" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">accountabilities generically is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.720" end="00:32:38.160" style="s2">first step detach yourself detach</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:39.690" style="s2">anybody&#39;s roles a lot of times people</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.160" end="00:32:40.950" style="s2">want to jump right into the roles oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.690" end="00:32:42.360" style="s2">gonna work on this and I&#39;m gonna work on</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.140" end="00:33:03.810" style="s2">until phase C you know whatever there</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.120" end="00:33:06.030" style="s2">you go right so so being in feedback</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.810" end="00:33:08.820" style="s2">being a conversation so you as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.030" end="00:33:10.950" style="s2">assignor having the respect of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:28.110" style="s2">you can&#39;t get paid for it the temporal</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.130" end="00:33:30.419" style="s2">space is not there yet to say this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.110" end="00:33:32.730" style="s2">the time we need that service to create</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.419" end="00:33:36.659" style="s2">a to complete a feedback loop it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.730" end="00:33:38.940" style="s2">not there yet so he has both roles so</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.340" end="00:36:24.510" style="s2">the offering that you have within some</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.470" end="00:36:26.130" style="s2">reasonable temporal space of getting a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.510" end="00:36:28.950" style="s2">feedback loop that would say yes what it</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.130" end="00:36:30.660" style="s2">like if you&#39;re something really good but</p>

<p begin="00:36:37.890" end="00:36:44.340" style="s2">what credit is okay so something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.010" end="00:36:45.570" style="s2">Wikipedia that nobody very people mostly</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.340" end="00:36:47.490" style="s2">aren&#39;t willing to pay for they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.570" end="00:36:49.650" style="s2">their people do give they make it more</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.490" end="00:36:51.210" style="s2">than enough money but most of us don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.650" end="00:36:53.010" style="s2">pay for it right most of us are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.210" end="00:36:55.350" style="s2">willing to pay for a free wiki for free</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.010" end="00:36:59.100" style="s2">encyclopedia even though it&#39;s essential</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.350" end="00:37:00.510" style="s2">to our lives is this a way to funnel</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.100" end="00:37:02.330" style="s2">money towards those things because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.510" end="00:37:05.910" style="s2">have a lot of yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.330" end="00:37:09.150" style="s2">okay because there is also the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.910" end="00:37:10.680" style="s2">like especially in technology creating</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.150" end="00:37:12.810" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s gonna be lucrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.680" end="00:37:15.180" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna work for 90% of the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.810" end="00:37:18.150" style="s2">right like like the Facebook&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.180" end="00:37:19.770" style="s2">that type of stuff that most people</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.150" end="00:37:21.480" style="s2">would never pay for a Facebook now that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.770" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">we&#39;ve had it for free even though</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.480" end="00:37:25.890" style="s2">they&#39;re of course paying for Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re all paying for it can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.890" end="00:37:31.470" style="s2">use that another way my issue with once</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.440" end="00:37:33.600" style="s2">you start incentivizing people in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.470" end="00:37:35.490" style="s2">monetary fashion they find the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.600" end="00:37:37.020" style="s2">lucrative positions so they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.490" end="00:37:38.520" style="s2">likely to go and work for the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.020" end="00:37:40.440" style="s2">project that&#39;s gonna be more lucrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.520" end="00:37:42.870" style="s2">then let&#39;s say a niche project that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.440" end="00:37:44.340" style="s2">helps one in it one in</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.870" end="00:37:45.930" style="s2">10,000 people but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.340" end="00:37:47.790" style="s2">life-changing because they absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.930" end="00:37:49.770" style="s2">need this technology there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.790" end="00:37:51.330" style="s2">market for that technology but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.770" end="00:37:56.100" style="s2">world-changing for a tiny group of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.330" end="00:37:59.880" style="s2">people does it value that does it value</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.100" end="00:38:01.860" style="s2">the impact of it but like there&#39;s impact</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.880" end="00:38:03.090" style="s2">for 90% of the population right you help</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.860" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">people eat better that&#39;s going to help</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.090" end="00:38:07.590" style="s2">everyone versus hey you&#39;re allergic to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:09.000" style="s2">99% of the stuff we made a food</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.590" end="00:38:10.830" style="s2">supplement that doesn&#39;t have any of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.000" end="00:38:12.660" style="s2">in it right only one in a million people</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.830" end="00:38:14.850" style="s2">needs it but they will die without it</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.660" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">like those are very there clearly isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.850" end="00:38:17.910" style="s2">money really in the second option if</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">it&#39;s one in a million people there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.910" end="00:38:21.540" style="s2">only money in the first so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:22.680" style="s2">concentrates on the one where anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.540" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">could make you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.680" end="00:38:30.630" style="s2">dietary stuff for the world this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:32.340" style="s2">about the biggest impact right so one</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.630" end="00:38:34.230" style="s2">thing I think we&#39;ve we touched on this a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.340" end="00:38:36.300" style="s2">couple of the points that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.230" end="00:38:38.580" style="s2">make clear is that you know supply and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.300" end="00:38:40.770" style="s2">demand is just a real natural phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.580" end="00:38:42.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a like like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.770" end="00:38:45.690" style="s2">people think supplying to manage some</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.980" end="00:38:48.290" style="s2">construct invented by capitalism to for</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.690" end="00:38:51.510" style="s2">them to take advantage of the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.290" end="00:38:53.130" style="s2">your bike successful capitalists but</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.510" end="00:38:54.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s you know my belief is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.130" end="00:38:56.130" style="s2">supply and demand is just a natural</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.510" end="00:38:58.980" style="s2">phenomenon where there is demand for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.130" end="00:39:00.450" style="s2">thing much more of energy will go</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.980" end="00:39:02.370" style="s2">towards anybody who can provide that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.450" end="00:39:04.620" style="s2">thing like lots of attention and value</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.370" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">and an interest is gonna be if you if</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.620" end="00:39:09.150" style="s2">you can be somebody who provides that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:11.400" style="s2">thing and if there is not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.150" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">demand for a thing and there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.400" end="00:39:15.420" style="s2">supply nobody really cares somebody</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:20.010" style="s2">values it as much as abundant and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.420" end="00:39:22.470" style="s2">everywhere and you know okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.010" end="00:39:25.820" style="s2">just so when you are offering something</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.470" end="00:39:29.250" style="s2">that is low supply and high demand</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.820" end="00:39:32.070" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find perhaps that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.250" end="00:39:33.750" style="s2">have to exert as much work as the next</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.070" end="00:39:36.120" style="s2">guy who&#39;s doing something that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.750" end="00:39:45.020" style="s2">greater supply and less demand or both</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.120" end="00:39:47.510" style="s2">right and you know your willingness so</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.020" end="00:39:50.420" style="s2">so for there to be a built-in natural</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.510" end="00:39:52.070" style="s2">incentive towards helping to provide the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.420" end="00:39:54.620" style="s2">things that there&#39;s high demand for and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.070" end="00:39:56.540" style="s2">lower supply you want to have a natural</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.620" end="00:40:01.340" style="s2">attractor field that the help if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.540" end="00:40:03.980" style="s2">come in and up create that thing so game</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.340" end="00:40:06.530" style="s2">a has a pretty good system for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.980" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">right the supply and demand are of right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.530" end="00:40:11.000" style="s2">if you if there is a high need for</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:12.710" style="s2">something and a low supply then you get</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.000" end="00:40:14.570" style="s2">in and you get monopolize that market</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.710" end="00:40:17.960" style="s2">until you get competition right and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.570" end="00:40:20.600" style="s2">so the place is that like food we all</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.960" end="00:40:22.220" style="s2">need that are saturated right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.600" end="00:40:24.080" style="s2">really hard to make a lot of money there</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.220" end="00:40:25.910" style="s2">becomes the best cracker well good luck</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.080" end="00:40:28.820" style="s2">competing with Nabisco and all them</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.910" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">right so but if you come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.820" end="00:40:31.640" style="s2">peanut free sugar free</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:33.050" style="s2">blah-blah-blah-blah-blah free cracker</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.640" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">that&#39;s for this very nice group of</p>

<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:39.740" style="s2">have a market and so they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.120" end="00:40:41.240" style="s2">to touch that market until you prove</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.740" end="00:40:42.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s lucrative and then they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.240" end="00:40:44.150" style="s2">like oh we do like gluten-free</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.680" end="00:40:47.060" style="s2">everyone&#39;s getting gluten free we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.150" end="00:40:50.330" style="s2">make a gluten-free cracker my issue with</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.060" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">that is game a that it only like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.330" end="00:40:53.300" style="s2">whole incentive gives us what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:55.250" style="s2">currently have that there&#39;s high</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.300" end="00:40:57.320" style="s2">competition in those demands which you</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.250" end="00:41:00.140" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s not the best for me the user</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.320" end="00:41:02.900" style="s2">but I have a lot of I pay a high price</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.140" end="00:41:06.590" style="s2">to have the high level of choice in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.900" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">marketplace yes if instead we owned the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.590" end="00:41:09.740" style="s2">cracker company if instead we were like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:10.940" style="s2">right how many crackers do we need and</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.740" end="00:41:12.590" style="s2">how can we make it as efficiently as</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.940" end="00:41:14.660" style="s2">possible there&#39;s a very big difference</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.590" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">there and it happens in technology as</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.660" end="00:41:21.080" style="s2">well so what speaking to there is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:22.940" style="s2">that is the economic paradigm of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.080" end="00:41:25.100" style="s2">haves and have-nots more so right in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.940" end="00:41:26.900" style="s2">power pyramid so what we end up seeing</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.100" end="00:41:29.480" style="s2">is those at the top top the power</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.900" end="00:41:32.450" style="s2">pyramid get to say oh I see what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.480" end="00:41:34.070" style="s2">world needs and then they&#39;re gonna lose</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.450" end="00:41:37.610" style="s2">lots of capital investment to create</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.070" end="00:41:39.950" style="s2">that thing and then they have to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.610" end="00:41:42.140" style="s2">you want that thing there their perverse</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.950" end="00:41:44.840" style="s2">incentive in the system here is to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.140" end="00:41:46.340" style="s2">you want that thing if it whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.840" end="00:41:48.500" style="s2">takes offering you consumer credit</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.340" end="00:41:50.600" style="s2">putting ads on TV putting ads on</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.500" end="00:41:52.070" style="s2">Facebook like jamming this thing down</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.600" end="00:41:53.390" style="s2">your throat until enough people want the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.070" end="00:41:56.000" style="s2">thing so you can have a return on your</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.390" end="00:41:58.400" style="s2">capital investment so the large capital</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.000" end="00:42:00.530" style="s2">investment was not</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.400" end="00:42:04.610" style="s2">so if this problem is solved right in</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.530" end="00:42:07.340" style="s2">think with things like the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.610" end="00:42:12.200" style="s2">crowdfunding right this solves this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.340" end="00:42:14.510" style="s2">problem like like to me game be released</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.200" end="00:42:17.510" style="s2">literally created and infused into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.510" end="00:42:20.180" style="s2">economy using that exact methodology the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.510" end="00:42:22.010" style="s2">crowdsource so you are given a ubi and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.180" end="00:42:23.810" style="s2">not only can you buy your basics like</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.010" end="00:42:25.190" style="s2">food and shelter but what it was like in</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.810" end="00:42:27.020" style="s2">the long term what things would you like</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.190" end="00:42:29.300" style="s2">to exist no use some of your newly</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.020" end="00:42:31.430" style="s2">created capital to invest in things that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.300" end="00:42:33.110" style="s2">you actually want reverse that pyramid</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.430" end="00:42:34.220" style="s2">around instead of people guessing what</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.110" end="00:42:35.480" style="s2">they think you should want and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.220" end="00:42:37.430" style="s2">trying to jam it down your throat</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.480" end="00:42:39.530" style="s2">actually get the feedback the real</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.430" end="00:42:43.220" style="s2">feedback mechanism from the bottom part</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.530" end="00:42:45.650" style="s2">of the pyramid right from what what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.220" end="00:42:47.480" style="s2">it that you want and what can we do for</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.650" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">you so we just take that pyramid we loop</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.480" end="00:42:51.590" style="s2">the whole thing reckon around do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:55.160" style="s2">makes a little fractal like amazing</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.590" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">beautiful natural flow pattern besides</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.160" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">the price so I&#39;ve started something</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:03.580" style="s2">under protocol that love we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:09.710" style="s2">white it&#39;s my favorite go there</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.580" end="00:43:12.110" style="s2">supplement neuro brain so you know like</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.710" end="00:43:13.790" style="s2">how does how do we know the price of it</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.110" end="00:43:16.730" style="s2">how do we know whether it&#39;s it&#39;s 2 bucks</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.790" end="00:43:18.440" style="s2">a pill 10 cents a pill is it them that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.730" end="00:43:22.280" style="s2">decides it and they price it it&#39;s planes</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.440" end="00:43:24.860" style="s2">man do you want the answer in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.280" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">the trans transitionary system or do you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.860" end="00:43:35.750" style="s2">want the answer in terms like pure game</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:38.260" style="s2">B when we&#39;re all like in it well in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.750" end="00:43:42.650" style="s2">pure game B environment the way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.260" end="00:43:44.750" style="s2">looked at this so during the transition</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.650" end="00:43:46.910" style="s2">system in a collective foundational</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.750" end="00:43:49.400" style="s2">document one of the things we do is the</p>

<p begin="00:44:07.940" end="00:44:12.200" style="s2">to follow that train of thought but so</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.100" end="00:44:13.849" style="s2">until we identify the mission</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.430" end="00:46:04.910" style="s2">something that an individual some living</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.369" end="00:46:07.250" style="s2">being values mm-hmm every current if</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.910" end="00:46:10.069" style="s2">it&#39;s built on the vast something that an</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.250" end="00:46:13.190" style="s2">individual being values or your</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.069" end="00:46:14.540" style="s2">individual beings value that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.190" end="00:46:16.579" style="s2">we&#39;re after that&#39;s what we want more of</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.540" end="00:46:18.680" style="s2">for hey that&#39;s what we wanted it</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.579" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">identify the needs identifies what what</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.680" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">is valued and where the needs are and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:24.049" style="s2">then has a way to create have those</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.569" style="s2">things he created in a system</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.049" end="00:46:29.509" style="s2">and to do that as clearly as possible is</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.569" end="00:46:31.189" style="s2">the object and then person so in the in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.509" end="00:46:33.319" style="s2">the pure game be we don&#39;t need the money</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.189" end="00:46:35.569" style="s2">thing there at all</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.319" end="00:46:37.029" style="s2">I think yeah I mean transparency helps</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.569" end="00:46:40.069" style="s2">with a lot of it because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.029" end="00:46:41.809" style="s2">openly transparent about how how and why</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.069" end="00:46:44.390" style="s2">you&#39;re creating that drug right that</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.809" end="00:46:46.130" style="s2">pill what went into it why is it there</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.390" end="00:46:47.809" style="s2">if you&#39;re transparent about all that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.130" end="00:46:49.640" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna see it cost you a dollar to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.809" end="00:46:51.499" style="s2">make the pill so you selling it for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.640" end="00:46:53.179" style="s2">dollar 10 it&#39;s all there 25 makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.499" end="00:46:55.729" style="s2">like why would you sell it pretty less</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.179" end="00:46:58.249" style="s2">than that I&#39;ll give you a dollar 50 I</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.729" end="00:47:00.259" style="s2">really really need this if I then come</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.249" end="00:47:02.059" style="s2">in there and I&#39;m like wait why are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.259" end="00:47:03.709" style="s2">sourcing this here when it&#39;s not ethical</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.059" end="00:47:06.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s expensive and you can source it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.709" end="00:47:10.910" style="s2">like if I can view how to make it go</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.679" end="00:47:16.579" style="s2">from a dollar to ninety cents but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.910" end="00:47:17.809" style="s2">not part of that company do can I and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.579" end="00:47:19.219" style="s2">I can tell them out and they can bring</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.809" end="00:47:20.839" style="s2">it down they don&#39;t have to pass that</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.219" end="00:47:23.269" style="s2">cost on a consumer but if I create a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.839" end="00:47:25.369" style="s2">competitor I could make it for ninety</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.269" end="00:47:27.650" style="s2">cents no I can I can make it for less</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.369" end="00:47:30.079" style="s2">and I&#39;m transparent about that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.650" end="00:47:32.329" style="s2">gonna cost society to have two people</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.079" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">one making it for ninety cents and one</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.329" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">making it for a dollar that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:37.759" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna in fact now we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:39.349" style="s2">there at a dollar five and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.759" end="00:47:40.819" style="s2">ninety-five cents right because it cost</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.349" end="00:47:42.439" style="s2">me more to have that competition you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.819" end="00:47:44.059" style="s2">know now we&#39;re competing for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.439" end="00:47:47.449" style="s2">minerals are competing for all of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.059" end="00:47:49.969" style="s2">how so in your game be world</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.449" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">what does if I have a new ingenious idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.969" end="00:47:55.459" style="s2">to improve an existing product whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.249" style="s2">that improvement looks like do I create</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.459" end="00:48:00.529" style="s2">a competitor or do I go to them and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.249" end="00:48:02.089" style="s2">do it and if they say yes I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.529" end="00:48:04.219" style="s2">a no-brainer but if they say no we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.089" end="00:48:07.249" style="s2">actually don&#39;t like that what are my</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.219" end="00:48:09.380" style="s2">options right I think it boils down to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.249" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">rivals behavior right I think both the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.380" end="00:48:12.949" style="s2">act of you saying hey get so first of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:15.439" style="s2">all one of the things I encourage in to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.949" end="00:48:16.400" style="s2">collect the foundational document again</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.439" end="00:48:18.130" style="s2">which is like the Articles of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.400" end="00:48:23.709" style="s2">Incorporation me to lean business plan</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.130" end="00:48:24.979" style="s2">is that you have the path towards</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.709" end="00:48:26.809" style="s2">influence</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.979" end="00:48:28.789" style="s2">okay so influence currency is another</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.809" end="00:48:31.549" style="s2">one of the currency categories the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.789" end="00:48:34.039" style="s2">protocol that love recognizes in in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.549" end="00:48:36.289" style="s2">currency is like kind of the number of</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.039" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">votes you have on a given council which</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.289" end="00:48:38.630" style="s2">is a give</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">council stewards a certain set of assets</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.630" end="00:48:46.860" style="s2">so as you show to me over time to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:48.750" style="s2">wise steward and expert steward your</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.860" end="00:48:50.280" style="s2">influence and theory ought to go up over</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.750" end="00:48:52.590" style="s2">the particular assets</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.280" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">that&#39;s your stewarding as your wise and</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.590" end="00:48:56.550" style="s2">expert in stewarding this asset your</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:58.380" style="s2">influence ought to go up as compared to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.550" end="00:49:01.410" style="s2">everybody else right so there should be</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.380" end="00:49:03.630" style="s2">always be a path so here&#39;s how you gain</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.410" end="00:49:04.920" style="s2">influence currency over these assets in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.630" end="00:49:06.540" style="s2">a fully transparent way one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.920" end="00:49:08.370" style="s2">things we answer on the document is</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.540" end="00:49:09.510" style="s2">here&#39;s the current influence currency</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.370" end="00:49:11.580" style="s2">holdings as we&#39;re going to instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.510" end="00:49:13.320" style="s2">this collective and here&#39;s the path for</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.580" end="00:49:15.390" style="s2">others to earn influence in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.320" end="00:49:17.250" style="s2">stewardship of the assets so in other</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.390" end="00:49:19.470" style="s2">words in order to have it have your a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.250" end="00:49:21.900" style="s2">good idea be heard you would there would</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.470" end="00:49:24.030" style="s2">be a path for you that if you&#39;re that if</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.900" end="00:49:25.560" style="s2">you&#39;re sure enough that you can go on</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.030" end="00:49:26.670" style="s2">that path and eventually reach the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.560" end="00:49:28.740" style="s2">where you can say hey guys I have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.670" end="00:49:33.180" style="s2">idea to lower costs on the product and</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.740" end="00:49:35.370" style="s2">be heard in that for that path not to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.180" end="00:49:38.490" style="s2">there or for a resistance to your input</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.370" end="00:49:41.630" style="s2">to be there his rival risk behavior for</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.490" end="00:49:45.510" style="s2">I would say at least right for you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.630" end="00:49:47.340" style="s2">then receive that no and then go start a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.510" end="00:49:51.150" style="s2">competitive company is also rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.340" end="00:49:53.130" style="s2">behavior I would say right and so when</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.150" end="00:49:54.330" style="s2">we see rivalries behavior in the system</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.130" end="00:49:56.670" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see costs go up we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.330" end="00:49:59.070" style="s2">going to see less efficiency inherently</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.670" end="00:50:02.010" style="s2">and so you know the theory of protocol</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.070" end="00:50:04.110" style="s2">love is with this greater transparency</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.010" end="00:50:08.220" style="s2">we will be able to algorithmically</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.110" end="00:50:10.440" style="s2">identify rivals behavior and I think if</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.220" end="00:50:12.030" style="s2">we can do that we can have just all</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.440" end="00:50:14.040" style="s2">these amazing conversations with people</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.030" end="00:50:15.630" style="s2">where we see the behavior popping up and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.040" end="00:50:17.460" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to be in judgment humans</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.630" end="00:50:19.890" style="s2">are human e we&#39;re gonna do rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.460" end="00:50:21.810" style="s2">things we&#39;re gonna do all good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.890" end="00:50:23.630" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do all they&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.810" end="00:50:25.380" style="s2">negative things we&#39;re gonna do all be</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.630" end="00:50:27.210" style="s2">sociopathic to some extent we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.380" end="00:50:29.100" style="s2">gonna be selfish to some extent and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.210" end="00:50:31.620" style="s2">we just want a system that helps create</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.100" end="00:50:33.540" style="s2">balance and does not reward those</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.620" end="00:50:35.610" style="s2">perverse incentivize things and that are</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.540" end="00:50:37.200" style="s2">in game a that prefers from Seneca these</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.610" end="00:50:39.300" style="s2">behaviors sociopathic and selfishness</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:41.010" style="s2">and looking at the short term is that a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.300" end="00:50:42.570" style="s2">long term and looking at the game for me</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.010" end="00:50:44.370" style="s2">and mine rather than the game for</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.570" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">everybody like these are perverse</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.370" end="00:50:50.040" style="s2">incentives built into game a and we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">we can change that in theory right</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.040" end="00:50:54.570" style="s2">yeah absolutely and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:56.250" style="s2">important like you can&#39;t just squash out</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.570" end="00:50:58.170" style="s2">the rival or as part of people me like</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.250" end="00:50:59.580" style="s2">that&#39;s not welcome at the table and like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.170" end="00:51:02.610" style="s2">it&#39;s very much part of our human</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.580" end="00:51:04.680" style="s2">existence to how even if you absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.610" end="00:51:08.100" style="s2">want game be there&#39;s still rival errs</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.680" end="00:51:10.500" style="s2">rifle risk behavior within you of course</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.100" end="00:51:12.090" style="s2">and especially having grown up in a game</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">a world the more I think we raise</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.090" end="00:51:16.590" style="s2">children in a game be in a transition to</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:17.730" style="s2">game be world the less rival risk I</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.590" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">don&#39;t think they ever get to zero</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.730" end="00:51:22.110" style="s2">rivalry nor should we</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.850" style="s2">this has been such a mystery to me you</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.110" end="00:51:25.230" style="s2">have kids like it seems like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.850" end="00:51:27.660" style="s2">noticed I don&#39;t know where they get it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.230" end="00:51:30.560" style="s2">kids start fighting over toys and trying</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.660" end="00:51:32.730" style="s2">to possess things yeah like age of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.560" end="00:51:35.670" style="s2">eighteen months or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.730" end="00:51:37.260" style="s2">there or younger even they&#39;re just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.670" end="00:51:39.210" style="s2">this is a daring thing I want this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.260" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">mine I want to control that thing so</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.210" end="00:51:43.050" style="s2">it&#39;s so inherent something&#39;s in some</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.790" end="00:52:44.310" style="s2">twist but it really is the key I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:46.740" style="s2">to me that people really are glad to see</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.310" end="00:52:49.890" style="s2">people have access to more resources and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.740" end="00:52:51.390" style="s2">become what we would consider wealthy in</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.090" end="00:53:12.030" style="s2">grandchildren become so wealthy that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.470" end="00:53:14.790" style="s2">they become the elite class that rules</p>

<p begin="00:53:16.650" end="00:53:21.390" style="s2">game be world but are there Elon Musk&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.440" end="00:53:23.880" style="s2">and Bill Gates and what is their</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.390" end="00:53:25.260" style="s2">difference between somebody who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.880" end="00:53:26.550" style="s2">mediocre gets their ubi</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.260" end="00:53:28.020" style="s2">and what&#39;s the difference between them</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.550" end="00:53:29.700" style="s2">and somebody with like a disability who</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.020" end="00:53:32.220" style="s2">can&#39;t contribute in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.700" end="00:53:34.170" style="s2">would have that the same metrics and all</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.220" end="00:53:36.300" style="s2">their continuing their highest point but</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.170" end="00:53:39.300" style="s2">they&#39;re not contributing at the level</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.300" end="00:53:40.590" style="s2">that societies there might not be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.300" end="00:53:42.420" style="s2">society to say and this is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.590" end="00:53:44.340" style="s2">equivalent what&#39;s not but there still is</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.420" end="00:53:46.680" style="s2">a metric saying you&#39;re not contributing</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.340" end="00:53:48.390" style="s2">as much there is this Elon Musk and Bill</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.680" end="00:53:52.200" style="s2">Gates who have all these amazing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.390" end="00:53:54.030" style="s2">let&#39;s like even if no corruptions</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.200" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">involved they&#39;re just an individual with</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.030" end="00:53:58.980" style="s2">frado&#39;s distribution they are that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:01.410" style="s2">top two let&#39;s assume that still needs me</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.980" end="00:54:03.390" style="s2">llamas the top inventors right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.410" end="00:54:06.900" style="s2">gonna create hundreds and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.390" end="00:54:10.140" style="s2">things in their lifetime how are they</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.900" end="00:54:13.320" style="s2">incentivized and why is I and what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.140" end="00:54:15.420" style="s2">the disparity yeah we keep talking that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.320" end="00:54:18.030" style="s2">parade oh I think wasn&#39;t parade at this</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.420" end="00:54:20.850" style="s2">point 80/20 you know things always fall</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.030" end="00:54:22.560" style="s2">into an 80/20 I go I don&#39;t know if Bray</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.850" end="00:54:23.970" style="s2">knows also 80/20 I just heard Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.560" end="00:54:26.550" style="s2">Peterson talk about the square root does</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.970" end="00:54:28.020" style="s2">half of it and yeah the 80/20 rule works</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.550" end="00:54:29.580" style="s2">for me in my brain twenty percent of</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.020" end="00:54:33.619" style="s2">people to 80 percent of the results it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.580" end="00:54:35.910" style="s2">even oh yeah so if Pareto if Pareto&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.619" end="00:54:37.500" style="s2">theory is true here in that there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.910" end="00:54:38.820" style="s2">kind of this twenty percent of us is</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.500" end="00:54:40.950" style="s2">going to be kind of the rulers of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.820" end="00:54:43.890" style="s2">eighty percent okay that&#39;s they like to</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.950" end="00:54:50.040" style="s2">mean it sounds fairly reasonable my</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.890" end="00:54:51.300" style="s2">rulers good thank you thank you for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.040" end="00:54:52.950" style="s2">correction I met leaders they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.300" end="00:54:54.480" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of leading twenty percent</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.950" end="00:54:56.460" style="s2">will be lead the eighty percent and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.480" end="00:54:57.930" style="s2">a very natural selection where the</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.460" end="00:55:00.119" style="s2">eighty percent is glad to have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.930" end="00:55:02.760" style="s2">twenty percent leading right perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.119" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a natural balance for for</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.760" end="00:55:06.990" style="s2">humanity and I think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:08.700" style="s2">Pareto would theorize on that then of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.990" end="00:55:13.290" style="s2">course we have something more like you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.700" end="00:55:17.100" style="s2">know 0.000000 one percent that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.290" end="00:55:18.660" style="s2">very strongly ruling that easily</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.100" end="00:55:21.240" style="s2">do they get a little bit of more meat at</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.660" end="00:55:23.880" style="s2">the dinner table like the best hunter I</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.240" end="00:55:27.330" style="s2">think generally um like I said before</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.880" end="00:55:30.570" style="s2">people seem to be glad for certain of us</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.330" end="00:55:33.090" style="s2">to have access to more resources which</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.570" end="00:55:34.290" style="s2">is greater well right it&#39;s like hey</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.090" end="00:55:35.610" style="s2">thank you for making the world a better</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.290" end="00:55:40.740" style="s2">place for all of us yeah we&#39;re glad to</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.610" end="00:55:42.660" style="s2">see you be able to enjoy what it is if</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.740" end="00:55:44.370" style="s2">you have four yachts no I&#39;m in no Camry</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.660" end="00:55:45.960" style="s2">with that not as long as anyone starving</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.370" end="00:55:48.690" style="s2">but if you&#39;re a Elon Musk and you get</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.960" end="00:55:51.060" style="s2">first access to resources that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.690" end="00:55:52.980" style="s2">able to then invent with yeah I want the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.060" end="00:55:54.390" style="s2">top inventors having access to that so</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.980" end="00:55:56.370" style="s2">they can come up with the top inventions</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.390" end="00:55:57.930" style="s2">but I don&#39;t know who the top inventor is</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.370" end="00:56:00.650" style="s2">that lets the brain or distribution</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.930" end="00:56:03.630" style="s2">giving everyone some access right it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.650" end="00:56:05.820" style="s2">so company like you&#39;ve shown that</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.630" end="00:56:06.990" style="s2">through a feedback loop you do provide</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.820" end="00:56:09.270" style="s2">something good for society</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.990" end="00:56:10.770" style="s2">we&#39;re like thank you get blasted like</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.270" end="00:56:13.140" style="s2">their first their first successful</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.770" end="00:56:16.980" style="s2">venture whatever for Elon was paid out</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.140" end="00:56:18.630" style="s2">for Bill Gates it was Microsoft DOS</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.980" end="00:56:21.570" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.630" end="00:56:25.740" style="s2">and so yeah you&#39;ve provided this great</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.570" end="00:56:29.910" style="s2">value thank you and so it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.740" end="00:56:32.280" style="s2">for it not to go to your head Wow what a</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.910" end="00:56:34.290" style="s2">great value creator I am for when you</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.280" end="00:56:36.090" style="s2">get first natural reward you get that</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.290" end="00:56:38.730" style="s2">first natural feedback mechanism says</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.090" end="00:56:41.730" style="s2">wow thank you here&#39;s millions and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.730" end="00:56:44.370" style="s2">millions of dollars that&#39;s a know that</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.730" end="00:56:46.140" style="s2">you have done something that the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.370" end="00:56:47.790" style="s2">is saying yes the universe is saying yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.140" end="00:56:51.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve done a good job at providing</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.790" end="00:56:52.950" style="s2">something that we want it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.840" end="00:56:55.290" style="s2">for that should not go to your head to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.950" end="00:56:57.810" style="s2">some extent I think right wow what a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.290" end="00:56:59.490" style="s2">great you know provider I am for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.810" end="00:57:03.030" style="s2">world especially the masculine part of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.490" end="00:57:05.100" style="s2">us so what happens next is the question</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.030" end="00:57:07.800" style="s2">this is where I think like having one</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.100" end="00:57:09.540" style="s2">one cycle of that is generally healthy</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.800" end="00:57:12.690" style="s2">I&#39;ll always I think it&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.540" end="00:57:14.280" style="s2">next when but even know even that cycle</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.690" end="00:57:16.440" style="s2">because in game B I&#39;m not talking what</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.280" end="00:57:18.120" style="s2">transition a game B but in game B I come</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.440" end="00:57:20.070" style="s2">up with a new app that like helps</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.120" end="00:57:21.750" style="s2">everybody eat well okay first of all</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.070" end="00:57:23.490" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just me it was me and a group of</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.750" end="00:57:25.170" style="s2">people and so now we&#39;ve created that app</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.490" end="00:57:28.080" style="s2">if we own it and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.170" end="00:57:29.610" style="s2">competitor then that&#39;s rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.080" end="00:57:31.079" style="s2">behavior as soon as you have a large</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.610" end="00:57:32.759" style="s2">payout its rival risky</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.079" end="00:57:34.680" style="s2">because it&#39;s like wait well do I own it</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.759" end="00:57:37.410" style="s2">for all of time if somebody improves it</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.910" end="00:57:51.569" style="s2">very little risk I think in game be</p>

<p begin="00:57:56.039" end="00:57:59.279" style="s2">know if the reward should be there like</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.660" end="00:58:01.769" style="s2">why should anyone have millions of</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.279" end="00:58:04.739" style="s2">dollars to me and this is just my bias</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.769" end="00:58:06.779" style="s2">baby the reward is that you&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.219" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">are you saying yes you do you want them</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.469" end="00:58:26.759" style="s2">to have some to feel a sense of reward</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.930" style="s2">you just don&#39;t know they want me to feel</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.940" end="00:58:34.349" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna skew the right so again</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:35.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the symmetric so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.349" end="00:58:37.829" style="s2">like all we&#39;re doing is if we have</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.940" end="00:58:39.329" style="s2">metrics you know when you started your</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.829" end="00:58:41.309" style="s2">collective you identified your mission</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.329" end="00:58:42.959" style="s2">metrics currencies your mission is good</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.309" end="00:58:44.819" style="s2">for the world right move those</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.959" end="00:58:46.199" style="s2">assumptions in place now when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.819" end="00:58:47.479" style="s2">good at what you do the mission metrics</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.199" end="00:58:49.680" style="s2">currencies are taken as massive</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.479" end="00:58:52.709" style="s2">skyrocket like millions and millions of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.680" end="00:58:54.509" style="s2">units of the that metric moved through</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.709" end="00:58:56.549" style="s2">the system and have accumulated in your</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.509" end="00:58:57.209" style="s2">wallet right for like terms that make</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.549" end="00:58:59.190" style="s2">sense now</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.209" end="00:59:03.449" style="s2">i we can have all new terms for all</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.190" end="00:59:07.259" style="s2">these things later but so that touch</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.449" end="00:59:09.089" style="s2">yeah that doesn&#39;t that like the the fine</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.259" end="00:59:11.309" style="s2">line is are you going to do more good</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.089" end="00:59:14.309" style="s2">stuff now with the greater capacity you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.309" end="00:59:16.849" style="s2">have to be creative right like the in</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.309" end="00:59:18.930" style="s2">theory met those metrics ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.849" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">something that it that gives you even</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.930" end="00:59:26.940" style="s2">more capability to be powerful in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:28.650" style="s2">way you could offer something now yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.940" end="00:59:32.099" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot of other things</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.650" end="00:59:33.869" style="s2">beside in game B besides you get million</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.099" end="00:59:35.579" style="s2">millions of dollars or currency whatever</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.869" end="00:59:37.349" style="s2">lately you have millions of times more</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.579" end="00:59:39.239" style="s2">money than another human being it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.349" end="00:59:40.380" style="s2">you&#39;re not a million times more worthy</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.239" end="00:59:41.619" style="s2">we don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re free our</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.380" end="00:59:44.440" style="s2">distribution is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.619" end="00:59:46.480" style="s2">yeah friends you&#39;re healthy I think the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.440" end="00:59:48.339" style="s2">healthy thing here is that so yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.480" end="00:59:50.859" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an opportunity now where you</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.339" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">have earned greater trust to take it</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.859" end="00:59:54.970" style="s2">even longer loop cycle if you want</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.930" end="00:59:57.369" style="s2">before we get a feedback mechanism but</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.970" end="00:59:59.769" style="s2">essentially having lots of capital or</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.369" end="01:00:02.950" style="s2">having access to capital is lengthens</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.769" end="01:00:05.980" style="s2">the ability you have to do an intense</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.950" end="01:00:09.309" style="s2">in-depth offering that has a longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.980" end="01:00:10.990" style="s2">cycle before you have a feedback until</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.309" end="01:00:13.210" style="s2">you&#39;ve earned now greater trust so</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.990" end="01:00:15.599" style="s2">that&#39;s the healthy web part right you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.210" end="01:00:17.579" style="s2">done it you&#39;ve done one cycle the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.599" end="01:00:20.019" style="s2">rewards you once what you&#39;re offering</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.579" end="01:00:21.730" style="s2">here&#39;s even more so now you can have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.019" end="01:00:23.230" style="s2">longer cycle and get even deeper in your</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.730" end="01:00:25.089" style="s2">thought and really offer something even</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.230" end="01:00:27.910" style="s2">more complex perhaps I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.089" end="01:00:30.940" style="s2">that&#39;s great but yeah but but to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.910" end="01:00:32.289" style="s2">extent that now you&#39;re done forever you</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.940" end="01:00:36.160" style="s2">don&#39;t actually have to offer anything</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.289" end="01:00:38.319" style="s2">you can now it&#39;s about buying houses and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.160" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">yachts and so you have ten empty houses</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.319" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">and a yacht that holds a thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:45.279" style="s2">that you that you have a hundred on from</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:46.779" style="s2">time to time and it just import the rest</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.279" end="01:00:50.410" style="s2">of the time like these these are clearly</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.779" end="01:00:52.630" style="s2">waste of resources right it&#39;s there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.410" end="01:00:55.690" style="s2">reason to have empty houses and a yacht</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.630" end="01:00:57.099" style="s2">that barely gets used so so you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.690" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">this is where we talked about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.099" end="01:01:01.630" style="s2">journey of you know in all this about</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:05.349" style="s2">from individual ownership to collective</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.630" end="01:01:08.170" style="s2">stewardship is really the key so making</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.349" end="01:01:10.269" style="s2">it just more far more the norm in common</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.170" end="01:01:12.130" style="s2">that there&#39;s a yacht that you are a part</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.269" end="01:01:14.109" style="s2">owner of along with a thousand other</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.130" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">people that need to use the thing wants</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.109" end="01:01:20.079" style="s2">to eat here and yeah it still might be</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:21.519" style="s2">only that of those that have proven one</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.079" end="01:01:23.529" style="s2">or more cycles of very successful</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.519" end="01:01:27.489" style="s2">feedback mechanism that haven&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.529" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">the state yacht easily you know or more</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.489" end="01:01:32.529" style="s2">more you know but everybody is there you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:37.210" style="s2">have access to the yacht to in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.529" end="01:01:44.619" style="s2">perfect world of game be and yeah I did</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.210" end="01:01:46.210" style="s2">I answer the question yeah so just a lot</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.619" end="01:01:47.559" style="s2">of the same questions I struggle with</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.210" end="01:01:50.380" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.559" end="01:01:52.569" style="s2">world-changing ideas that I love just</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.380" end="01:01:53.619" style="s2">because I&#39;m somewhat critical of pieces</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.569" end="01:01:55.030" style="s2">of them doesn&#39;t mean I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.619" end="01:01:56.950" style="s2">absolutely 100</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.030" end="01:01:59.560" style="s2">we&#39;ll heartedly choose that over gaming</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.950" end="01:02:02.320" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s like you don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.560" end="01:02:04.450" style="s2">perfect to be game B but like my mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.320" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">wants to like wait what about this what</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.450" end="01:02:10.210" style="s2">about this and why not is yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">these discussions is this is like</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.210" end="01:02:14.140" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with competition</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:16.150" style="s2">in my version of game B competition is</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.140" end="01:02:17.950" style="s2">great you&#39;re competing to make the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.150" end="01:02:21.070" style="s2">as good as you can for as money as many</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.950" end="01:02:23.650" style="s2">beings and all life on it compete away</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.070" end="01:02:25.480" style="s2">by all means um it&#39;s the survival risk</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.650" end="01:02:29.050" style="s2">behavior within the competition that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.480" end="01:02:30.670" style="s2">makes it a problem yeah and that it</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.050" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">hurts all of us that we can see that</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.670" end="01:02:36.700" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s game dynamics game theory and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:39.550" style="s2">how it plays out so my question is so</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.700" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">like game a somewhat makes sense to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.550" end="01:02:43.060" style="s2">understand the economics I understand</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:45.610" style="s2">the finances and I understand Gabey I</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.060" end="01:02:49.080" style="s2">understand somewhat of the a my version</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.610" end="01:02:49.080" style="s2">rate of what it what it could look like</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.110" end="01:02:55.780" style="s2">Oh so under together attack it&#39;s mainly</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.860" end="01:02:58.660" style="s2">a drill Bentley and I Bentley and Adriel</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.780" end="01:03:01.300" style="s2">both have competing projects aid riyals</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.660" end="01:03:03.760" style="s2">is wiki election Bentley is this reason</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.300" end="01:03:06.610" style="s2">score they&#39;re not actually really</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.760" end="01:03:09.190" style="s2">competitive but like they&#39;re so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.610" end="01:03:12.220" style="s2">say one of them is a huge success right</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.190" end="01:03:13.990" style="s2">one of them he takes off let&#39;s say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.220" end="01:03:15.970" style="s2">it&#39;s Bentley so I won&#39;t pick my brother</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.990" end="01:03:17.980" style="s2">to say it&#39;s Bentley his recent score</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.970" end="01:03:20.410" style="s2">takes off but part of the reason reason</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.980" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">score takes off is because Adriel was</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.410" end="01:03:24.220" style="s2">sitting at that table giving him</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:25.720" style="s2">feedback from wiki lecture wiki election</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.220" end="01:03:27.910" style="s2">goes into bankruptcy it&#39;s never a thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.720" end="01:03:30.070" style="s2">but recent scores there and it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.910" end="01:03:32.050" style="s2">10 million Bentley being Bentley might</p>

<p begin="01:04:55.640" end="01:05:01.699" style="s2">happiness yep um so in your speaking to</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.959" end="01:05:05.089" style="s2">what protocols out love defines its</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.699" end="01:05:07.910" style="s2">equity currency equity currency to boil</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.089" end="01:05:10.219" style="s2">it down to I think it&#39;s relevant to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.910" end="01:05:12.109" style="s2">term we use in game a but in game via</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.219" end="01:05:13.459" style="s2">has a very clear meaning and released in</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.109" end="01:05:15.349" style="s2">the protocol that love ontology has a</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.459" end="01:05:18.319" style="s2">very clear meaning which is contra is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.349" end="01:05:20.929" style="s2">recognition of contribution so equity</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.319" end="01:05:22.939" style="s2">currencies are metrics for recognition</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.929" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">of contribution so the answer seems</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.939" end="01:05:26.719" style="s2">simple right</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:27.949" style="s2">if project a is successful then all</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.719" end="01:05:29.630" style="s2">those who contributed towards the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.949" end="01:05:31.729" style="s2">success of project they ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.630" end="01:05:34.279" style="s2">rewarded and if you contributed more you</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.729" end="01:05:36.199" style="s2">should be rewarded more enough right</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.279" end="01:05:39.319" style="s2">there&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.199" end="01:05:40.999" style="s2">like if aid if Bentley hired Adriel to</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.319" end="01:05:42.920" style="s2">be part of reason score there&#39;s a clear</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.999" end="01:05:44.509" style="s2">he put in X amount of hours but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.920" end="01:05:47.449" style="s2">just no we&#39;re sitting at a table</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.509" end="01:05:49.429" style="s2">brainstorming solutions to recent score</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.449" end="01:05:51.170" style="s2">and Wikipedia and it&#39;s clearly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.429" end="01:05:53.569" style="s2">gonna benefit for my you&#39;re both sitting</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.170" end="01:05:55.309" style="s2">there in a ways you can&#39;t quite put</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.569" end="01:05:56.900" style="s2">metrics on right that are like well how</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.309" end="01:05:58.880" style="s2">much did a drill contribute who knows</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.900" end="01:06:00.829" style="s2">but something something was I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.880" end="01:06:02.299" style="s2">think my theories it&#39;s not hard to put</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.829" end="01:06:03.799" style="s2">metrics on those things we just have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.299" end="01:06:05.390" style="s2">be in the habit of doing it it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.799" end="01:06:06.499" style="s2">vulnerable transparency to be clear</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.390" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">about these things and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.499" end="01:06:11.900" style="s2">really a critical piece of what what</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:13.099" style="s2">what I preach when I&#39;m teaching protocol</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.900" end="01:06:15.289" style="s2">that love this is super critical</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.099" end="01:06:17.269" style="s2">important when there&#39;s contribution have</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.289" end="01:06:18.650" style="s2">a metric to identify it and in if</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.269" end="01:06:20.599" style="s2">there&#39;s not there&#39;s a new type of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.650" end="01:06:21.890" style="s2">contribution as and create the canoe</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.599" end="01:06:24.440" style="s2">currency and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.890" end="01:06:25.490" style="s2">see how easy that is so what if I thinks</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.440" end="01:06:26.840" style="s2">I know you have to go pretty soon but</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.490" end="01:06:29.150" style="s2">one of my things about equity</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.840" end="01:06:32.660" style="s2">specifically is that it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.150" end="01:06:34.970" style="s2">for all of us right if I put $1,000 into</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.660" end="01:06:37.250" style="s2">something that is a lot of money for me</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.970" end="01:06:39.230" style="s2">versus Bill Gates who&#39;s like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.250" end="01:06:40.850" style="s2">that&#39;s an African coffee oh here have</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.230" end="01:06:43.550" style="s2">$1,000 right</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.850" end="01:06:45.820" style="s2">it is contribution of all types and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.550" end="01:06:47.870" style="s2">game the transition territory phase</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.820" end="01:06:49.940" style="s2">contributing Federal Reserve notes or</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.870" end="01:06:52.070" style="s2">government funny money we&#39;re recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.940" end="01:06:55.130" style="s2">is a huge contribution like that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.070" end="01:06:56.510" style="s2">be someday because yeah we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.130" end="01:06:58.670" style="s2">capital out of thin air that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.510" end="01:07:00.740" style="s2">happening anyway we&#39;re just creating a</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.670" end="01:07:02.210" style="s2">capital out of thin air like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.740" end="01:07:03.830" style="s2">under game a in the beginning to</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.210" end="01:07:05.540" style="s2">transition mine and Bill Gates a</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.830" end="01:07:09.170" style="s2">thousand is worth the same because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.540" end="01:07:11.300" style="s2">a thousand dollars and it&#39;s or it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.170" end="01:07:14.210" style="s2">risk to me right it&#39;s not a risk to him</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.300" end="01:07:15.500" style="s2">at all and so he&#39;s just like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.210" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">rich and you&#39;re throwing money out to</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.500" end="01:07:18.020" style="s2">see what sticks and whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:19.130" style="s2">getting an investment you&#39;re okay but</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.020" end="01:07:21.260" style="s2">there&#39;s not an investment it&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.130" end="01:07:23.090" style="s2">percentage I&#39;m putting all my eggs in</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.260" end="01:07:24.590" style="s2">one basket right bit like there isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.090" end="01:07:28.340" style="s2">option to spread out a thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.590" end="01:07:29.930" style="s2">this is a risk I&#39;m not a me is not doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.340" end="01:07:32.900" style="s2">that in order to get a financial reward</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.930" end="01:07:34.580" style="s2">someone the Bill Gates is and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.900" end="01:07:35.450" style="s2">there to take you donate like I want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.580" end="01:07:37.790" style="s2">put thousand dollars I want this thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.450" end="01:07:41.560" style="s2">to succeed it&#39;s less likely to succeed</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.790" end="01:07:41.560" style="s2">with me as the investor honestly the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:52.610" style="s2">yeah okay well yeah so bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.970" end="01:07:54.770" style="s2">there for sure yeah yeah really need to</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.610" end="01:07:57.260" style="s2">get when we win game B starts kicking</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.770" end="01:08:00.250" style="s2">and there&#39;s that the the disparity</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.260" end="01:08:02.510" style="s2">between access to resources is lowered</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.250" end="01:08:05.690" style="s2">as well right in the transition area</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.510" end="01:08:07.310" style="s2">phase and absolutely it&#39;s like one of</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.690" end="01:08:09.290" style="s2">the critical things that protocol that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.310" end="01:08:11.030" style="s2">love also proposes a very clear</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.290" end="01:08:15.880" style="s2">separation between equity and influence</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.030" end="01:08:19.340" style="s2">remember equity is contribution and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.880" end="01:08:21.020" style="s2">like the biggest contributor of</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.340" end="01:08:22.790" style="s2">resources is not necessarily the one</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.020" end="01:08:24.980" style="s2">that ought to have the biggest influence</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.790" end="01:08:26.870" style="s2">is over how assets are steward in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.980" end="01:08:29.360" style="s2">collective but that does not need to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.870" end="01:08:31.400" style="s2">an inherent given is like it generally</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.360" end="01:08:32.690" style="s2">were named a and it isn&#39;t always in-game</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.400" end="01:08:34.130" style="s2">a we have the Meccan</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.690" end="01:08:36.500" style="s2">you can start a corporation and create</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.130" end="01:08:38.779" style="s2">multiple classes of stock and get voting</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.500" end="01:08:40.699" style="s2">stock or here and equity stock over here</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.779" end="01:08:43.219" style="s2">that&#39;s totally a thing but it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.699" end="01:08:44.989" style="s2">common practice right it really isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.219" end="01:08:46.759" style="s2">especially not at the startup phase of</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.989" end="01:08:48.949" style="s2">the company equity and influence are</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.759" end="01:08:50.779" style="s2">always inherently intertwined so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.949" end="01:08:54.670" style="s2">therefore the person with the most money</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.779" end="01:08:59.900" style="s2">at the table has the most influence that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.670" end="01:09:01.940" style="s2">based on your history what you&#39;ve put in</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.900" end="01:09:03.380" style="s2">and how it shows your your how good you</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.940" end="01:09:05.179" style="s2">are at knowing finance how good you are</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.380" end="01:09:08.989" style="s2">at knowing the scientific implication or</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.179" end="01:09:11.870" style="s2">how much is it based on I tell you like</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.989" end="01:09:15.710" style="s2">or other people think I&#39;m ignoring that</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.870" end="01:09:17.449" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s again blurring that</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.710" end="01:09:19.429" style="s2">line between the tellers and the Telly&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.449" end="01:09:21.799" style="s2">we&#39;re all telling each other with</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.429" end="01:09:24.440" style="s2">feedback mechanisms internally how much</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.799" end="01:09:26.330" style="s2">we want influence the we want the others</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.440" end="01:09:28.429" style="s2">to have that&#39;s a healthy system so and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.330" end="01:09:30.710" style="s2">your passion and expertise ought to</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.429" end="01:09:32.359" style="s2">people have people saying yes we want</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.710" end="01:09:36.109" style="s2">you to have more influence we want you</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.359" end="01:09:38.120" style="s2">have more influence so you so I you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.109" end="01:09:41.449" style="s2">there is no again there&#39;s no mandated</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.120" end="01:09:43.580" style="s2">way to do this but it&#39;s a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.449" end="01:09:45.319" style="s2">we encourage that the protocol that love</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.580" end="01:09:46.670" style="s2">and the process is attached to it</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.319" end="01:09:49.069" style="s2">encourage people to be in these</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.670" end="01:09:52.040" style="s2">conversations so what is formula for</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.069" end="01:09:53.359" style="s2">contribution to the website like most</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.040" end="01:09:55.250" style="s2">companies need a website so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.359" end="01:09:59.420" style="s2">good one right what is so we can have a</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.250" end="01:10:05.510" style="s2">website development equity currency give</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.420" end="01:10:07.400" style="s2">it a w Dec so you have an intro currency</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.510" end="01:10:08.570" style="s2">that you can just start to it&#39;s a meme</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.400" end="01:10:10.640" style="s2">that you can use within your</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.570" end="01:10:11.989" style="s2">organization and identify hey you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.640" end="01:10:13.370" style="s2">trim through the website let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.989" end="01:10:14.780" style="s2">assign you some equity currency come up</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.370" end="01:10:16.550" style="s2">with formulas and standards for how to</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.780" end="01:10:19.100" style="s2">assign that equity currency and in</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.550" end="01:10:21.410" style="s2">theory the beauty of all this especially</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.100" end="01:10:22.760" style="s2">in the beauty of having just one equity</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.410" end="01:10:24.620" style="s2">currency that represents all of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.760" end="01:10:27.800" style="s2">holdings of a collective like it</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.620" end="01:10:29.260" style="s2">generally does in-game a corporation you</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.800" end="01:10:31.550" style="s2">have many equity currencies that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.260" end="01:10:33.739" style="s2">recognize all the different varying</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.550" end="01:10:35.810" style="s2">contributions in their own separate</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.739" end="01:10:38.120" style="s2">buckets the separate buckets of value</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.810" end="01:10:42.050" style="s2">and currency seeing the current of value</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.120" end="01:10:44.660" style="s2">flow within the system so the beauty of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.050" end="01:10:46.250" style="s2">this is that if there is a fork someday</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.660" end="01:10:49.670" style="s2">Forks like</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.250" end="01:10:51.950" style="s2">so in other words a split a a the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.670" end="01:10:53.390" style="s2">these things show up is you&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.950" end="01:10:55.610" style="s2">getting whatever your decision-making</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.390" end="01:10:58.270" style="s2">methodology is the start feeling tension</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.610" end="01:11:01.490" style="s2">around decisions you start noticing oh</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.270" end="01:11:02.690" style="s2">there&#39;s we&#39;re close here like this is we</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.490" end="01:11:04.610" style="s2">could go two different directions and</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.690" end="01:11:07.400" style="s2">there&#39;s almost a split and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.610" end="01:11:09.050" style="s2">getting solid consensus anymore and if</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.400" end="01:11:10.970" style="s2">you see that consistently happening you</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.050" end="01:11:13.400" style="s2">can guarantee if Forks coming this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.970" end="01:11:14.750" style="s2">a bad thing right this should mean in</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.400" end="01:11:16.820" style="s2">theory if you look at your mission as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.750" end="01:11:19.220" style="s2">group that there&#39;s actually a slightly</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.820" end="01:11:22.100" style="s2">different submission that is it that</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.220" end="01:11:23.330" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to appear just take that</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.100" end="01:11:24.200" style="s2">and create a new collective with that</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.330" end="01:11:26.270" style="s2">mission and create a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.200" end="01:11:29.290" style="s2">between the two collectives to make that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.270" end="01:11:32.090" style="s2">easy the equity currency contributions</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.290" end="01:11:34.220" style="s2">it&#39;s good say okay well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.090" end="01:11:35.660" style="s2">contributed these things so why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.220" end="01:11:37.190" style="s2">you guys take the website to the new</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.660" end="01:11:38.300" style="s2">because most of the people who want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.190" end="01:11:40.190" style="s2">go to the new collective with the new</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.300" end="01:11:42.350" style="s2">mission worked a website contributor so</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.190" end="01:11:43.580" style="s2">you take the website and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.350" end="01:11:44.720" style="s2">give you what little equity currency we</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.580" end="01:11:46.100" style="s2">have there so we&#39;ll give you that extra</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.720" end="01:11:48.080" style="s2">currency in exchange you give us the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.100" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">equity currency that you have on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.080" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">intellectual property for this process</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:53.660" style="s2">we created or whatever it might be or</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:55.340" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the well we&#39;ll keep the</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.660" end="01:11:57.170" style="s2">office the real estate we invested in</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.340" end="01:11:58.790" style="s2">for our home office we&#39;ll take that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.170" end="01:12:00.620" style="s2">take the website and all you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.790" end="01:12:02.090" style="s2">exchanging equity currencies literally</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.620" end="01:12:03.800" style="s2">you&#39;re in a market exchange of it the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.090" end="01:12:06.440" style="s2">equity currencies to have a nice clean</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.800" end="01:12:08.270" style="s2">fork with two separate missions now and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.440" end="01:12:10.430" style="s2">nobody has to know nobody there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.270" end="01:12:12.410" style="s2">have to be any winners or losers a fork</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.430" end="01:12:15.530" style="s2">is just the most natural phenomenon and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.410" end="01:12:17.510" style="s2">creating the most effective you know an</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.530" end="01:12:20.480" style="s2">efficient way for things to frack lies</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.510" end="01:12:22.520" style="s2">in the ecosystem yeah no I like that I</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.480" end="01:12:23.930" style="s2">was laughing because it&#39;s I think we</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.520" end="01:12:25.670" style="s2">have different ideas on how to get to</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.930" end="01:12:28.700" style="s2">gain be similar in tianhao day and like</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.670" end="01:12:30.470" style="s2">I think we both are I&#39;m like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.700" end="01:12:32.630" style="s2">okay if I disagree because it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.470" end="01:12:34.790" style="s2">my way anyway like not not in a because</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.630" end="01:12:37.010" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna like overpower it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.790" end="01:12:41.120" style="s2">oh collectively humans do this and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.010" end="01:12:43.280" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true if but like that</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.120" end="01:12:44.930" style="s2">in game B I don&#39;t think we have those</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.280" end="01:12:46.310" style="s2">competing entities and you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.930" end="01:12:47.810" style="s2">figure that out so I think that like</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.310" end="01:12:49.880" style="s2">there is a pool that we all just own</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.810" end="01:12:52.130" style="s2">together because it&#39;s more efficient and</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.880" end="01:12:53.720" style="s2">it&#39;s more but in order to ever get there</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.130" end="01:12:54.950" style="s2">we have to go through a transition like</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.720" end="01:12:56.930" style="s2">we are with the other tech where people</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.950" end="01:12:57.920" style="s2">feel like they own their project because</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.930" end="01:12:59.090" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to put your time and</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.920" end="01:12:59.690" style="s2">energy into something if you feel like</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.090" end="01:13:01.219" style="s2">you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.690" end="01:13:02.690" style="s2">there comes a point where you feel safe</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.219" end="01:13:04.699" style="s2">enough in the world feel safe enough</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.690" end="01:13:06.980" style="s2">that you&#39;re like oh I don&#39;t I love the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.699" end="01:13:08.480" style="s2">idea of the 14 mission because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.980" end="01:13:10.760" style="s2">necessarily like you&#39;re thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.480" end="01:13:12.260" style="s2">it in-game a very understandable terms</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.760" end="01:13:14.989" style="s2">of like right we need to legally own</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.260" end="01:13:17.030" style="s2">this that needs to be like what works in</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.989" end="01:13:19.100" style="s2">the world right now and so it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.030" end="01:13:20.270" style="s2">have that it absolutely need but I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.100" end="01:13:23.030" style="s2">eventually get to a point where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.270" end="01:13:25.790" style="s2">have that yeah well we have the tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.030" end="01:13:27.320" style="s2">of the commons issue to address right so</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.790" end="01:13:29.180" style="s2">the more things we put into the Commons</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.320" end="01:13:30.760" style="s2">like the tragedy is there&#39;s nobody</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.180" end="01:13:35.210" style="s2">properly stewarding it anymore</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.760" end="01:13:36.980" style="s2">the problem is also solves all the only</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.210" end="01:13:39.020" style="s2">relevance to any of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.980" end="01:13:41.540" style="s2">protocol that love proposes around the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.020" end="01:13:43.370" style="s2">stewardship of assets like if you need a</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.540" end="01:13:44.870" style="s2">decision-making process to go you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.370" end="01:13:47.480" style="s2">what movie you&#39;re gonna go see with your</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.870" end="01:13:48.949" style="s2">friends I mean like you don&#39;t like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.480" end="01:13:50.449" style="s2">very informal like that can roll like</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.949" end="01:13:52.250" style="s2">nobody&#39;s gonna be that upset if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.449" end="01:13:53.570" style="s2">choose if they that&#39;s not really the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.250" end="01:13:56.060" style="s2">movie I wanted to see but okay I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.570" end="01:13:59.210" style="s2">with you guys you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.060" end="01:14:01.489" style="s2">not but when you&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.210" end="01:14:03.290" style="s2">know a decision that&#39;s gonna affect like</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.489" end="01:14:05.570" style="s2">the fruit production of the entire plant</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.290" end="01:14:08.590" style="s2">it like there&#39;s a different thing so</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.570" end="01:14:10.790" style="s2">it&#39;s this is all the all of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.590" end="01:14:12.860" style="s2">processes are in place here in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.790" end="01:14:15.560" style="s2">transparency is around the stewardship</p>

<p begin="01:14:33.530" end="01:14:39.110" style="s2">stewardship is actually the I think the</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.280" end="01:14:42.050" style="s2">only metric I&#39;m okay equally an</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.110" end="01:14:44.300" style="s2">ownership that like if you&#39;re stewarding</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.050" end="01:14:46.310" style="s2">this stream if you&#39;re Stewart II miss</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.300" end="01:14:47.810" style="s2">campground then yeah you effectively own</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.310" end="01:14:49.580" style="s2">it and make decisions in a way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.810" end="01:14:51.530" style="s2">not going to just being a one-off person</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.580" end="01:14:53.540" style="s2">going there go but there&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.530" end="01:14:55.250" style="s2">difference between I put equity in in</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.540" end="01:14:56.320" style="s2">game a world I put in a million dollars</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.250" end="01:14:59.150" style="s2">and that was nothing to me</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.320" end="01:15:01.219" style="s2">you know like versus that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.150" end="01:15:03.410" style="s2">stewardship that&#39;s not okay I care about</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.219" end="01:15:05.150" style="s2">the purpose I care about the mission of</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.410" end="01:15:06.920" style="s2">this because then you are gonna come up</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.150" end="01:15:08.989" style="s2">to against headway of like we have a</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.920" end="01:15:09.830" style="s2">different mission my you know I want to</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.989" end="01:15:12.080" style="s2">feed the world</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.830" end="01:15:13.280" style="s2">first chiefly as possible and you want</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.080" end="01:15:13.640" style="s2">to feed the world that&#39;s nutritious as</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.280" end="01:15:16.460" style="s2">pasta</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.640" end="01:15:18.920" style="s2">those are two both important and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.460" end="01:15:20.660" style="s2">know for key and realizing how can we</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.920" end="01:15:23.060" style="s2">support each other&#39;s missions is I love</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.660" end="01:15:24.470" style="s2">that idea and I just my issue is just</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.060" end="01:15:25.760" style="s2">like once we get to a certain party game</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.470" end="01:15:27.860" style="s2">B we don&#39;t need the patents and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.760" end="01:15:30.470" style="s2">intellectual property and the contracts</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.860" end="01:15:32.030" style="s2">as much as we do now right now we</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.470" end="01:15:33.410" style="s2">absolutely need those things to get</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.030" end="01:15:35.240" style="s2">there and then I think the humanity</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.410" end="01:15:37.850" style="s2">based on the fact we do have this</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.240" end="01:15:39.830" style="s2">cooperation in us and we like efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.850" end="01:15:42.350" style="s2">eventually we get to a point where we</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.830" end="01:15:44.870" style="s2">don&#39;t need that because it does cost us</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.350" end="01:15:47.270" style="s2">resources to have that right so</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.870" end="01:15:48.890" style="s2">ownership in protocol that love is some</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.270" end="01:15:50.780" style="s2">combination of influence and equity</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.890" end="01:15:51.350" style="s2">which can be represented with metrics in</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.780" end="01:15:54.430" style="s2">both cases</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.350" end="01:15:57.170" style="s2">so remember equity is not is</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.430" end="01:15:59.360" style="s2">contribution one way to get equity is</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.170" end="01:16:01.730" style="s2">money always like in the transition or</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.360" end="01:16:04.640" style="s2">in the transitionary phase one way to</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.730" end="01:16:07.730" style="s2">have equity is money by giving what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.640" end="01:16:09.710" style="s2">can you know monetary types well but it</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.730" end="01:16:11.390" style="s2">is supposed to recognize contribution so</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.710" end="01:16:13.910" style="s2">some form of the fact that you actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.390" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">contributed and the fact that you or the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.910" end="01:16:20.900" style="s2">fact that you just have good ideas which</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.580" style="s2">we want you to have influence when you</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.900" end="01:16:24.860" style="s2">have good ideas and they want you do</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.580" end="01:16:26.060" style="s2">contribute certainly on what you have</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.860" end="01:16:27.800" style="s2">that can be recognized as equity</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.060" end="01:16:31.460" style="s2">currency so ownership becomes just some</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.800" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">form of equity or or influence currency</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.460" end="01:16:34.760" style="s2">over a particular set of assets that</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.170" end="01:16:36.590" style="s2">makes you an owner and anybody can</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.760" end="01:16:40.310" style="s2">become an owner in any asset that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.590" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2">object right and with that yeah I didn&#39;t</p>
