<p begin="00:00:52.710" end="00:00:59.190" style="s2">actually learned more I think watching</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">it a second time than being there in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:03.199" style="s2">first time yeah it was really neat and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.350" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">by chance we did talk a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">religion stuff in the first chat so</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">hopefully we can get a really mmm I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">guess in more detail this time around</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">sure I also just want to kind of affirm</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.220" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">I guess my value proposition of what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:34.040" style="s2">trying to offer here I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">Engineers I don&#39;t know what kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.040" end="00:01:37.860" style="s2">cognition engineers I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:41.509" style="s2">that&#39;s a word that makes sense for you</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.860" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">but what I&#39;m trying to do is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.509" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">like expose not exposed but like to show</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:52.649" style="s2">the diagram from within which all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:56.219" style="s2">this like sense making and engineering</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.649" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">stuff is happening so so that&#39;s why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.219" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">asking kind of like simple questions to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:04.250" style="s2">try to get simple I&#39;m trying to make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">nice diagram of what&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.250" end="00:02:11.650" style="s2">I&#39;ve also prepared something which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:16.840" style="s2">calling a Socratic prayer</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.650" end="00:02:19.540" style="s2">okay so yeah I hope you like this so</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.840" end="00:02:21.870" style="s2">this is its prayer but it&#39;s it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.540" end="00:02:24.790" style="s2">secular you know this is just something</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.870" end="00:02:27.909" style="s2">it&#39;s an experiment we can do right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.790" end="00:02:32.110" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;ll help diet the dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.909" end="00:02:34.140" style="s2">that&#39;s happening right so I&#39;ll just read</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.110" end="00:02:38.170" style="s2">what I wrote okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.140" end="00:02:41.260" style="s2">in dialectic the conversation sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.170" end="00:02:43.480" style="s2">leads itself we hope that this will</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.260" end="00:02:46.359" style="s2">happen and we can be in a properly</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.480" end="00:02:48.549" style="s2">submissive and receptive mood we</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.359" end="00:02:51.340" style="s2">recognize that what we seek is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.549" end="00:02:54.670" style="s2">directly within our grasp for if it were</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.340" end="00:02:56.769" style="s2">we would already have it by attempting</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.670" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">to grasp it we gain the chance of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.769" end="00:03:02.049" style="s2">receiving it by being sincere and eager</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">and our efforts we will surely succeed</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.049" end="00:03:07.829" style="s2">in time</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:10.269" style="s2">amen amen I like that that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.829" end="00:03:12.250" style="s2">excellent I&#39;m glad you liked it and of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.269" end="00:03:15.400" style="s2">course feel free to use that in any way</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.250" end="00:03:22.299" style="s2">you&#39;d like to in the future okay great</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.400" end="00:03:24.579" style="s2">thank you so where to begin is there</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.299" end="00:03:26.380" style="s2">anything you want to begin with nope</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.579" end="00:03:28.209" style="s2">well I&#39;m open to just you initiating</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:33.579" style="s2">things and asking questions as you see</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.209" end="00:03:40.359" style="s2">fit okay excellent so religion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.579" end="00:03:42.940" style="s2">then the topic of the day last time we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.359" end="00:03:45.790" style="s2">talked about and you mentioned how there</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.940" end="00:03:50.109" style="s2">are three big M&#39;s there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.790" end="00:03:55.629" style="s2">metaphysics the mythos and meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.109" end="00:04:00.549" style="s2">technology right yeah so I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.629" end="00:04:03.579" style="s2">first question is what would how would a</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.549" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">wisdom culture be different from that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.579" end="00:04:08.949" style="s2">it is how would a wisdom culture be</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:14.889" style="s2">different from that a wisdom culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.949" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">would have explicitly developed a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.889" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2">a meta secular technology and a homing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">metaphysics for it and entered into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">significant</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.230" end="00:04:33.640" style="s2">reconstructive but respectful dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.790" end="00:04:36.280" style="s2">with the existing cultural mythos to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.640" end="00:04:39.430" style="s2">and integrate with that mythos machinery</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.280" end="00:04:42.180" style="s2">as much as possible so a you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:45.250" style="s2">classic example of this is neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.180" end="00:04:47.950" style="s2">that really tries to develop the meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.250" end="00:04:49.750" style="s2">second technology of dialectic then</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.950" end="00:04:51.640" style="s2">works out a metaphysics around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.750" end="00:04:56.440" style="s2">central notion of intelligibility as our</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.640" end="00:04:58.750" style="s2">main marker of realness and then that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.440" end="00:05:02.020" style="s2">metaphysics is consciously and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.750" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">deliberately integrated with the mythos</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:09.010" style="s2">of the the of late antiquity pagan</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:10.510" style="s2">mythos and then eventually gets taken up</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.010" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">and it gets integrated with Christian</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.510" end="00:05:15.370" style="s2">mythos so there&#39;s those two strands a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">pagan and a Christian version and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.370" end="00:05:22.060" style="s2">Neoplatonism later gets taken up into</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:24.250" style="s2">Sufism as well through into Islam and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.060" end="00:05:27.790" style="s2">what you see is a reworking of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.250" end="00:05:31.270" style="s2">mythos and a sort of a reverse</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.790" end="00:05:35.190" style="s2">engineering of new practices ritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.270" end="00:05:37.810" style="s2">practices spiritual exercises to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.190" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">enact that integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.810" end="00:05:43.210" style="s2">metaphysics the meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">and the mythos you you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.210" end="00:05:47.380" style="s2">history actually really unfolding and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.060" style="s2">lot of people a lot of distributed</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.380" end="00:05:51.160" style="s2">cognition putting a lot of work into it</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.060" end="00:05:54.100" style="s2">both within individuals who are writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.160" end="00:05:56.860" style="s2">and like these long you know repeated</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.100" end="00:05:59.050" style="s2">treatises and dialogues and write with</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.860" end="00:06:00.370" style="s2">other people and then they&#39;re also in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.050" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">dialog and then there&#39;s a cross</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.370" end="00:06:05.070" style="s2">generation this is a very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">comprehensive land on long term</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.070" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">long-standing project which is I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:13.360" style="s2">why verse Lewis and his work basically</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:15.340" style="s2">said that neoplatonism is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.360" end="00:06:17.940" style="s2">mystical spirituality of the West</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.340" end="00:06:21.040" style="s2">because that all that work was really</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.940" end="00:06:24.370" style="s2">dedicated to weaving those three</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.040" end="00:06:26.590" style="s2">together explicate in it integrating it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.370" end="00:06:30.450" style="s2">with rational practices of overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.590" end="00:06:32.440" style="s2">self-deception and an enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.450" end="00:06:34.210" style="s2">meaningful connectedness enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.440" end="00:06:35.470" style="s2">religio because that&#39;s ultimately I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.210" end="00:06:38.500" style="s2">think what it&#39;s all about overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.470" end="00:06:40.600" style="s2">self-deception and enhancing religio</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.500" end="00:06:45.790" style="s2">and they were wise enough to realize</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.600" end="00:06:50.350" style="s2">that religio is bound up with mythos but</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.790" end="00:06:55.780" style="s2">enacted imaginal pictures and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.350" end="00:06:58.390" style="s2">propositions and practices okay and am i</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.780" end="00:07:01.960" style="s2">right to say religio is connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.390" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">there&#39;s something more than that well I</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.960" end="00:07:06.460" style="s2">mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:09.130" style="s2">just that but it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.460" end="00:07:13.480" style="s2">important I mean religio is what results</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.130" end="00:07:14.919" style="s2">from successful relevance realization /</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.480" end="00:07:19.120" style="s2">meeting through all the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.919" end="00:07:20.830" style="s2">knowing so you get the you zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.120" end="00:07:23.590" style="s2">the most relevant affordances and within</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.830" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">participatory knowing you zero in on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.590" end="00:07:27.700" style="s2">most relevant perspectives within</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:29.560" style="s2">perspective travel knowing and get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.700" end="00:07:31.240" style="s2">right the best situational awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.560" end="00:07:34.030" style="s2">then you zero in on the best set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.240" end="00:07:36.430" style="s2">skills to learn or to apply or to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.030" end="00:07:38.830" style="s2">transfer within procedural knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.430" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">then you zero in on the best set of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.830" end="00:07:45.270" style="s2">inferences to make on the basis of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:49.780" style="s2">propositional knowing and so religio</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.270" end="00:07:53.080" style="s2">does all of that so that you are much</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.780" end="00:07:55.960" style="s2">more optimally gripping of yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.080" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">really well connected to yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.960" end="00:08:00.040" style="s2">other people into the world because</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:02.200" style="s2">though that&#39;s those that sense of</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.200" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">of kinds of knowing is what primarily</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:13.300" style="s2">contributes to people&#39;s sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:15.150" style="s2">in life and also that affords that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.300" end="00:08:18.729" style="s2">connectedness affords them</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.150" end="00:08:20.620" style="s2">well the vertical affords them getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.729" end="00:08:23.620" style="s2">the two things that I think human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.620" end="00:08:25.540" style="s2">most often seek the meta drives that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.620" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">pursued by the meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.540" end="00:08:30.520" style="s2">which is you know an inner optimization</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.469" style="s2">a reduction of inner conflict of self</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.520" end="00:08:35.530" style="s2">deception an optimization of</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.469" end="00:08:37.270" style="s2">functionality and then you know a</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.270" end="00:08:41.050" style="s2">world so you get that reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.610" end="00:08:44.830" style="s2">that&#39;s so important because</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.050" end="00:08:46.690" style="s2">connectedness to what&#39;s real and having</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.830" end="00:08:48.550" style="s2">that connectedness with as much peace of</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:09:03.580" style="s2">that&#39;s why they enjoy the flow state so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.130" end="00:09:08.170" style="s2">much okay would you say that religio is</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.580" end="00:09:09.959" style="s2">the experience of effective meta psycho</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.959" end="00:09:15.339" style="s2">I think I think that&#39;s to put it the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.720" end="00:09:19.420" style="s2">wrong way around I think we have religio</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.339" end="00:09:21.730" style="s2">regard I think religio is indispensable</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.420" end="00:09:23.410" style="s2">unavoidable human beings have to do have</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.730" end="00:09:24.490" style="s2">some degree of religio or that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.410" end="00:09:26.110" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t be doing relevance</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.490" end="00:09:29.890" style="s2">realization and then they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:32.140" style="s2">currently I think what you get when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.890" end="00:09:35.080" style="s2">have a successful meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.140" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">that is activating accessing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.080" end="00:09:39.370" style="s2">accelerating and accentuating your</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:42.040" style="s2">religio that&#39;s when you get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.370" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">sacredness so that&#39;s where that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.040" end="00:09:47.310" style="s2">would say that is a sense of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">hmm</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.310" end="00:09:53.589" style="s2">yes sacredness was a big topic last time</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:59.500" style="s2">for us that I could definitely go more</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.589" end="00:10:01.810" style="s2">into yeah would you say that sacred I</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.500" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">mean it seems sacredness what is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.810" end="00:10:06.580" style="s2">essential aspect of religion would that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:07.870" style="s2">also be true for a wisdom culture I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.580" end="00:10:11.320" style="s2">think so</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.870" end="00:10:16.390" style="s2">I think wisdom cultures insofar as they</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.320" end="00:10:18.730" style="s2">are pursuing that which you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.390" end="00:10:20.440" style="s2">sacredness has a primary function it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.730" end="00:10:22.300" style="s2">sort of the highest level version of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.440" end="00:10:24.100" style="s2">relevance realization we do it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.300" end="00:10:26.350" style="s2">optimizing and playing with it serious</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.100" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">play with it and then so far as</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.350" end="00:10:34.150" style="s2">sacredness gives us that sense of peace</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:37.329" style="s2">that sort of sense of home but also that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.150" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">sense of connecting and opening up to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.329" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">reality beyond our egocentric bias right</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:47.380" style="s2">so it has to be it has to both give us a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:49.029" style="s2">sense of home which is you know the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.380" end="00:10:53.170" style="s2">powerful kind of sort of assimilation</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.029" end="00:10:56.920" style="s2">machinery we need and a sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.170" end="00:10:58.600" style="s2">numinous the sense of going through</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.920" end="00:11:00.610" style="s2">transformation accommodation to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.600" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">reality that is beyond us that puts</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.610" end="00:11:02.930" style="s2">demands on us</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:04.820" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.930" end="00:11:06.440" style="s2">but also affords growth because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.820" end="00:11:09.140" style="s2">just chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.440" end="00:11:11.150" style="s2">I think insofar as the sacredness puts</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.140" end="00:11:12.490" style="s2">us into those situations for its own for</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.150" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">their own sake</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.490" end="00:11:20.870" style="s2">so sacredness is to basically seriously</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:23.330" style="s2">play within the being mode with all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.870" end="00:11:25.930" style="s2">this machinery for a developmental</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.330" end="00:11:27.470" style="s2">purpose you&#39;re not trying to get any</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.930" end="00:11:29.420" style="s2">specific goal</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.470" end="00:11:30.980" style="s2">I mean people also have specific goals</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.420" end="00:11:33.710" style="s2">whether they pray to the gods or things</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.980" end="00:11:35.420" style="s2">like that but what&#39;s across the board is</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.710" end="00:11:37.640" style="s2">what people are doing is very analogous</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.420" end="00:11:40.100" style="s2">to what they&#39;re doing with music they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.640" end="00:11:42.710" style="s2">playing with sound and salience in order</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.100" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">to really improve their sense of religio</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.710" end="00:11:47.270" style="s2">and celebrate it just celebrate it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">because music is participatory is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.270" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">perspectival it&#39;s procedural right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:53.270" style="s2">got all this stuff and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:55.130" style="s2">celebrating it and in right and enjoying</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.270" end="00:11:58.070" style="s2">it what enjoyment doesn&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.130" end="00:12:00.290" style="s2">pleasure it means that sense of being</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.070" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">you know one with yourself and that one</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.290" end="00:12:04.010" style="s2">with the world but not statically but</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.620" style="s2">dynamically that&#39;s why we that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.010" end="00:12:11.450" style="s2">need she said and life without a night</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.620" end="00:12:16.280" style="s2">life without music would be a mistake so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.450" end="00:12:17.870" style="s2">music this is my primary metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.280" end="00:12:20.270" style="s2">sacredness and that&#39;s why music has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.870" end="00:12:21.800" style="s2">so deeply and all the way back to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.270" end="00:12:25.730" style="s2">Upper Paleolithic transition has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.800" end="00:12:31.610" style="s2">associated with sacredness sacred</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.730" end="00:12:35.750" style="s2">ceremony sacred drama sacred ritual it</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.610" end="00:12:38.180" style="s2">seems to me that you know it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.750" end="00:12:40.640" style="s2">using a lot of these terms I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.180" end="00:12:44.410" style="s2">there&#39;s lacking a lot of clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.640" end="00:12:49.540" style="s2">English shelley&#39;s but religion is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.410" end="00:12:54.110" style="s2">it seems to me like religion is the men</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.540" end="00:12:57.250" style="s2">station and it&#39;s like the building that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.110" end="00:13:02.020" style="s2">has been built from the natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.250" end="00:13:04.850" style="s2">evolution of religio like how religio</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.020" end="00:13:08.450" style="s2">happened within individuals and between</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.850" end="00:13:12.050" style="s2">groups eventually it kind of stay</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.450" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">civilized so that word it I come static</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.050" end="00:13:17.130" style="s2">into a religion is that right</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:20.220" style="s2">I think it I mean that&#39;s what many</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.130" end="00:13:23.190" style="s2">people like Winkelman and especially not</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:26.670" style="s2">Rossano and David Lewis Williams which</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.190" end="00:13:27.060" style="s2">say with about shamanism it evolves that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.670" end="00:13:29.880" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.060" end="00:13:33.390" style="s2">I mean religion and this is religion is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.880" end="00:13:37.140" style="s2">bound out and it&#39;s bound up and it binds</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.390" end="00:13:39.540" style="s2">together our biological aspects but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.140" end="00:13:40.920" style="s2">but also our cultural aspects and notice</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.540" end="00:13:44.550" style="s2">the association between these three</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.920" end="00:13:48.420" style="s2">words cult culture and cultivating right</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.550" end="00:13:51.900" style="s2">those are all bound up together and so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.420" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">think when human beings became cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.900" end="00:14:05.610" style="s2">beings and when they had to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">out of their their make sense with their</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.610" end="00:14:14.430" style="s2">capacity for self-awareness and in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:16.410" style="s2">need to justify their behavior to others</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.430" end="00:14:18.420" style="s2">and accept the justification of their</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.410" end="00:14:20.970" style="s2">behaviors from others so when we get</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.420" end="00:14:22.560" style="s2">into meaning and sort of the beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.970" end="00:14:25.080" style="s2">of normativity that&#39;s when you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.560" end="00:14:27.180" style="s2">culture and I think that&#39;s when religio</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.080" end="00:14:30.740" style="s2">moves towards becoming something like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.180" end="00:14:35.190" style="s2">religion we start to create ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.740" end="00:14:38.880" style="s2">trying to afford people being able to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.190" end="00:14:40.860" style="s2">understand and follow the normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.880" end="00:14:43.290" style="s2">the meaning that we&#39;re making and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.860" end="00:14:47.910" style="s2">that we we can have a common ground by</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.290" end="00:14:50.450" style="s2">which we can evaluate and judge and each</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.910" end="00:14:52.860" style="s2">other and reflect on each other behavior</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.450" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">each other&#39;s commitments I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.860" end="00:14:55.740" style="s2">we&#39;re the only animals that have to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:57.630" style="s2">that right now I had a really extra</p>

<p begin="00:15:32.489" end="00:15:36.929" style="s2">about managing all of that machinery so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.949" end="00:15:39.119" style="s2">all of our individual meaning projects</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.929" end="00:15:42.089" style="s2">have a home have a something they sit</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.119" end="00:15:44.670" style="s2">within that nurtures them but also</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.089" end="00:15:45.809" style="s2">pushes them to grow and develop now</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.670" end="00:15:49.259" style="s2">that&#39;s of course we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.809" end="00:15:53.009" style="s2">religion in its ideal case right we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.259" end="00:15:55.019" style="s2">we have to completely acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.009" end="00:15:56.670" style="s2">we have to have a balanced about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.019" end="00:15:58.230" style="s2">right we have to acknowledge all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.670" end="00:15:59.819" style="s2">ways in which religion could go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.230" end="00:16:01.319" style="s2">and has hurt and harmed people</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.819" end="00:16:06.299" style="s2">I&#39;ve been harmed by religion myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.319" end="00:16:09.119" style="s2">personally but we shouldn&#39;t do and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.299" end="00:16:10.829" style="s2">is one of the things I sort of critical</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.119" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">of some of the new atheists about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.829" end="00:16:14.519" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t make this criticism</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:17.480" style="s2">specific to religion all of our</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.519" end="00:16:20.100" style="s2">institutions have been a source of great</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.480" end="00:16:22.199" style="s2">you know terror and trauma the state of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.100" end="00:16:25.589" style="s2">course has been that the market has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.199" end="00:16:29.879" style="s2">that right you know any any of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.589" end="00:16:33.980" style="s2">huge systems by which distributed</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.879" end="00:16:37.230" style="s2">cognition is constituted and regulated</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.980" end="00:16:39.689" style="s2">can is tremendously powerful for</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.230" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">affording people meaning in life and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.689" end="00:16:44.970" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom but also for</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:46.619" style="s2">stupefying them accelerating their</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.970" end="00:16:50.189" style="s2">foolishness and exploiting them therein</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.619" end="00:16:52.829" style="s2">so I&#39;m so when we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.189" end="00:16:54.480" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about you know religion in</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.829" end="00:16:56.249" style="s2">an ideal case like I would be talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.480" end="00:16:58.319" style="s2">about science in an ideal case science</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.249" end="00:16:59.610" style="s2">is also you know science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.319" end="00:17:02.459" style="s2">are bound together and they also have</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.610" end="00:17:06.299" style="s2">done horrific and dangerous things but</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.459" end="00:17:10.230" style="s2">so we have to play fair and honestly</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.299" end="00:17:11.459" style="s2">about this but this phenomena and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.230" end="00:17:15.899" style="s2">argument I do take seriously this</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.459" end="00:17:17.850" style="s2">phenomena of the cultural enhancement of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.899" end="00:17:20.639" style="s2">religio that&#39;s what I think is at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.850" end="00:17:24.299" style="s2">core of religion I think this is in</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.639" end="00:17:26.789" style="s2">endemic and constitutive of our ability</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.299" end="00:17:29.340" style="s2">to become a person that the cultivation</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.789" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">of personhood because a person is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.340" end="00:17:34.860" style="s2">someone who lives within a community of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:37.320" style="s2">distributed cognition shared meaning</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.860" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">making and shared structures of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.320" end="00:17:41.530" style="s2">argumentation and justification I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what a person</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.530" end="00:17:51.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a creature that has moral and</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">epistemic status for us so just before</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.290" end="00:18:01.630" style="s2">the the personhood when my brain is</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:15.500" style="s2">fuzzy trying to catch up religio right</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.630" end="00:18:19.370" style="s2">religion as mmm facilitator or home yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.500" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">facilitator and home and enhancer so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.370" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah so yeah I like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.410" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">facilitator but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.470" end="00:18:31.370" style="s2">what does culture mean we have a shared</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:32.870" style="s2">meaning making system that is not just</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.370" end="00:18:34.910" style="s2">in our head it&#39;s enacted it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.870" end="00:18:36.590" style="s2">four kinds of knowledge that coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.910" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">distributed cognition and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.590" end="00:18:40.700" style="s2">instance of religion it coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:43.490" style="s2">distributed cognition for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.700" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">enhancing all of that meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.490" end="00:18:49.040" style="s2">machinery that is constitutive of making</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:54.500" style="s2">human beings making making human beings</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.040" end="00:18:56.210" style="s2">into persons a person to be a person is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.500" end="00:19:02.510" style="s2">to be somebody who is a meshed in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.210" end="00:19:06.110" style="s2">normative systems okay yeah that makes</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.510" end="00:19:09.320" style="s2">sense I&#39;m getting jumbled in my head</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.110" end="00:19:11.630" style="s2">because to me so I have two different</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.320" end="00:19:15.350" style="s2">lenses here right I have the ethos lens</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.630" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">which Aristotle and it only fits into</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.350" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying of like the raft you</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:24.920" style="s2">know political animal in a city doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.870" style="s2">that&#39;s like a human being classic</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.920" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">Aristotle right but then the other side</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:32.080" style="s2">is an under which is like earth soul and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.170" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">deepest part of what we are it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.990" end="00:19:46.340" style="s2">not actually human you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:49.100" style="s2">pure light and pure love and and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.340" end="00:19:51.860" style="s2">human stuff is like this external air</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.100" end="00:19:53.929" style="s2">that we have respect</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.860" end="00:19:56.840" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s part of our life but</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.929" end="00:20:02.420" style="s2">but it&#39;s really all of life is to kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.840" end="00:20:05.980" style="s2">of unfold that layer and kind of get</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.420" end="00:20:09.140" style="s2">more into unity with the inner stuff</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.980" end="00:20:13.880" style="s2">well but look let&#39;s go over to the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.140" end="00:20:15.590" style="s2">side that the the the ethos side or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.880" end="00:20:17.270" style="s2">ananda sites are the ananda side let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.590" end="00:20:21.080" style="s2">do the ananda side so you&#39;re invoking</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.270" end="00:20:22.850" style="s2">light right and love and the type of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.080" end="00:20:25.040" style="s2">love you&#39;re probably invoking is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.850" end="00:20:28.520" style="s2">ultimately a gothic love which is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.040" end="00:20:30.799" style="s2">love that is it not not the love of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.520" end="00:20:32.929" style="s2">consumption or even cooperation but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.799" end="00:20:35.299" style="s2">love that is creative of personhood</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.929" end="00:20:37.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.299" end="00:20:38.299" style="s2">metaphor your seed even in the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.160" end="00:20:40.280" style="s2">buddha will use the metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.299" end="00:20:43.040" style="s2">mother&#39;s relationship for the child as</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.280" end="00:20:44.419" style="s2">the primary metaphor for Karuna what</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.040" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">does a mother do with the child a mother</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.419" end="00:20:49.160" style="s2">gives the kind of love that turns a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:51.380" style="s2">human being into a person and we find</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.160" end="00:20:53.660" style="s2">persons intrinsically valuable there</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.380" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">that they are the pivot points of all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.660" end="00:20:58.160" style="s2">our of all of our meaning making and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.880" end="00:21:00.290" style="s2">valuation systems and look at the light</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.160" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">well what the light right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.290" end="00:21:03.880" style="s2">physical thing but you don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">physical you mean something like</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.880" end="00:21:08.630" style="s2">intelligibility that which makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.820" style="s2">that&#39;s with light things up and reveals</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.630" end="00:21:12.590" style="s2">their presencing and their being you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.820" end="00:21:15.590" style="s2">talking about a kind of identity with</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.590" end="00:21:17.990" style="s2">that that&#39;s deeper than your own ego and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.590" end="00:21:20.419" style="s2">that&#39;s yeah definitely talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.990" end="00:21:23.240" style="s2">that but notice how that&#39;s also meshed</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.419" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">up with a lot of mythological language</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.240" end="00:21:27.650" style="s2">you find the use of light standing for</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:30.440" style="s2">intelligibility standing for being cross</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">culturally and you find that it&#39;s catchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.440" end="00:21:36.380" style="s2">its mimetic and mimetic for for</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:39.440" style="s2">distributed cognition that&#39;s why you use</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.380" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">light to talk about this inner suchness</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.440" end="00:21:44.120" style="s2">of yourself and it&#39;s connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:49.700" style="s2">mystery of the mourners of the world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.120" end="00:21:53.090" style="s2">you didn&#39;t use a camel or apples or butt</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.700" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">but you might use water yeah why do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.090" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">use water why do you use light why do</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">you perhaps use fire but you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">use a table or you don&#39;t use you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:10.450" style="s2">the car or a rocket ship or even</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:12.700" style="s2">something natural right you don&#39;t use a</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.450" end="00:22:15.609" style="s2">desert typically sometimes people do but</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.700" end="00:22:18.820" style="s2">not very much all right so why what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.609" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">have to answer is why do you use why do</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.820" end="00:22:22.029" style="s2">you pick those those are imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.129" style="s2">they&#39;re not just images in their head</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.029" end="00:22:26.139" style="s2">they they&#39;re images between you and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.129" end="00:22:28.059" style="s2">world and between you and other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.139" end="00:22:30.580" style="s2">you have to ask yourself well why do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.059" end="00:22:33.309" style="s2">pick the ones you pick why do they catch</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.580" end="00:22:35.649" style="s2">why do they resonate for you and what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.309" end="00:22:38.859" style="s2">would say is they they you pick the ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.649" end="00:22:40.869" style="s2">you do because they interface between</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.859" end="00:22:43.389" style="s2">your own individual relevance</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.869" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">realization machinery and the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.389" end="00:22:48.549" style="s2">realization that the community is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:50.049" style="s2">belong to are trying to do that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.549" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">that&#39;s how easy are we in on the ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.049" end="00:23:02.409" style="s2">that really work for us did that help</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:05.139" style="s2">well my personal experience kind of says</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.409" end="00:23:08.049" style="s2">otherwise but they&#39;re basically because</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.139" end="00:23:12.099" style="s2">there&#39;s a for me the bhagavad-gita was a</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.049" end="00:23:13.869" style="s2">truly internal mystical spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.099" end="00:23:15.940" style="s2">experience which had no relation to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.869" end="00:23:20.200" style="s2">anything around me in the world you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:22.479" style="s2">so and and in fact I you know I had to</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.200" end="00:23:26.649" style="s2">move to a totally different continent</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.479" end="00:23:29.379" style="s2">after so so I can see where that does</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.649" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">fit in right it&#39;s like once it clicked</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.379" end="00:23:33.700" style="s2">once it clicked then it&#39;s like okay now</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:34.440" style="s2">I need to go find my people and be with</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.700" end="00:23:38.070" style="s2">my people</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.440" end="00:23:41.109" style="s2">yeah the insight doesn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.070" end="00:23:42.669" style="s2">institutionalized in or internal you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.109" end="00:23:44.529" style="s2">know in the world for you or</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.669" end="00:23:46.359" style="s2">internalized in your psyche until it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.529" end="00:23:48.220" style="s2">resonates in distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.359" end="00:23:51.249" style="s2">please remember what the Bhagavad Gita</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.220" end="00:23:54.609" style="s2">is about it&#39;s about integrating that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.249" end="00:23:58.090" style="s2">vertical mystical you know one minute</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.609" end="00:24:03.429" style="s2">with the divine with one&#39;s duty which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.090" end="00:24:05.349" style="s2">a normative you need to write those two</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.429" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">were Indians are inseparably bound</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.349" end="00:24:09.849" style="s2">together with within the bhagavad-gita</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:11.710" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to identify them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.849" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">trying to say that they&#39;re inseparably</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.710" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">bound together</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.150" end="00:24:23.400" style="s2">yes well that the beauty I think of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:26.430" style="s2">stern wisdom cultures because no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.400" end="00:24:28.440" style="s2">heart even call them a religion if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.430" end="00:24:31.500" style="s2">if you look at it wisdom in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.440" end="00:24:33.900" style="s2">compared to Christianity Islam Judaism I</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.500" end="00:24:36.300" style="s2">don&#39;t even think I would use the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.900" end="00:24:38.940" style="s2">religion to describe Hinduism Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.300" end="00:24:40.980" style="s2">you know well that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.940" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">that I mean that&#39;s part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.980" end="00:24:44.370" style="s2">of the word religion as you said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:47.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s actually a really recent</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.370" end="00:24:49.470" style="s2">word most cultures don&#39;t have a word for</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.370" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">it that is anyway separate from their</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.470" end="00:24:55.050" style="s2">sense of community or culture or you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:56.520" style="s2">know their their person identity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.050" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">a group identity an individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.520" end="00:25:05.960" style="s2">personhood if you take worship to be the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:09.230" style="s2">defining feature of religion yes then</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.960" end="00:25:11.880" style="s2">but the problem with that is that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.230" end="00:25:16.490" style="s2">you know that that sort of limits you to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.880" end="00:25:19.500" style="s2">space and particular compares in time</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.490" end="00:25:23.750" style="s2">because and and then the line between</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.500" end="00:25:26.610" style="s2">worship and celebration and worship and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.750" end="00:25:31.440" style="s2">reverence is really really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.610" end="00:25:33.030" style="s2">maintain so that&#39;s why I think if what</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.440" end="00:25:36.660" style="s2">we mean by worship is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.030" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">prototypical Abrahamic worship then of</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.660" end="00:25:39.480" style="s2">course only the Abraham religions turned</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:41.070" style="s2">out to be a religion that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.480" end="00:25:42.929" style="s2">just because we&#39;re being circular which</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.070" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">we&#39;re saying only the Abrahamic</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.929" end="00:25:47.240" style="s2">religions are religion and because only</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:51.590" style="s2">the Abrahamic religions have the feature</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.240" end="00:25:53.790" style="s2">and that that&#39;s kind of useless so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.590" end="00:25:55.559" style="s2">first engineer it I think what are the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.790" end="00:25:59.070" style="s2">perennial problems that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.559" end="00:26:01.980" style="s2">trying to solve and what sets of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.070" end="00:26:05.309" style="s2">practices Ecology&#39;s and practices do</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.980" end="00:26:07.140" style="s2">they generate for solving and resolving</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.309" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">and ameliorating those perennial</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.140" end="00:26:11.910" style="s2">problems and then what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:15.390" style="s2">like in terms of the three M&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.910" end="00:26:19.650" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that and for me anything</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.390" end="00:26:22.800" style="s2">that is doing that and really reliably</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.650" end="00:26:25.710" style="s2">enhancing religio for people within and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.800" end="00:26:26.760" style="s2">affording the cultivation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.710" end="00:26:27.820" style="s2">because those two are inter penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.760" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">like we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.820" end="00:26:33.550" style="s2">I call that a religion but I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">the religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.550" end="00:26:43.210" style="s2">precisely because I think we need to we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:46.660" style="s2">need to reconstruct re-engineer and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.210" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">reinvent eyo the Latin word inventio</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.660" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">means both to discover and to make so</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:56.110" style="s2">reinvent EO psycho technologies and meta</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:59.220" style="s2">psycho technologies and mythos etc that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.110" end="00:27:02.830" style="s2">is independent from this long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.220" end="00:27:04.290" style="s2">heritage that we that we have from not</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.830" end="00:27:07.570" style="s2">I don&#39;t need independent in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.290" end="00:27:13.410" style="s2">discontinuous but we have to break out</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.570" end="00:27:17.320" style="s2">of the cultural cognitive grammar that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.410" end="00:27:19.510" style="s2">regulates our religious or religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.320" end="00:27:22.110" style="s2">if I can put it that way and even people</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.510" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">who aren&#39;t religious have religiosity</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.110" end="00:27:27.910" style="s2">because it&#39;s bound up with a particular</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">axial age to world metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.910" end="00:27:32.860" style="s2">and a particular history the history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:34.180" style="s2">nihilism is Heidegger would put it that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.860" end="00:27:37.390" style="s2">we have to break free from we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.180" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">break free from that historical momentum</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.390" end="00:27:44.910" style="s2">and we have to break free from its</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:47.530" style="s2">attending a constitutive cultural calmer</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.910" end="00:27:51.040" style="s2">culture cognitive grammar we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.530" end="00:27:55.890" style="s2">new forms by which we conceive of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.040" end="00:27:58.330" style="s2">perceive of and act in enact our</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.890" end="00:28:00.280" style="s2">attempts to enhance religio and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.330" end="00:28:06.520" style="s2">cultivate wisdom we need new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.280" end="00:28:08.710" style="s2">that yes I think it&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.520" end="00:28:12.550" style="s2">the one example that came into my head</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.710" end="00:28:16.840" style="s2">was Tony Robbins and another like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.550" end="00:28:18.340" style="s2">know New Age gurus Deepak Chopra you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.840" end="00:28:22.060" style="s2">know here&#39;s another funny thing with</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.340" end="00:28:25.450" style="s2">with the word game-like guru now all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.060" end="00:28:29.590" style="s2">a sudden there&#39;s marketing gurus ya know</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.450" end="00:28:32.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot interfere yeah so we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.590" end="00:28:34.630" style="s2">this phase we&#39;re like the synthesis is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.020" end="00:28:37.540" style="s2">coming and and that&#39;s why it&#39;s I guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.630" end="00:28:39.610" style="s2">it&#39;s confusing a lot of this stuff we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.540" end="00:28:40.890" style="s2">talking about yeah doing it as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.610" end="00:28:44.140" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.890" end="00:28:46.750" style="s2">yeah I hate people like Tony Robbins and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.140" end="00:28:49.750" style="s2">Deepak Chopra to be symptomatic rather</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.750" end="00:28:52.450" style="s2">than particularly of 40 they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.750" end="00:28:54.400" style="s2">actually I think you&#39;re right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.450" end="00:28:56.710" style="s2">trying to create a more secular version</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.400" end="00:28:58.690" style="s2">of this precisely because they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.710" end="00:29:01.240" style="s2">to escape that history but they actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.690" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">just tend to in many cases repeat they</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.240" end="00:29:07.270" style="s2">just flattened and oversimplify the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.660" style="s2">mythos and the cultural cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.270" end="00:29:12.400" style="s2">grammar rather than the deep thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.660" end="00:29:14.740" style="s2">the deep transformation and the very</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.400" end="00:29:16.450" style="s2">deep practice both individually and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.740" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">collectively that is needed to actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.450" end="00:29:25.480" style="s2">overcome it so yes I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:28.930" style="s2">there yeah yeah yeah so I do see people</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.480" end="00:29:31.890" style="s2">I do but I do also accept your point I</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.930" end="00:29:34.870" style="s2">see lots of people both top-down</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.890" end="00:29:37.290" style="s2">meanings sort of scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.870" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">historically you know public</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.290" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">intellectuals whatever that is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:42.730" style="s2">intellectual deep web you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:46.680" style="s2">communities whether they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.730" end="00:29:49.420" style="s2">recreate and reinvent see oh but I also</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.680" end="00:29:51.250" style="s2">see and I&#39;m involved with lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.420" end="00:29:53.170" style="s2">who are doing the bottom-up stuff people</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.250" end="00:29:56.170" style="s2">building new communities of practices</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.170" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">new communication practices new language</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.170" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">of communication and connection and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:05.160" style="s2">communion and and the DES is springing</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">up all over the place to fill the void</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.160" end="00:30:11.710" style="s2">because many people find the oxalates</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:18.760" style="s2">religions non-viable to fill the void</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.710" end="00:30:22.540" style="s2">and to try and reconstruct a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.760" end="00:30:25.600" style="s2">that is somehow consonant with our</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.540" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">scientific worldview but does something</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.600" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">that our scientific world doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:33.700" style="s2">which is homeless in it and afford us</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.870" style="s2">the aspiration to wisdom and enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.700" end="00:30:38.620" style="s2">meaning life because the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.870" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">worldview while powerful doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.620" end="00:30:43.450" style="s2">those important functions so lots of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:48.520" style="s2">people are trying to figure out right</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.450" end="00:30:51.100" style="s2">what this new what this new mythos for</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.520" end="00:30:53.730" style="s2">religio will be the new meta psycho</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.100" end="00:31:00.610" style="s2">technology right</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.730" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">the new meaning it&#39;s got to be something</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.610" end="00:31:07.960" style="s2">more than well-being that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:12.010" style="s2">enough but I like sacred I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.960" end="00:31:13.450" style="s2">think the last time yeah well I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.010" end="00:31:15.130" style="s2">sacred is important because sacred</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.450" end="00:31:19.510" style="s2">points too</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.130" end="00:31:21.600" style="s2">we need something that right makes us</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.510" end="00:31:26.590" style="s2">feel like we&#39;re connected to something</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.600" end="00:31:28.840" style="s2">larger than our egos more real than our</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.590" end="00:31:31.240" style="s2">own are sort of individual subject</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.840" end="00:31:33.670" style="s2">subjective perspective that also</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.240" end="00:31:36.430" style="s2">challenges and demands us to transform</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.670" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">in order to get some very deep truths</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.430" end="00:31:38.710" style="s2">about ourselves and each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.710" end="00:31:49.540" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s what we need just</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">well-being isn&#39;t enough the reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.540" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">opening part of sacredness I totally get</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:58.990" style="s2">now I think there&#39;s one more aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:01.840" style="s2">it though for example I really love Jude</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.990" end="00:32:04.420" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of those things which it</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.840" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">gets deeper that more I get into it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.420" end="00:32:10.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a reciprocal opening there but</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:13.390" style="s2">how do I know how do I know judo is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.540" end="00:32:16.510" style="s2">sacred to me versus I just really really</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.390" end="00:32:18.580" style="s2">you know well the thing is when</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.510" end="00:32:21.610" style="s2">something is sacred it should it starts</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.580" end="00:32:25.000" style="s2">to be like I think we said it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.610" end="00:32:26.740" style="s2">become so I&#39;m you I use Corbin&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.530" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">becomes an image not in your head but an</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:32:57.790" style="s2">that generalizes is it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:00.970" style="s2">powerful portal an image that is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.790" end="00:33:04.390" style="s2">continual portal right for that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.970" end="00:33:07.179" style="s2">reciprocal opening in many areas of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.390" end="00:33:10.289" style="s2">life it starts to generalize and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.179" end="00:33:12.519" style="s2">so that and and I my strongest</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.289" end="00:33:14.019" style="s2">realization for that was when I was had</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.019" end="00:33:19.359" style="s2">and I was just as you said I was just</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.940" end="00:33:20.979" style="s2">really enjoying it but my close friends</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.359" end="00:33:22.899" style="s2">and colleagues started saying to me well</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.979" end="00:33:26.049" style="s2">what&#39;s happening to you you&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.899" end="00:33:27.399" style="s2">to think and write differently and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.049" end="00:33:28.469" style="s2">weren&#39;t seen me doing Tai Chi John they</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.399" end="00:33:31.989" style="s2">were seeing me within an academic</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.469" end="00:33:35.979" style="s2">context that&#39;s how when it starts to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.989" end="00:33:39.879" style="s2">permeate right and when it starts to act</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.979" end="00:33:43.389" style="s2">as a parameter on all of you that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.879" end="00:33:44.679" style="s2">interactional space both the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.389" end="00:33:46.629" style="s2">interactional and the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.679" end="00:33:48.309" style="s2">interactional that&#39;s when I think it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.629" end="00:33:49.719" style="s2">starts to become mythos for you it</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.309" end="00:33:55.960" style="s2">starts to become something that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.719" end="00:33:58.359" style="s2">sacred for you oh okay okay so we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.960" end="00:34:01.469" style="s2">reciprocal on this as kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.359" end="00:34:05.849" style="s2">mechanism but happens and then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.469" end="00:34:09.899" style="s2">connection with or yeah with mythos</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.849" end="00:34:13.270" style="s2">doing an active form together and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.899" end="00:34:15.099" style="s2">did mythos well think about you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.270" end="00:34:16.929" style="s2">in judo you&#39;re actually enacting all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.099" end="00:34:18.760" style="s2">these different postures and ways of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.929" end="00:34:21.190" style="s2">thinking and seeing and being and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.760" end="00:34:24.490" style="s2">interacting with other human beings now</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.190" end="00:34:26.770" style="s2">these are all image schemata that really</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.490" end="00:34:28.809" style="s2">transform your access to yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.770" end="00:34:30.970" style="s2">other people in the world at least if</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.809" end="00:34:33.250" style="s2">it&#39;s pursued Safiye entually I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.970" end="00:34:36.279" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing judo you know as it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.250" end="00:34:36.819" style="s2">intended right it you know or Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.279" end="00:34:38.379" style="s2">Chuan</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.819" end="00:34:41.619" style="s2">of course it&#39;s a martial art for</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.379" end="00:34:44.559" style="s2">self-defense but it&#39;s also meant to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.619" end="00:34:46.149" style="s2">much more profound transformation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.559" end="00:34:49.899" style="s2">supposed to be a wisdom right</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.149" end="00:34:53.109" style="s2">cultivation practice yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.899" end="00:34:57.460" style="s2">actually call it a religion yes it the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.109" end="00:35:00.730" style="s2">way that yeah yeah it&#39;s just interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.460" end="00:35:03.250" style="s2">though right like um when we use that</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.730" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">word in English we don&#39;t think of oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.250" end="00:35:09.339" style="s2">going to the dojo and and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:12.940" style="s2">train for a couple hours but in Japan in</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.339" end="00:35:15.309" style="s2">the places where they these come from it</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.940" end="00:35:19.839" style="s2">really is a religion it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.309" end="00:35:20.670" style="s2">they&#39;re very formal yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.839" end="00:35:23.190" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.670" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">there&#39;s sacred space the dojo which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.190" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">like the temple right you have you have</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:32.609" style="s2">the bearer of the tradition you have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:34.140" style="s2">master who&#39;s a guide and he he or she is</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.609" end="00:35:36.660" style="s2">not just trying to teach you they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.140" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">trying to mentor you and inspire you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.660" end="00:35:40.650" style="s2">transformation right it I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:43.650" style="s2">again talking the ideal there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.650" end="00:35:46.020" style="s2">trappy dojos and right I&#39;m not denying</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.650" end="00:35:48.060" style="s2">any of this but but I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.020" end="00:35:50.010" style="s2">I mean when when judo becomes that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.060" end="00:35:53.250" style="s2">comprehensive way of life that&#39;s bound</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.010" end="00:35:55.800" style="s2">up with enacted mythos and acted ritual</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.250" end="00:35:57.420" style="s2">enacted transformation enacted getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.800" end="00:35:59.160" style="s2">together communing with other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.420" end="00:36:00.869" style="s2">training with other people transforming</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.160" end="00:36:08.070" style="s2">with other people yes it&#39;s a religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.869" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">very much okay I want to bring some</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.070" end="00:36:15.270" style="s2">truth about now well I just kind of want</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:18.869" style="s2">to share with you my thoughts because</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.270" end="00:36:21.390" style="s2">this has come up in this past month you</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.869" end="00:36:26.430" style="s2">know especially with kovat 19 and like</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.390" end="00:36:33.300" style="s2">this is an incredible time and of course</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.430" end="00:36:36.119" style="s2">but more than that it uh someone like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.300" end="00:36:39.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit point or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.119" end="00:36:42.180" style="s2">where it&#39;s or a lightning rod or some</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.390" end="00:36:45.780" style="s2">everything that&#39;s happening is is being</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.180" end="00:36:49.650" style="s2">a handstand exaggerated and exacerbated</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.780" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2">times thousand million so for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.650" end="00:36:55.320" style="s2">actually how China responded exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:58.040" style="s2">I had expected them nervous now America</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.320" end="00:37:02.490" style="s2">responded exactly how I expected them to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.040" end="00:37:07.290" style="s2">respond but the consequences of very</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.490" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">pronounced but what I think the main wet</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.290" end="00:37:13.560" style="s2">and problem is now is hyper logos I</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:16.260" style="s2">think that&#39;s really comes down to is two</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.560" end="00:37:21.859" style="s2">logos by that I mean I don&#39;t mean in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.260" end="00:37:21.859" style="s2">divine sense I&#39;m doing like rationality</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.070" end="00:37:30.180" style="s2">figure out your problems said of doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.040" end="00:37:33.720" style="s2">your problem well so first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.180" end="00:37:34.510" style="s2">would yeah I I wouldn&#39;t want to equate</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.720" end="00:37:39.460" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.510" end="00:37:42.430" style="s2">with logos with rationality precisely</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.460" end="00:37:43.570" style="s2">because as you said logos is a much if</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.430" end="00:37:45.490" style="s2">you even look at it philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.570" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">going back to Heraclitus and then all</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.490" end="00:37:49.480" style="s2">the way through the Stoics and in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:52.690" style="s2">neoplatonist and plato it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.480" end="00:37:55.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it shouldn&#39;t be idea the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.690" end="00:37:58.930" style="s2">that human rationality can participate</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.780" end="00:38:02.800" style="s2">in the logos but kind of the model for</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.930" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">the logos isn&#39;t sort of human reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.800" end="00:38:10.119" style="s2">also I guess what I where I would push</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:12.520" style="s2">back a bit is that I think figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.119" end="00:38:14.950" style="s2">your problems is what you&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.520" end="00:38:17.470" style="s2">regardless and that the issue I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.950" end="00:38:20.380" style="s2">what you&#39;re objecting to you is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.470" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">of a purely propositional form of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.380" end="00:38:26.859" style="s2">rationality and this is part of what</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:22.120" style="s2">their brilliant work have shown that the</p>

<p begin="00:40:22.120" end="00:40:25.810" style="s2">be an inferential process</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.560" end="00:40:29.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t infer your way to becoming</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.810" end="00:40:30.670" style="s2">more rational and so I mean what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.500" end="00:40:33.370" style="s2">have to do is you have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.670" end="00:40:36.550" style="s2">some fundamental transformations that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.370" end="00:40:38.680" style="s2">actually make you more rational and</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.550" end="00:40:41.370" style="s2">wiser that involves transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.680" end="00:40:43.990" style="s2">perspective transformation of identity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.370" end="00:40:46.650" style="s2">transformation of the skills you bring</p>

<p begin="00:41:05.740" end="00:41:09.910" style="s2">bring back all these other kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:41:16.300" end="00:41:24.790" style="s2">how it was really I really like that and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.620" end="00:41:28.990" style="s2">agree with it I&#39;m looking back in my</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.790" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">experience I&#39;ve been living all over the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.990" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">East for so many years and I maybe I can</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:44.050" style="s2">just I hope you can help me draw out</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:46.500" style="s2">what the problem is here it could</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.050" end="00:41:49.690" style="s2">individual it may be its hyper</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.500" end="00:41:53.470" style="s2">individuality that I would agree with</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.690" end="00:41:57.430" style="s2">see so but that came up in my recent</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.470" end="00:41:59.320" style="s2">voices with Ravi ki with my friend and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.430" end="00:42:02.170" style="s2">colleague Greg on reeks and I released</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.320" end="00:42:05.170" style="s2">it actually yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.170" end="00:42:07.240" style="s2">so here&#39;s three other m&#39;s for you that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.170" end="00:42:11.890" style="s2">want to challenge right we have this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.240" end="00:42:17.410" style="s2">idea largely that comes out of Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.890" end="00:42:19.030" style="s2">and about sort of reason as Mohana logic</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.410" end="00:42:22.330" style="s2">it&#39;s something you do as a monologue</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.030" end="00:42:25.530" style="s2">with yourself and there&#39;s increasing</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.330" end="00:42:28.780" style="s2">evidence reason evolved to work</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.530" end="00:42:32.190" style="s2">biologically that we actually reasoned</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.780" end="00:42:35.890" style="s2">best in the sense of overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.190" end="00:42:39.430" style="s2">self-deception and generating new ideas</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.890" end="00:42:42.910" style="s2">that enhance our connectedness we do</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.430" end="00:42:45.100" style="s2">that best in distributed cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.910" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">then of course there&#39;s the mono phasic</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.100" end="00:42:49.960" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s only one the state</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:52.930" style="s2">of consciousness one state of identity</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.960" end="00:42:55.810" style="s2">that you should be in in order to gain</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.930" end="00:42:58.570" style="s2">knowledge whereas of course in the East</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.810" end="00:43:00.400" style="s2">as you&#39;re saying it they have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.570" end="00:43:02.380" style="s2">polyphasic culture this is work I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:05.130" style="s2">doing with Daniel Craig we&#39;re know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.380" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">multiple states of consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.130" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">multiple senses of identity and being</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:15.520" style="s2">are really actually needed in order for</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.680" end="00:43:17.350" style="s2">people to grow into wisdom and I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.520" end="00:43:20.080" style="s2">we&#39;re coming to realize especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.350" end="00:43:21.550" style="s2">within developmental science and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.080" end="00:43:23.470" style="s2">developmental psychology developmental</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.910" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">even see a highly logical and rational</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.760" end="00:43:36.040" style="s2">systems like stoicism you have practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">designed to alter state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.040" end="00:43:41.230" style="s2">alter perspective or knowing like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:44.230" style="s2">view from above so you want to reject a</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.230" end="00:43:51.430" style="s2">monolithic right that the that the mind</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.870" end="00:43:55.480" style="s2">is right just is just propositional</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.430" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">knowing right that so you got to break</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.480" end="00:43:59.590" style="s2">out of all of those and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:02.140" style="s2">that is individualism tends to emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.590" end="00:44:04.270" style="s2">our version of individualism tends to</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.140" end="00:44:05.740" style="s2">emphasize all of that but what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.270" end="00:44:08.440" style="s2">empirical research is showing is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.740" end="00:44:12.330" style="s2">individualist cultures are actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:14.560" style="s2">poorer at detecting self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.330" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">engaging in self correction than more</p>

<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:18.940" style="s2">cultures have their difficulties -</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.700" end="00:44:35.110" style="s2">here&#39;s the other thing right just we</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.220" end="00:44:36.700" style="s2">have to resist the equation of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.110" end="00:44:40.930" style="s2">individualism which is it with a</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.420" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">course very good evidence that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.650" end="00:45:02.230" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require the particular</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:04.330" style="s2">ideological framework that we call you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.230" end="00:45:08.290" style="s2">know modern individualism which i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.330" end="00:45:12.160" style="s2">is something we need to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.290" end="00:45:13.810" style="s2">more critical of so that&#39;s I would agree</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.160" end="00:45:17.290" style="s2">with you I think that&#39;s a deep point</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.810" end="00:45:20.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a very deep point there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:45:20.470" end="00:45:27.210" style="s2">love most about most of these Eastern</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.210" end="00:45:34.870" style="s2">in Chinese especially there are like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.060" end="00:45:39.160" style="s2">dozen ways to say yes or no question</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.870" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">tags at thee so the typical way the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.160" end="00:45:44.470" style="s2">Chinese speak and also true for Thais</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:48.190" style="s2">Vietnamese it&#39;s this is the room away</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.470" end="00:45:52.150" style="s2">here you say a statement and then yes or</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.190" end="00:45:54.330" style="s2">no and like it there&#39;s literally a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.150" end="00:45:58.290" style="s2">different ways to do this in Chinese so</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.330" end="00:46:02.080" style="s2">because I think that&#39;s one big reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.290" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">they can kind of say really well they</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.080" end="00:46:07.480" style="s2">can stay collective because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:10.330" style="s2">always pushing for a yes or a n&#39;t or</p>

<p begin="00:46:10.330" end="00:46:15.370" style="s2">actually okay because at least you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.910" end="00:46:18.370" style="s2">that you disagree so you can still kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.370" end="00:46:20.890" style="s2">of be still be together and and work</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.370" end="00:46:24.520" style="s2">through it until you get to the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.890" end="00:46:28.510" style="s2">agreement it&#39;s always pushing further</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.520" end="00:46:30.060" style="s2">towards agreement whereas English oh my</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.510" end="00:46:32.670" style="s2">goodness I really don&#39;t like English</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.060" end="00:46:35.490" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s there&#39;s so many opinions</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.670" end="00:46:39.990" style="s2">and it&#39;s and it&#39;s all it&#39;s great for</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.490" end="00:46:43.730" style="s2">poetry right and music and and this sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.990" end="00:46:45.990" style="s2">of stuff but like detecting</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.730" end="00:46:49.230" style="s2">self-deception in ourselves and others</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.990" end="00:46:51.540" style="s2">the the Chinese and the other eight and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.230" end="00:46:55.530" style="s2">languages here they give give you a huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.540" end="00:46:59.190" style="s2">leg up because that it&#39;s very binary and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.530" end="00:47:01.650" style="s2">very loyal and quick to see what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.190" end="00:47:04.110" style="s2">on you know I think that&#39;s right I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.650" end="00:47:08.430" style="s2">that makes sense that you would that</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.110" end="00:47:13.500" style="s2">you&#39;d find that those features yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.430" end="00:47:16.170" style="s2">the that I mean my understanding is that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.500" end="00:47:18.150" style="s2">there&#39;s their disagreement is understood</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.170" end="00:47:21.810" style="s2">as opponent processing which is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.150" end="00:47:23.490" style="s2">biological form of of self regulation</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.810" end="00:47:26.610" style="s2">right where you have few systems that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.490" end="00:47:28.230" style="s2">are constantly acting as you know checks</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.610" end="00:47:30.300" style="s2">and balances and pushing and pulling</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.230" end="00:47:32.250" style="s2">each other and because then the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.300" end="00:47:34.530" style="s2">that that&#39;s how the process of self</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.250" end="00:47:37.800" style="s2">correction has actually created opponent</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.530" end="00:47:40.620" style="s2">processing and so what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.800" end="00:47:43.140" style="s2">the West and this is you know with work</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.620" end="00:47:45.600" style="s2">I did with Leo Ferraro is that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.140" end="00:47:48.000" style="s2">opponent process and has has devolved</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.600" end="00:47:50.760" style="s2">into a purely adversarial</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.000" end="00:47:53.040" style="s2">winner-take-all processing where bots</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.760" end="00:47:57.090" style="s2">file on IKEA the love of victory which</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">Plato argues is the biggest obstacle to</p>

<p begin="00:48:04.500" end="00:48:09.720" style="s2">so the point about deal logos is to</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.390" end="00:48:11.970" style="s2">bring back finally as Sophia as an</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.720" end="00:48:13.800" style="s2">alternative to finally on IKEA the love</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.970" end="00:48:18.600" style="s2">of victory and bring back instead the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.800" end="00:48:20.760" style="s2">love of wisdom so dialectic is to try</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:22.820" style="s2">and reverse engineer the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.760" end="00:48:25.680" style="s2">technology the meta psycho technology</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.820" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">that will bring this about and then when</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.680" end="00:48:30.090" style="s2">you get into that state it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:31.530" style="s2">collective flow state in which you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.090" end="00:48:34.230" style="s2">you can definitely disagree but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.530" end="00:48:36.110" style="s2">a point of processing because then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.230" end="00:48:37.890" style="s2">write there&#39;s both negative and positive</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.110" end="00:48:39.720" style="s2">disagreement you can disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.890" end="00:48:41.130" style="s2">somebody you say no and you&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.720" end="00:48:43.500" style="s2">holding back and when we&#39;ve prioritized</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.130" end="00:48:49.110" style="s2">that barring that as oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.500" end="00:48:50.850" style="s2">primary way but there&#39;s also the what</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.110" end="00:48:52.260" style="s2">you might call positive to scream it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.850" end="00:48:54.420" style="s2">where&#39;s your at you you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.260" end="00:48:55.890" style="s2">further or deeper a riff on what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.420" end="00:48:57.840" style="s2">person has said you want to provoke</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.890" end="00:48:59.700" style="s2">right and if and if these two are held</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.840" end="00:49:02.340" style="s2">together as equally valuable the overall</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.700" end="00:49:04.650" style="s2">project is can you and I get to a place</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.340" end="00:49:06.420" style="s2">together where you couldn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.650" end="00:49:09.300" style="s2">individually and where I couldn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.420" end="00:49:10.830" style="s2">individually and that when that starts</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.300" end="00:49:13.200" style="s2">to happen and we start to get a cascade</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.830" end="00:49:16.110" style="s2">of those we start to get a flow of being</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.200" end="00:49:18.990" style="s2">in a place where you know getting to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.110" end="00:49:20.580" style="s2">place in our insight in our</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.990" end="00:49:22.140" style="s2">intelligibility our ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.580" end="00:49:23.610" style="s2">sense of ourselves each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.140" end="00:49:25.800" style="s2">world if we can get to a place that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.610" end="00:49:27.900" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get to individually and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.800" end="00:49:30.660" style="s2">you know we&#39;re getting to flow my friend</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.900" end="00:49:32.790" style="s2">layman Pascal calls this overflow which</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.660" end="00:49:35.370" style="s2">is a wonderful term if we can get into</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.790" end="00:49:40.200" style="s2">overflow I think that is where we do our</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.370" end="00:49:42.780" style="s2">best reasoning and our best our best</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.200" end="00:49:45.720" style="s2">transformation and we also feel at our</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.780" end="00:49:47.130" style="s2">best we this is a way of what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.720" end="00:49:48.750" style="s2">like this is how human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:51.560" style="s2">supposed to live how they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.750" end="00:49:56.670" style="s2">dwell with each other and on the earth</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.560" end="00:50:00.540" style="s2">yes that&#39;s the feeling of Judo for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.670" end="00:50:06.990" style="s2">yes yep judo is doing that same thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.540" end="00:50:10.320" style="s2">that that dialectic flow in a physical</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.990" end="00:50:11.310" style="s2">domain and that&#39;s all sort of i yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.320" end="00:50:16.890" style="s2">yeah go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.310" end="00:50:19.380" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s why that&#39;s my that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.890" end="00:50:23.460" style="s2">why I brought in the Socratic prayer is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.380" end="00:50:26.760" style="s2">is is to its brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.460" end="00:50:31.080" style="s2">you know what we&#39;re doing in that way so</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.760" end="00:50:35.160" style="s2">we have a better way just hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.080" end="00:50:38.130" style="s2">it&#39;ll work better that&#39;s all I do want</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.160" end="00:50:40.440" style="s2">to say again I forgot I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.130" end="00:50:42.900" style="s2">one more time though he thought sorry to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.440" end="00:50:44.610" style="s2">interrupt to you know I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.900" end="00:50:46.860" style="s2">again though that I don&#39;t want to you I</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.610" end="00:50:48.780" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want to put on a pedestal right</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.860" end="00:50:52.520" style="s2">collectivist cultures because they also</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.780" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">they&#39;re also problematic in certain ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.520" end="00:50:57.410" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:50:58.490" style="s2">I just want I just wanted to state that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.410" end="00:50:59.810" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s not where the</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.490" end="00:51:01.880" style="s2">conversations going right now so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.810" end="00:51:03.290" style="s2">want to derail it but I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.880" end="00:51:04.370" style="s2">misinterpreting on this point either</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.290" end="00:51:11.870" style="s2">right No</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.370" end="00:51:13.490" style="s2">so go ahead so though clear to me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.870" end="00:51:16.700" style="s2">really interesting I&#39;ve never studied</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.490" end="00:51:21.230" style="s2">prayer I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only done it a few</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.700" end="00:51:24.770" style="s2">times but the one time I did it really</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.230" end="00:51:27.740" style="s2">worked it was it was really simple an</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.770" end="00:51:31.520" style="s2">effective process which I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.740" end="00:51:36.920" style="s2">is better than decision so what I do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:39.980" style="s2">I have an intention and I pride it or</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.920" end="00:51:44.540" style="s2">desire even and I try to clear by it in</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.980" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">my mind and then I express it to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.540" end="00:51:51.980" style="s2">world or to God and then let go let go</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:55.700" style="s2">of any outcome that&#39;ll happen from that</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.980" end="00:51:58.040" style="s2">and just repeat that process and the one</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.700" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">time I did it that it worked instantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.040" end="00:52:04.850" style="s2">and I got into this incredible focused</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">state of learning which I haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.850" end="00:52:10.930" style="s2">into since yeah there are powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:13.280" style="s2">I mean so prayer is biological in nature</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.930" end="00:52:17.450" style="s2">and when so there&#39;s research showing</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.280" end="00:52:18.920" style="s2">that when people pray so they had like</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.450" end="00:52:21.260" style="s2">an experiment with the head people pray</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.920" end="00:52:23.330" style="s2">to God who were believers in God versus</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.260" end="00:52:27.350" style="s2">praying to Santa Claus in very different</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.330" end="00:52:28.790" style="s2">parts of the brain are activated and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.350" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">prayer is a way of getting into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.790" end="00:52:36.410" style="s2">dialogical mode with right with your</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:37.250" style="s2">relationship two aspects of that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.410" end="00:52:40.100" style="s2">mysterious to you of your own</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.250" end="00:52:42.770" style="s2">unconscious and then also aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.100" end="00:52:44.060" style="s2">world that are mysterious to you you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.770" end="00:52:45.020" style="s2">know because they&#39;re the depths of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.060" end="00:52:46.700" style="s2">world and what the world is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.020" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">combinatorially explosive and complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.700" end="00:52:53.080" style="s2">and so prayer is a way of putting you</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:58.190" style="s2">into a dynamic sort of biological</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.080" end="00:52:59.930" style="s2">preparedness that can really access your</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.190" end="00:53:02.540" style="s2">relevance realization machinery and some</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.930" end="00:53:06.440" style="s2">very very powerful ways and help to</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.540" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">sensitize you to well as you said to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.440" end="00:53:10.010" style="s2">learning to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:11.819" style="s2">patterns you didn&#39;t see before and</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:16.380" style="s2">realizing things you didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.819" end="00:53:19.230" style="s2">before and I I don&#39;t believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.380" end="00:53:21.569" style="s2">supernatural for lots of reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.230" end="00:53:25.010" style="s2">I&#39;ve articulated elsewhere and so on</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.569" end="00:53:28.109" style="s2">I don&#39;t think of prayer as a key voting</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.010" end="00:53:31.109" style="s2">supernatural forces on our behalf but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.109" end="00:53:36.240" style="s2">do acknowledge that prayer can have that</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.109" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">effect of putting people into a powerful</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.619" end="00:53:50.280" style="s2">an answer from the world in that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.510" end="00:53:52.020" style="s2">that they realize and see things they</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.280" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t otherwise realize and see</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.020" end="00:53:55.950" style="s2">that&#39;s why there&#39;s many forms of Prayer</p>

<p begin="00:54:26.790" end="00:54:33.420" style="s2">new patterns that are important for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.940" end="00:54:38.520" style="s2">challenge you face so yeah that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.420" end="00:54:40.549" style="s2">would that&#39;s my take on that okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.520" end="00:54:43.410" style="s2">excellent</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.549" end="00:54:46.770" style="s2">full disclosure I&#39;ve been fasting today</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.410" end="00:54:50.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m realizing that&#39;s why I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.770" end="00:54:58.140" style="s2">thinking I&#39;m all pulled up and a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.940" end="00:55:02.790" style="s2">tired but once we start did I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.140" end="00:55:05.760" style="s2">like my badness turned on which isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.790" end="00:55:10.770" style="s2">another important word is faith and</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.760" end="00:55:13.380" style="s2">you&#39;re like prayer are we acknowledge II</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.770" end="00:55:16.290" style="s2">right so I would faith fit in within</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.380" end="00:55:17.579" style="s2">religion are the three atoms yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.290" end="00:55:19.079" style="s2">well I&#39;m having a lot of really good</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.579" end="00:55:20.890" style="s2">discussions about this with you know</p>

<p begin="00:55:20.890" end="00:55:33.610" style="s2">so I Jordan all I think of faith up you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:37.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a practice but a full</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.610" end="00:55:40.090" style="s2">person practice that couples the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.720" end="00:55:42.010" style="s2">emergence of mind so I don&#39;t mean new</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.090" end="00:55:44.470" style="s2">ideas I mean that like developmental</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.010" end="00:55:46.600" style="s2">emerging the way an adults mind emerges</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.470" end="00:55:48.910" style="s2">from a child&#39;s mind the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.600" end="00:55:51.430" style="s2">mind to the emergence of the world so</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.910" end="00:55:54.850" style="s2">what patterns that are emerging that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.430" end="00:55:57.700" style="s2">crucial for you like to zero in on is</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.850" end="00:56:02.950" style="s2">really relevant in really mattering and</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.700" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">so faith in that sense is the decoupling</p>

<p begin="00:59:55.490" end="01:00:02.570" style="s2">means to be a really well developed</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.810" end="01:00:06.380" style="s2">character is we you could call</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.570" end="01:00:11.000" style="s2">detachment or indifference so someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.380" end="01:00:15.260" style="s2">who is totally beyond the crisis won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:00:19.010" end="01:00:26.870" style="s2">don&#39;t even talk about it and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:29.060" style="s2">romanticize the language so in these</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.870" end="01:00:31.700" style="s2">they&#39;re they have a work or coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.060" end="01:00:34.790" style="s2">it&#39;s like being done it&#39;s two syllables</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.700" end="01:00:37.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a very simple word and as far as I</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.790" end="01:00:39.640" style="s2">know that&#39;s all they talk about it but</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.220" end="01:00:43.370" style="s2">in do you have flatten the curve and</p>

<p begin="01:00:43.370" end="01:00:48.760" style="s2">contract tracing oars like there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.340" end="01:00:51.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole new language of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.760" end="01:00:54.980" style="s2">developing now and to me that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.650" end="01:00:58.670" style="s2">the opposite way that you want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.980" end="01:01:01.580" style="s2">the the developed character says this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.670" end="01:01:04.070" style="s2">just you know this is a little like</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.580" end="01:01:07.310" style="s2">hiccup and I&#39;ll just you know do some</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.070" end="01:01:12.050" style="s2">breathing and then it goes away and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.310" end="01:01:15.740" style="s2">opposite way is that oh my god things</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.050" end="01:01:18.230" style="s2">going on and well I guess what I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.740" end="01:01:21.110" style="s2">say about that is I agree with the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.230" end="01:01:22.790" style="s2">developed character I mean but that</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.110" end="01:01:24.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference right in that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.790" end="01:01:28.130" style="s2">know the China has it&#39;s at all Jen</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.130" end="01:01:33.010" style="s2">of what needed to be done the West&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.680" end="01:01:34.330" style="s2">you know Western democracies we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.010" end="01:01:38.910" style="s2">talk a lot about it because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.330" end="01:01:41.320" style="s2">the government operates I you know I</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.910" end="01:01:44.110" style="s2">well I would appeal to Aristotle to you</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.320" end="01:01:48.330" style="s2">on this right my I think detachment</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.110" end="01:01:52.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean indifference at least not</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.330" end="01:01:55.150" style="s2">the sense of yeah yeah they&#39;re not same</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.420" end="01:01:58.060" style="s2">thing that so airs though you know air</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.150" end="01:01:59.470" style="s2">so example is anger it&#39;s famously is</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.060" end="01:02:02.230" style="s2">anger he says you know the point is not</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.470" end="01:02:03.700" style="s2">to be angry or not angry the point is to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.230" end="01:02:06.400" style="s2">be angry at the right time for the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.700" end="01:02:09.640" style="s2">reasons to the right degree right and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.400" end="01:02:12.520" style="s2">think so I think bringing our problems</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.640" end="01:02:14.740" style="s2">solving abilities to bear on this</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.520" end="01:02:16.990" style="s2">individually and collectively you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.740" end="01:02:18.760" style="s2">at the right time for the right reasons</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.990" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">to the right degree is what we should be</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.760" end="01:02:22.120" style="s2">doing and I think that&#39;s gonna look</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:24.340" style="s2">different for different cultures because</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.120" end="01:02:25.570" style="s2">different cultures have organized or</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.340" end="01:02:27.490" style="s2">organized politically and</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.570" end="01:02:29.020" style="s2">socioeconomically differently so they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.490" end="01:02:31.560" style="s2">have to dispose of their resources in</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.020" end="01:02:35.260" style="s2">different ways I do think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.560" end="01:02:36.670" style="s2">that and I like what Jordan Hall has to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.260" end="01:02:38.950" style="s2">say but is he said we have to steer</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.670" end="01:02:41.530" style="s2">between what he calls pent panic and</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.950" end="01:02:44.500" style="s2">anti panic panic is like your time with</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.530" end="01:02:45.730" style="s2">people right an anti panic that people</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.500" end="01:02:47.470" style="s2">are just saying oh there&#39;s nothing there</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.730" end="01:02:49.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a hoax it&#39;s not real we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.470" end="01:02:51.430" style="s2">to do anything and we got to avoid both</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.630" end="01:02:54.520" style="s2">of those I mean it&#39;s the golden mean of</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.430" end="01:02:56.230" style="s2">Aristotle we have to find that and I</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.520" end="01:02:58.450" style="s2">think that&#39;s the mark of good character</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.230" end="01:02:59.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s goes back to again the person</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.450" end="01:03:02.800" style="s2">who has the gold Amin is the person who</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.770" end="01:03:04.840" style="s2">can stay in continuity of contact with</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.800" end="01:03:07.240" style="s2">the situations because they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.840" end="01:03:09.970" style="s2">polarized in two extremes so they can</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.240" end="01:03:11.950" style="s2">stay and shift with things as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.970" end="01:03:14.130" style="s2">moving so that&#39;s that&#39;s how I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.950" end="01:03:20.440" style="s2">that&#39;s how I&#39;d respond to what you said</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.130" end="01:03:23.050" style="s2">okay okay cool so another thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.440" end="01:03:25.390" style="s2">been noticing this is also why I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.050" end="01:03:28.570" style="s2">chosen ethos and non doesn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.390" end="01:03:32.260" style="s2">because do all different dimensions live</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.570" end="01:03:36.940" style="s2">on so to me that the cultural dimension</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.260" end="01:03:40.470" style="s2">is is qualitatively higher than social</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.940" end="01:03:40.470" style="s2">political economical</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.660" end="01:03:46.930" style="s2">yeah well I really feel that so well</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.410" end="01:03:49.450" style="s2">well yes we can see the Chinese system</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.930" end="01:03:52.090" style="s2">is better equipped to handle such a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.450" end="01:03:55.150" style="s2">thing which it is what&#39;s really more</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.090" end="01:03:59.020" style="s2">important is the culture so I agree with</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.150" end="01:04:00.910" style="s2">you on staying around here is like when</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.020" end="01:04:02.260" style="s2">it&#39;s the middle of the virus or before</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.910" end="01:04:04.150" style="s2">after they&#39;re just they&#39;re still just</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.260" end="01:04:05.770" style="s2">Chinese people you know they still they</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.150" end="01:04:09.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like nothing has happened for them</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.770" end="01:04:13.630" style="s2">because they that&#39;s their culture they</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.150" end="01:04:17.260" style="s2">like there could be just thousands of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.630" end="01:04:19.510" style="s2">years of non-stop cultivation character</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.260" end="01:04:22.180" style="s2">and whatever else they&#39;ve been doing but</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.510" end="01:04:27.190" style="s2">they just there&#39;s no panic</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.180" end="01:04:30.550" style="s2">they don&#39;t want really telling example</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.190" end="01:04:33.790" style="s2">of this was uh there&#39;s a video of an old</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.550" end="01:04:35.620" style="s2">lady being you know quarantine by the</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.790" end="01:04:38.710" style="s2">police into a van and she was saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.620" end="01:04:42.310" style="s2">kill me kill me now that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.710" end="01:04:44.920" style="s2">interesting because she&#39;s being literal</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.310" end="01:04:55.570" style="s2">she&#39;s she&#39;s not saying I can&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.920" end="01:04:57.940" style="s2">saying I just uh I&#39;m I&#39;m over all of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.570" end="01:05:01.480" style="s2">this and the fact they give me any kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.940" end="01:05:04.210" style="s2">of trouble it&#39;s like just kill me and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.480" end="01:05:07.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different response from me</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.210" end="01:05:11.020" style="s2">very different Wes oh yeah I agree I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.870" end="01:05:13.660" style="s2">agree that the cultural level is really</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.020" end="01:05:15.100" style="s2">important I do I think I think it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.660" end="01:05:18.010" style="s2">more important than the political level</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.100" end="01:05:22.900" style="s2">or the socio-economic level I do I agree</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.010" end="01:05:27.070" style="s2">with you on that it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to see</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.900" end="01:05:31.560" style="s2">some you know I don&#39;t want to go too</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.070" end="01:05:36.280" style="s2">much into the modern event stuff oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.560" end="01:05:42.220" style="s2">here&#39;s thing in my notes that I think an</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.280" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">interesting relate transcend since the</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.220" end="01:05:51.040" style="s2">that whole game of like how to make</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:54.190" style="s2">sense of the world and like and is this</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.040" end="01:05:57.930" style="s2">fake news is this real news when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.190" end="01:06:01.720" style="s2">fully grounded and religion that process</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.930" end="01:06:05.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it disappears but it it</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.720" end="01:06:07.300" style="s2">becomes pushed down to a much like lower</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.470" end="01:06:07.960" style="s2">level where it&#39;s not as important</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.300" end="01:06:12.030" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.960" end="01:06:15.490" style="s2">does that make sense I think so I I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.030" end="01:06:16.930" style="s2">I I mean Paul Van de CLE has this</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.490" end="01:06:19.360" style="s2">wonderful thing where he says politics</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.930" end="01:06:22.450" style="s2">is about the now and religion is about</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.360" end="01:06:25.120" style="s2">the always and so religion tends to put</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.450" end="01:06:28.090" style="s2">you into the the domain of perennial</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.120" end="01:06:29.200" style="s2">problems and perennial patterns and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.090" end="01:06:32.950" style="s2">those are these are much more</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.200" end="01:06:36.100" style="s2">comprehensive long-term bigger scope and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.950" end="01:06:37.660" style="s2">in that sense what we find significant</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.100" end="01:06:40.120" style="s2">or what we find really matters are</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.660" end="01:06:41.620" style="s2">salience landscaping really changes</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.120" end="01:06:44.260" style="s2">that&#39;s why you do for the view from</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.620" end="01:06:46.420" style="s2">above at the same point like it changes</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.260" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">you when you do the view from the bub</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.420" end="01:06:50.200" style="s2">you see the bigger picture as we say the</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:52.590" style="s2">bigger patterns right the things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.200" end="01:06:55.900" style="s2">actually matter across time and space</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.590" end="01:06:57.370" style="s2">more reliably and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.900" end="01:07:00.220" style="s2">things that religion does is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.370" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">that it puts you into a participatory</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.220" end="01:07:05.110" style="s2">contact with these bigger patterns these</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:07.870" style="s2">perennial patterns these perennial</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.110" end="01:07:09.910" style="s2">problems and in that sense it alters</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.870" end="01:07:12.010" style="s2">what you care about we&#39;re back to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.910" end="01:07:13.540" style="s2">Socrates well you know educating what</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.010" end="01:07:15.160" style="s2">you care about and caring about it in</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.540" end="01:07:17.560" style="s2">the right way into the right degree and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.160" end="01:07:21.040" style="s2">this is Aristotle - you know he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.560" end="01:07:25.150" style="s2">grandson of Socrates right that is I</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.040" end="01:07:27.070" style="s2">mean intellectually I mean that dad that</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.150" end="01:07:31.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.070" end="01:07:34.110" style="s2">right that and when people who live well</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.420" end="01:07:36.520" style="s2">again when would the religion is about</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.110" end="01:07:39.820" style="s2">well we&#39;ve been talking about enhancing</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.520" end="01:07:42.460" style="s2">religio and ameliorating self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.820" end="01:07:43.810" style="s2">and affording wisdom then it does all of</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.460" end="01:07:45.910" style="s2">that of course but religion can also be</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.810" end="01:07:49.510" style="s2">a place where people go to play politics</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.910" end="01:07:52.180" style="s2">and play socio-economic games and to</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.510" end="01:07:54.070" style="s2">pursue ideology and to oppress other</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.180" end="01:07:59.530" style="s2">people I mean so we again we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.070" end="01:08:01.950" style="s2">about I know a particular way of</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.530" end="01:08:06.810" style="s2">understanding religion in its ideal form</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.950" end="01:08:09.150" style="s2">yeah I need to get going soon ethos</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.810" end="01:08:11.160" style="s2">uh sorry I wanted to give you also a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.150" end="01:08:14.490" style="s2">chance I didn&#39;t to just end like if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.160" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">want you wanted you know sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.490" end="01:08:17.180" style="s2">summative thing we can come to it you</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:20.040" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.180" end="01:08:24.920" style="s2">yes yes thanks</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.040" end="01:08:31.050" style="s2">I think that&#39;s good timing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.920" end="01:08:34.350" style="s2">there&#39;s too many different threads here</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.050" end="01:08:37.140" style="s2">right so yeah something hope I hope we</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.350" end="01:08:42.510" style="s2">can really make some kind of summary</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.140" end="01:08:48.030" style="s2">here something about okay how about this</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.510" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">but just faith it sounded a lot like</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.030" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">connectedness today and a lot like</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:58.160" style="s2">religio so yes tell me what do you think</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:09:03.680" style="s2">how do those correlate I think faith is</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.160" end="01:09:08.220" style="s2">a commitment to a wise way of being that</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.680" end="01:09:24.710" style="s2">has the capacity to reliably enhance</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.220" end="01:09:24.710" style="s2">religio mm okay Oh perfect you say that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.069" end="01:09:32.850" style="s2">the the lack of mythos is the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.600" end="01:09:37.680" style="s2">that separates a wisdom culture from</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.850" end="01:09:39.600" style="s2">widget um I don&#39;t know I think I mean</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.680" end="01:09:40.830" style="s2">look at the example with judo oh you</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.600" end="01:09:44.819" style="s2">called it a religion because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.830" end="01:09:46.170" style="s2">hard to find people cultivating because</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.819" end="01:09:48.150" style="s2">like I said it&#39;s part what&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.170" end="01:09:51.450" style="s2">three M&#39;s right it&#39;s very hard to find</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.150" end="01:09:54.300" style="s2">people cultivating wisdom that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.450" end="01:09:56.550" style="s2">getting involved with mythos right mando</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.300" end="01:09:59.790" style="s2">we talked about Neoplatonism I think the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.550" end="01:10:01.650" style="s2">mythos is right and mythos means not</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.790" end="01:10:05.700" style="s2">just images it also means actions</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.650" end="01:10:08.490" style="s2">rituals right gestures things like that</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.700" end="01:10:12.270" style="s2">I think that you&#39;re gonna find mythos</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.490" end="01:10:14.070" style="s2">wherever people are aspiring to you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.270" end="01:10:16.460" style="s2">comprehensive transformation and</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.070" end="01:10:16.460" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.160" end="01:10:21.660" style="s2">because that&#39;s the only way to access a</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.260" end="01:10:22.620" style="s2">lot of this machinery it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.660" end="01:10:25.200" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about with prayer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.620" end="01:10:27.960" style="s2">there&#39;s certain ways of being or that</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.200" end="01:10:32.100" style="s2">that&#39;s how we access both you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.960" end="01:10:33.540" style="s2">within you know the levels of the psyche</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.100" end="01:10:36.720" style="s2">and within the levels of the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.540" end="01:10:38.640" style="s2">that&#39;s the only there&#39;s ways the you</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.720" end="01:10:41.340" style="s2">know there are indispensable to us in</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.640" end="01:10:44.070" style="s2">accessing those those levels and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.340" end="01:10:46.980" style="s2">where mythos those enacted imaginal</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.070" end="01:10:51.300" style="s2">patterns are just indispensable to us I</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.980" end="01:10:55.560" style="s2">I think the difference is between a</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.300" end="01:10:57.480" style="s2">wisdom tradition and religion and if we</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.560" end="01:10:58.530" style="s2">want to make a distinction I think the</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.480" end="01:11:03.480" style="s2">only place you&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.530" end="01:11:05.850" style="s2">make a distinction is when you&#39;re again</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.480" end="01:11:09.030" style="s2">where we&#39;re back to making worship the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.850" end="01:11:11.970" style="s2">defining feature of religion rather than</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.030" end="01:11:13.200" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom and and then</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.970" end="01:11:16.530" style="s2">again I think we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.200" end="01:11:18.590" style="s2">circularity of what we&#39;re just only the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.530" end="01:11:20.940" style="s2">Abrahamic religions are religions which</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.590" end="01:11:22.410" style="s2">okay if that&#39;s what you want to do but I</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.940" end="01:11:28.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know that does I don&#39;t have that</p>
