<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:24.729" style="s2">yeah my think mines probably many layers</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.530" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">ended up getting a hold of was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.460" style="s2">notion that you could actually do things</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:11.140" style="s2">when you could imagine what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.460" end="00:04:14.440" style="s2">consequences of your actions might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.140" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">quite a distance down the road and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.440" end="00:04:16.090" style="s2">could actually really really good at</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:17.230" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.090" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">to the point you could actually sit</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.230" end="00:04:20.830" style="s2">there and hear someone to describe a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.790" end="00:04:24.100" style="s2">plan to you and you could listen to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.830" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">plan and go that won&#39;t work right and be</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.100" end="00:04:27.580" style="s2">very confident that in fact that plans</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">on a good plan I mean an example might</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.580" end="00:04:31.990" style="s2">be I&#39;m going to walk up to the fireplace</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:33.580" style="s2">and point my hands I didn&#39;t say light</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.990" end="00:04:34.150" style="s2">and I&#39;ll say well you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.580" end="00:04:35.770" style="s2">gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.150" end="00:04:36.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a good model of how reality</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.770" end="00:04:37.270" style="s2">works I&#39;ve done this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.910" end="00:04:39.220" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.270" end="00:04:41.890" style="s2">bad plan all right so what I found</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.220" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">though was that as I absorb more and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.890" end="00:04:45.190" style="s2">more life experience and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:47.560" style="s2">knowledge I began to be noticed that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.190" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">more and more often more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.560" end="00:04:52.300" style="s2">people&#39;s plans were of that sort and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:53.920" style="s2">that was like well that&#39;s interesting so</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.300" end="00:04:54.910" style="s2">I took that as an object of inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.920" end="00:04:58.390" style="s2">by the way again</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.910" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">my own being first and foremost so okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.390" end="00:05:02.020" style="s2"> long-term planning is not working</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:05.110" style="s2">out so I got you know kept going okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.020" end="00:05:07.450" style="s2">how can you actually make effective</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.110" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">choices how can you actually plan at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.450" end="00:05:12.460" style="s2">about what&#39;s gonna happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.860" end="00:05:15.850" style="s2">and what I began to notice was the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.460" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about like everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.850" end="00:05:20.290" style="s2">that we currently believe that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:21.640" style="s2">plan won&#39;t work like none of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.290" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">that we have in our tool kit that allows</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.640" end="00:05:25.420" style="s2">us to make plans for the future is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:26.950" style="s2">work out fill in the blank I pick any</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.420" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">problem I kept running the situations</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.950" end="00:05:30.520" style="s2">for people to describe a particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">problem everything we&#39;re going to solve</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:34.060" style="s2">climate we&#39;re gonna solve conflict we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">gonna solve education and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.060" end="00:05:36.250" style="s2">just sort of listen to them talking</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:37.780" style="s2">about their plan and going well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.250" end="00:05:39.550" style="s2">not gonna work not only is that not</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.780" end="00:05:42.220" style="s2">gonna work it&#39;s gonna work like terribly</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.550" end="00:05:44.200" style="s2">what&#39;s happening so this led me to then</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.220" end="00:05:47.200" style="s2">finally looking at it okay what might</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.200" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">and then that began the process of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.200" end="00:05:51.820" style="s2">saying okay how do we actually get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:56.889" style="s2">the point where we can begin to get some</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.820" end="00:06:02.889" style="s2">level of clarity on what might actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.889" end="00:06:05.169" style="s2">be a meaningful step and that leads me</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.889" end="00:06:09.180" style="s2">here that this is the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.169" end="00:06:12.580" style="s2">question the answer of recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.180" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">the question of sense making together is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.580" end="00:06:20.500" style="s2">ultimately a question of how do I make</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.200" end="00:06:23.070" style="s2">better choices and how do I and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.500" end="00:06:25.419" style="s2">become a we who make better choices</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.070" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">hopefully in some context the builds to</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.419" end="00:06:28.810" style="s2">us collectively actually being able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.860" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">make the kinds of better choices that</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.110" end="00:06:58.990" style="s2">this is we&#39;ve talked about it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:22.360" style="s2">was really effective and that blew all</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.090" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">they had to start competing with each</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.120" end="00:08:22.600" style="s2">Dunbar what the limitation of the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.700" style="s2">coherence was that it couldn&#39;t scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.600" end="00:08:27.220" style="s2">past about a hundred and fifty people so</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.610" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">our ability to embody models of other</p>

<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:49.209" style="s2">going on but any of it game a then says</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:51.129" style="s2">all right how do I</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.209" end="00:08:54.009" style="s2">solve the problem of scale while</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.990" end="00:09:07.990" style="s2">from the inside how do I avoid</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.990" end="00:09:13.240" style="s2">that and how do I actually create enough</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.119" end="00:09:14.470" style="s2">power inside that that group that it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:16.059" style="s2">actually compete now with other groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.470" end="00:09:17.499" style="s2">right now of course we had the whole</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.499" end="00:09:22.569" style="s2">the solution the game a comes up with is</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.869" end="00:09:24.779" style="s2">this entire store there&#39;s society mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.569" end="00:09:27.100" style="s2">paradigms think of it it&#39;s like almost</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.779" end="00:09:29.139" style="s2">computational actuation that simplifies</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.100" end="00:09:31.509" style="s2">human relationships and puts them in</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.139" end="00:09:33.809" style="s2">very simple relationships to have inputs</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.730" end="00:09:42.879" style="s2">down in a book and repeat it over and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.259" end="00:09:43.869" style="s2">over again and simplified there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.879" end="00:09:46.269" style="s2">to it but I want I mean we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.869" end="00:09:48.459" style="s2">forever so then we fast-forward it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.269" end="00:09:50.589" style="s2">okay game a has a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.459" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">inside its possibilities space so it can</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.589" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">we deliver on the Ming Dynasty and Rome</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:59.379" style="s2">and the Prussians and 21st century u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.819" style="s2">sorry those are all inside the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.379" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">game a can be but they&#39;re all variations</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.819" end="00:10:05.860" style="s2">on that theme we come to where we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:07.480" style="s2">now the problems that we&#39;re facing or a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.860" end="00:10:09.759" style="s2">different set of problems right and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.480" end="00:10:13.569" style="s2">problems we run into now is that game a</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.759" end="00:10:17.139" style="s2">in and of itself can&#39;t ultimately deal</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.569" end="00:10:18.549" style="s2">with complexity both complexity in terms</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:42.779" style="s2">that it always goes through some kind of</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.559" end="00:10:51.179" style="s2">on the outside and then the third is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:53.649" style="s2">thing that we talked about which is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.179" end="00:10:56.499" style="s2">precisely because it is so effective at</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.649" end="00:10:58.060" style="s2">power on an underlying premise of</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.700" end="00:11:13.300" style="s2">all right so game a runs to the limits</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.350" end="00:11:15.190" style="s2">of its of its boundary conditions it</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.300" end="00:11:18.040" style="s2">can&#39;t solve those three fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.190" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">problems in Evin of itself so something</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.040" end="00:11:22.900" style="s2">new has to be developed so it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.860" end="00:11:24.700" style="s2">well that&#39;s game B just literally we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.900" end="00:11:26.860" style="s2">just defining a place it&#39;s a pointer to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.700" end="00:11:28.540" style="s2">something over here so like a wool what</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.860" end="00:11:30.130" style="s2">is that the first thing is the reason</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.540" end="00:11:31.210" style="s2">why we can name it game B is to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.130" end="00:11:34.120" style="s2">what&#39;s something that is in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.210" end="00:11:35.860" style="s2">different game altogether so go over to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.120" end="00:11:38.710" style="s2">the basis it&#39;s something on the order of</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.860" end="00:11:43.510" style="s2">magnitude of the difference between the</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.820" end="00:11:50.770" style="s2">happened in civilization since then that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.800" end="00:11:53.050" style="s2">whole box is different right that order</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.770" end="00:11:56.710" style="s2">of magnitude and it has characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.050" end="00:11:59.080" style="s2">that allow it to actually actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.710" end="00:12:01.630" style="s2">address these three questions and their</p>

<p begin="00:12:05.560" end="00:12:08.950" style="s2">what does that look like what are some</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.000" end="00:12:09.790" style="s2">characteristics of that and that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.950" end="00:12:13.120" style="s2">of the things we&#39;ve been talking about</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.120" end="00:12:16.840" style="s2">least as I&#39;ve gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.190" end="00:12:18.280" style="s2">questioning of this over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.840" end="00:12:20.080" style="s2">over again it recognized for example</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.280" end="00:12:21.430" style="s2">that you have to change the mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.080" end="00:12:25.180" style="s2">otherwise you just recapitulate the</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.430" end="00:12:27.100" style="s2">society is this thing we&#39;ve been calling</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.100" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">coherence specifically is at the very</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:39.520" style="s2">even talked about has a bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:42.010" style="s2">Taoist sense to it as you&#39;re naming it</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.520" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">in the context of game a quite often</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.010" end="00:12:45.580" style="s2">you&#39;re actually importing gaming into it</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:47.470" style="s2">so you have to actually treat it very</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:53.860" style="s2">just being able to do it it is the kind</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.200" end="00:13:00.280" style="s2">how you can become capable of it but</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.270" end="00:13:02.230" style="s2">designing it talking about it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.280" end="00:13:03.010" style="s2">generally a full fundamental error that</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.230" end="00:13:05.149" style="s2">does that make sense what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.010" end="00:13:09.379" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.149" end="00:13:14.660" style="s2">I mean I think just depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.379" end="00:13:16.160" style="s2">taoist we imagine game B to be well</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.660" end="00:13:18.410" style="s2">that&#39;s very odd because if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">actually be taoist interestingly enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.410" end="00:13:22.670" style="s2">but it can actually be it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:25.279" style="s2">the taoist insight that points to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.670" end="00:13:27.170" style="s2">dow but i can say very clearly if i</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.279" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">could articulate it my definition is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.170" end="00:13:29.779" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:31.579" style="s2">it&#39;s not complicated game b is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.779" end="00:13:35.420" style="s2">complicated game b must be intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.579" end="00:13:38.569" style="s2">complex so i cannot define it in any</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.569" end="00:13:42.829" style="s2">finite set of statements it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.339" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">complicated so it&#39;s not that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.829" end="00:13:47.149" style="s2">thing so if I&#39;m explaining if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.189" style="s2">describing it I have to be doing it in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.149" end="00:13:51.949" style="s2">something which is essentially poetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.189" end="00:13:53.899" style="s2">not a specification or as daniel said</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.949" end="00:13:55.790" style="s2">i&#39;m pointing towards the generator</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.899" end="00:14:00.069" style="s2">functions they give rise to something</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.790" end="00:14:00.069" style="s2">that is more than the thing that is said</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.840" end="00:14:09.430" style="s2">noticing three distinct things to come</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:11.380" style="s2">up one is the question of why why did</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.430" end="00:14:14.280" style="s2">this thing which I&#39;ll just call</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.380" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">coherence that we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.280" end="00:14:28.810" style="s2">the the second is why does it thus far</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:34.000" style="s2">fail to scale and then of course the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.810" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">third is how might we do about solving</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.000" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">that problem all three seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:41.950" style="s2">showing up close to each other and my</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:44.770" style="s2">sense do you want to share more what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.950" end="00:14:48.520" style="s2">mean by coherence right immediately what</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.770" end="00:14:49.990" style="s2">comes up so what is this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.520" end="00:14:51.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.990" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">talking about it but we might say</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.310" end="00:14:57.340" style="s2">there&#39;s ah actually it&#39;s interesting it</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:14:59.530" style="s2">seems like you actually have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.340" end="00:15:01.540" style="s2">about it in many different ways because</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.530" end="00:15:08.200" style="s2">it is the kind of thing that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.540" end="00:15:10.540" style="s2">conveyed effectively in language you</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.200" end="00:15:13.450" style="s2">know it&#39;s the matrix unfortunately no</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.540" end="00:15:14.860" style="s2">one can be told what coherence is but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.450" end="00:15:17.260" style="s2">can&#39;t actually tell a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.860" end="00:15:19.450" style="s2">stories it&#39;s become the blind with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.260" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">elephant and after a little while we</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.450" end="00:15:24.340" style="s2">might be able to in ourselves grasp</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:33.460" style="s2">perhaps what is being pointed out so one</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.340" end="00:15:36.400" style="s2">way of describing it is it is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.460" end="00:15:39.780" style="s2">form of collective intelligence that has</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.400" end="00:15:39.780" style="s2">as a characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:56.180" style="s2">a high degree of capacity in the space</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.769" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">of novelty and a intrinsic antifragility</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.180" end="00:16:08.670" style="s2">in both human and throw poke complexity</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:11.670" style="s2">and nature complexity another way of</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.670" end="00:16:12.750" style="s2">saying that is if you work backwards in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.670" end="00:16:14.579" style="s2">taking a look at all the different</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.750" end="00:16:19.070" style="s2">challenges and problems that we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.579" end="00:16:23.820" style="s2">currently facing we meaning Humanity is</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.070" end="00:16:29.459" style="s2">the answer to the set that contains</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.820" end="00:16:35.220" style="s2">those problems another way of describing</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.459" end="00:16:37.500" style="s2">it is it&#39;s something like flow since we</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.220" end="00:16:43.640" style="s2">have that as a nice concrete frame then</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.500" end="00:16:47.790" style="s2">we can invoke that in an unconstrained</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.640" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">way I often times associate with flow</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.790" end="00:16:53.760" style="s2">with flow in a domain a rock-climber is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:16:56.839" style="s2">in flood when climbing rocks a jazz band</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.760" end="00:17:01.949" style="s2">is in flow and playing jazz coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.839" end="00:17:07.530" style="s2">flow absent a context absent a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.949" end="00:17:10.620" style="s2">particular location you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.530" end="00:17:15.929" style="s2">mentioned you said it has a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.620" end="00:17:17.429" style="s2">with novelty what prompts you to put</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.929" end="00:17:19.620" style="s2">that into the mix because if I just hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.429" end="00:17:21.630" style="s2">the word coherence so that just feels</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:23.640" style="s2">let you know from physics electronics</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.630" end="00:17:26.220" style="s2">whatever it would just be things in some</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.640" end="00:17:29.970" style="s2">form of sync with each other but you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.220" end="00:17:32.790" style="s2">added in novelty and antifragility and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.970" end="00:17:33.660" style="s2">brothers have seem interesting but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.790" end="00:17:36.660" style="s2">they&#39;re not what I would have just</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.660" end="00:17:41.220" style="s2">expected to come from the word so can</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.660" end="00:17:45.690" style="s2">you help unpack either the Y or the how</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.220" end="00:17:48.270" style="s2">you got to those yeah I think also to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.690" end="00:17:51.380" style="s2">begin it&#39;s I think what you bring up is</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.270" end="00:17:53.130" style="s2">good we should just say that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.380" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">different kinds of collective</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.130" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.050" style="s2">some kinds of collective intelligence we</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">have different names for with my call</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.050" end="00:18:04.430" style="s2">them different things so in this context</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:07.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to be very familiar</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.430" end="00:18:09.410" style="s2">with the notion that word choice is</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.430" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">oftentimes going to require some careful</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.410" end="00:18:13.430" style="s2">definition as you just did so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:15.650" style="s2">for everyone who&#39;s listening just</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.430" end="00:18:17.570" style="s2">recognize that oftentimes I have a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.650" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">certain vocabulary daniel has vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.570" end="00:18:21.260" style="s2">you have a vocabulary we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:24.050" style="s2">operating under what I&#39;ve called rule</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.260" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">Omega which is listen to what is being</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.050" end="00:18:28.250" style="s2">expressed not what is being said and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:29.630" style="s2">asked good questions until what is being</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.250" end="00:18:33.140" style="s2">expressed as actually felt that&#39;s landed</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.630" end="00:18:36.710" style="s2">so if we think about the examples of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.140" end="00:18:38.780" style="s2">flow you&#39;ve provided so well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.710" end="00:18:41.060" style="s2">things that shows up so commonly is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.780" end="00:18:44.330" style="s2">sense of there being an emergence or a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.060" end="00:18:46.130" style="s2">synergy where there&#39;s something about a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.330" end="00:18:49.430" style="s2">whole that is greater than the sum of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.130" end="00:18:54.560" style="s2">the parts and that as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.430" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">happens to be the best way to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.560" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">novelty</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.690" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">let me add some words that I think might</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.560" end="00:19:09.540" style="s2">add clarity to the question you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">asking we&#39;ve discussed offline some</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.540" end="00:19:15.040" style="s2">different types of coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:16.750" style="s2">different contexts and like formal</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.040" end="00:19:19.360" style="s2">models for looking at what coherence in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.750" end="00:19:21.670" style="s2">different contexts means and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.360" end="00:19:22.300" style="s2">mention like physics like things of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.670" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">same type</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.300" end="00:19:28.540" style="s2">like pendulums or lasers that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:29.410" style="s2">coherence of sameness they all become</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.540" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">the same wavelength</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.410" end="00:19:36.730" style="s2">they have the same periodicity and when</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:39.720" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about humans being able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.730" end="00:19:44.200" style="s2">come into coherence we&#39;re not wanting a</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.720" end="00:19:46.450" style="s2">homogenizing coherence and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.200" end="00:19:49.090" style="s2">about something like a body liver cells</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.450" end="00:19:51.220" style="s2">and neurons and fat cells are all very</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.090" end="00:19:53.140" style="s2">different types of cells and yet they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.220" end="00:19:55.570" style="s2">operating in a way where the body is an</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.070" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">a coherence of different things where</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.380" end="00:20:06.370" style="s2">the difference is the basis of synergy</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.810" end="00:20:48.010" style="s2">said it&#39;s kind of like flow if we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.060" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">of flow from fluid dynamics in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.010" end="00:20:54.550" style="s2">like laminar flow versus turbulent flow</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:56.500" style="s2">there&#39;s a more flow is less entropy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.550" end="00:20:59.620" style="s2">actually not just less entropy buts</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.500" end="00:21:01.860" style="s2">entropy the movement towards holes that</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.620" end="00:21:03.610" style="s2">have greater than some of the parts and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.860" end="00:21:05.020" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.610" end="00:21:06.730" style="s2">interested in and collective sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.020" end="00:21:08.110" style="s2">making is how do we come together in</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.730" end="00:21:11.260" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.110" end="00:21:14.230" style="s2">that has less friction less entropy</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.260" end="00:21:17.740" style="s2">relationally Moore&#39;s entropy where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.230" end="00:21:19.390" style="s2">group of us has capacities has emergent</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.740" end="00:21:23.590" style="s2">properties that aren&#39;t found in any of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.390" end="00:21:26.409" style="s2">us in isolation the coherence is that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.590" end="00:21:29.110" style="s2">phenomena that emergent properties arise</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.409" end="00:21:31.659" style="s2">from right and then so the the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.110" end="00:21:37.210" style="s2">distinction was we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.659" end="00:21:38.980" style="s2">examples of this kind that have never</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.210" end="00:21:40.630" style="s2">actually able to get pretty nuanced so</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.980" end="00:21:43.179" style="s2">we&#39;ll just be careful about that were</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.630" end="00:21:44.679" style="s2">getting nuanced we have a particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.179" end="00:21:46.779" style="s2">kind of coherence but I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.679" end="00:21:49.899" style="s2">label coordination just we have a label</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.779" end="00:21:52.149" style="s2">for it and this has a lot of wittiness</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.899" end="00:21:54.429" style="s2">talking about in fact it has emergent</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.149" end="00:21:57.370" style="s2">properties so for example if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.429" end="00:22:02.740" style="s2">a mathematician having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.370" end="00:22:04.809" style="s2">with an economist there&#39;s in fact a hole</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.740" end="00:22:06.700" style="s2">in their conversation that is greater</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.809" end="00:22:08.230" style="s2">than the sum of the parts there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.700" end="00:22:10.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a connection between those two</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.230" end="00:22:11.919" style="s2">ways of thinking the toolkits of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.600" end="00:22:13.659" style="s2">mathematics that&#39;s not available to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.919" end="00:22:15.100" style="s2">economist unlocks things the economists</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.659" end="00:22:17.230" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have known about but for</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.100" end="00:22:18.669" style="s2">example the economists questions there</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.230" end="00:22:19.720" style="s2">weren&#39;t things the mathematician was</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.669" end="00:22:20.740" style="s2">thinking about unlocks things the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.720" end="00:22:24.450" style="s2">mathematician wasn&#39;t thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.740" end="00:22:27.010" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a synergy value to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:28.450" style="s2">that&#39;s also not the thing we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.010" end="00:22:31.809" style="s2">about that&#39;s awesome</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.450" end="00:22:34.139" style="s2">really good useful but for very specific</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.809" end="00:22:37.649" style="s2">reasons which we can go to if we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.139" end="00:22:44.529" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.649" end="00:22:46.419" style="s2">to satisfy the requirements of call it</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.529" end="00:22:47.350" style="s2">the problems that we&#39;re facing Kant said</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.419" end="00:22:49.899" style="s2">if I just set aside the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.350" end="00:22:52.600" style="s2">nature implicitly it can&#39;t satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.899" end="00:22:53.669" style="s2">problems event ropo complexity one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.600" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">which is why it keeps breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.669" end="00:22:56.950" style="s2">every time we try to build something</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">like the San trope of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.950" end="00:23:02.980" style="s2">oftentimes it becomes the primary reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:05.230" style="s2">why it breaks down yeah I mean it seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.980" end="00:23:09.309" style="s2">like if I&#39;m hearing right the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.230" end="00:23:12.360" style="s2">is just how how can we get together with</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.309" end="00:23:16.409" style="s2">each other in a way that leaves us</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:19.770" style="s2">smarter kinda more creative more</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.409" end="00:23:26.250" style="s2">courageous more resilient</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.770" end="00:23:30.809" style="s2">than any of us are a part and me at</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.250" end="00:23:32.490" style="s2">least as far as terms for me flow is</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.809" end="00:23:34.440" style="s2">often a bit of a buzzword and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.490" end="00:23:35.790" style="s2">lot of people project onto it but some</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.440" end="00:23:37.860" style="s2">slightly more precise like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.790" end="00:23:39.300" style="s2">thinking of examples and you can tell me</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.860" end="00:23:42.809" style="s2">if I&#39;m barking up the right tree or not</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.300" end="00:23:45.179" style="s2">but like examples I think of is Victor</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.809" end="00:23:47.730" style="s2">Turner&#39;s notion at University of Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.179" end="00:23:49.740" style="s2">of communitas which is a it&#39;s not simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.730" end="00:23:53.940" style="s2">a collection it&#39;s not just a crowd or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.740" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">mob it&#39;s a felt presence of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.940" end="00:23:59.610" style="s2">among a group and then you think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:01.559" style="s2">like Quakers use the term like gathered</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.610" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">meeting there&#39;s a regular meeting we all</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.559" end="00:24:05.280" style="s2">shuffle under the meeting house</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:07.290" style="s2">no one says much and people or even</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.280" end="00:24:08.850" style="s2">people may say a few things and that can</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.290" end="00:24:10.260" style="s2">not be a gathered meeting that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.850" end="00:24:12.660" style="s2">physical collection of humans on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.260" end="00:24:16.710" style="s2">Sunday morning but a gathered meeting is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.660" end="00:24:18.929" style="s2">there you know over centuries of really</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.710" end="00:24:22.020" style="s2">delicate listening into that is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.929" end="00:24:25.650" style="s2">place where you&#39;re speaking only when</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.020" end="00:24:27.300" style="s2">spoken through know that the collective</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.650" end="00:24:29.750" style="s2">intelligence is given voice through a</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.300" end="00:24:34.530" style="s2">given individual but it&#39;s clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.750" end="00:24:38.520" style="s2">just their thoughts ideas or words does</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.530" end="00:24:41.850" style="s2">that try yes for you guys okay now I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.520" end="00:24:43.470" style="s2">know obviously analogies of humans and</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.850" end="00:24:44.580" style="s2">brains and minds to computers are</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.470" end="00:24:46.410" style="s2">obviously problematic and a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.580" end="00:24:48.929" style="s2">of different levels but as far as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.410" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">simple one does this also seem to be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.929" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">notion of connecting CPUs or computers</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:57.600" style="s2">in serial such that the connected</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:59.070" style="s2">computational power and capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.600" end="00:25:00.420" style="s2">greater than any of the things in</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">between and that they might actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.420" end="00:25:05.490" style="s2">even be able to tackle problems that at</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:10.500" style="s2">any individual computer would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.490" end="00:25:12.420" style="s2">uncapable of solving actually no and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.500" end="00:25:15.630" style="s2">that goes back to the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.420" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">coordination so that style of connection</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.630" end="00:25:21.050" style="s2">is coordination and it does have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:23.340" style="s2">characteristic of increasing capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.050" end="00:25:26.059" style="s2">and in fact increasing capacity in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.340" end="00:25:26.059" style="s2">fashion that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.900" end="00:25:32.160" style="s2">well at least depending on the specific</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:35.040" style="s2">kind of problem and the physical</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.160" end="00:25:36.120" style="s2">capacity to do compute often times it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.040" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">better to polish you for solving</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.120" end="00:25:41.730" style="s2">particular kinds of problems that make</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:43.020" style="s2">sense so I just said it does I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.730" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">winning is there a magic in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.020" end="00:25:46.440" style="s2">supercomputer is there a like for</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:47.970" style="s2">instance if all I can do is let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.440" end="00:25:50.160" style="s2">back 20 years you know and if all I</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.970" end="00:25:51.660" style="s2">could do is do email and AOL you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.160" end="00:25:52.920" style="s2">but if we connected up enough of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.660" end="00:25:54.870" style="s2">together we can actually project a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.920" end="00:25:57.060" style="s2">hologram and actually you know model</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.870" end="00:25:59.400" style="s2">something totally new and different but</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.060" end="00:26:01.320" style="s2">none of those things couldn&#39;t do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.400" end="00:26:02.490" style="s2">if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a problematic metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.320" end="00:26:03.960" style="s2">we can abandoned I&#39;m just thinking no</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.490" end="00:26:06.510" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very good metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.960" end="00:26:08.010" style="s2">and problematic I don&#39;t know about it we</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.510" end="00:26:10.410" style="s2">actually want to have it be helpfully</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.010" end="00:26:12.810" style="s2">double-click on why yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.410" end="00:26:15.120" style="s2">elements of parallel processing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.810" end="00:26:17.340" style="s2">elements of serial processing that are</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.120" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">important and then there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.340" end="00:26:22.220" style="s2">that can&#39;t be fully contained in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:24.900" style="s2">parallel and serial and the thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.220" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">am sensing Jordan&#39;s calling coherence is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.900" end="00:26:29.010" style="s2">what is our we do we have a model where</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:31.080" style="s2">we&#39;re reducing consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.010" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">computation and if not what</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.080" end="00:26:35.070" style="s2">consciousness is other than computation</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">is part of the limits of that model yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.070" end="00:26:38.930" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know where this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:41.370" style="s2">but I think it might be yeah Union</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.930" end="00:26:43.050" style="s2">analysis perhaps but the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.370" end="00:26:44.460" style="s2">third they talked about in like dyadic</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.050" end="00:26:46.920" style="s2">relationships and sometimes they&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.460" end="00:26:49.860" style="s2">do couples therapy whether it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.920" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2">like you know a plate for Elijah or you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.860" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">know like a seat for Elvis it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:56.910" style="s2">there&#39;s the third and the third is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:59.100" style="s2">intelligence of the relationship and is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.910" end="00:27:02.190" style="s2">the third you know a working place the</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.100" end="00:27:05.930" style="s2">idea that there is between among us but</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.190" end="00:27:10.290" style="s2">not specific to any of us an additional</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.930" end="00:27:12.270" style="s2">intelligence that can emerge and that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.290" end="00:27:14.280" style="s2">that that is that the differentiator</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.270" end="00:27:16.980" style="s2">between what you were describing as</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.280" end="00:27:19.020" style="s2">coherence and simply maybe collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.980" end="00:27:22.080" style="s2">intelligence or processing your</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.020" end="00:27:28.490" style="s2">coordination yep okay very I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.080" end="00:27:31.620" style="s2">yes okay yeah and so I&#39;m wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.490" end="00:27:34.320" style="s2">translate different ontology listeners</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.620" end="00:27:36.270" style="s2">might be coming from and say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.320" end="00:27:37.710" style="s2">couple at least a couple different ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.270" end="00:27:39.070" style="s2">we can think about this both of which</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.710" end="00:27:44.470" style="s2">are meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.070" end="00:27:47.260" style="s2">so there&#39;s a question of can we come</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.470" end="00:27:50.380" style="s2">into a type of relationship as beings</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.260" end="00:27:52.810" style="s2">where there is a kind of synergy a kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.380" end="00:27:55.780" style="s2">of coherence where there&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.810" end="00:27:58.990" style="s2">emergent property of something on deck</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.780" end="00:28:01.420" style="s2">that then has a top-down effect in us we</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.990" end="00:28:03.040" style="s2">can actually listen to that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.420" end="00:28:05.410" style="s2">some interesting kind of metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.040" end="00:28:08.050" style="s2">propositions that would make that be the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.410" end="00:28:11.230" style="s2">case and I would say that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.050" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">and then there&#39;s also the well if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.230" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">and mind is still processing in separate</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">brains is there still something we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:25.660" style="s2">intending to listen into the group as</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:30.760" style="s2">opposed to just myself and just having</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.660" end="00:28:32.740" style="s2">the intention to consider the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.760" end="00:28:34.630" style="s2">perspectives of everyone there consider</p>

<p begin="00:28:34.630" end="00:28:39.090" style="s2">consider the group as a whole not just</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.160" end="00:28:42.580" style="s2">the individuals and the individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.090" end="00:28:45.730" style="s2">speak what could be relevant and useful</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.580" end="00:28:47.790" style="s2">for everyone and feel think about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.730" end="00:28:51.730" style="s2">and feel into it use your whole self I</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.790" end="00:28:53.650" style="s2">don&#39;t have to have a ontology of an</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.730" end="00:28:56.830" style="s2">emergent collective consciousness to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.650" end="00:28:59.680" style="s2">have that process be a useful thing so</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.830" end="00:29:02.470" style="s2">is there a point Jordan is is it helpful</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.680" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">or problematic to consider so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.470" end="00:29:09.160" style="s2">what you just said which is let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:11.710" style="s2">it super skillful active collective</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.160" end="00:29:13.330" style="s2">listening right where it&#39;s it you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.710" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">take first person second person third</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.330" end="00:29:20.050" style="s2">person perspectives fluidly in order to</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.050" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">make sense of as much information and</p>

<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">feels sort of secular humanist rational</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.440" end="00:29:30.760" style="s2">that&#39;s just us being better people</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:32.670" style="s2">playing better together is there</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.760" end="00:29:37.470" style="s2">anything - what is gained and lost by</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.540" end="00:29:52.630" style="s2">traditional societies they might have</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.070" end="00:29:54.820" style="s2">some wild-ass crazy ritual</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.630" end="00:29:57.070" style="s2">like in Haitian Vodou or something like</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.820" end="00:29:58.840" style="s2">that and there may be the there is a God</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.070" end="00:30:02.020" style="s2">or a spirit that this ritual is</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.840" end="00:30:05.140" style="s2">dedicated to and when enough of us lose</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.020" end="00:30:07.060" style="s2">our separate sin itself they would they</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.140" end="00:30:08.350" style="s2">would tell the story or make the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.060" end="00:30:10.210" style="s2">that that is when the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.350" end="00:30:13.260" style="s2">such-and-such has come through right if</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.210" end="00:30:18.490" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about post rational</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.260" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">coherence is there a thing that is super</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.490" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">ordinate to us if so is that helpful</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:26.560" style="s2">in the sense of like get out of the way</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.580" end="00:30:29.250" style="s2">all right we&#39;re laying in the mothership</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.560" end="00:30:32.020" style="s2">or is it problematic because it creates</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.250" end="00:30:33.670" style="s2">magical thinking projections and other</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.020" end="00:30:35.020" style="s2">stuff well interestingly I think we</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.670" end="00:30:40.540" style="s2">actually have a nice self referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.020" end="00:30:41.950" style="s2">that just happens right here because so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.540" end="00:30:44.860" style="s2">the first step might be something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.950" end="00:30:45.940" style="s2">something I call paradigm mapping Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.860" end="00:30:48.250" style="s2">actually did paradigm happening I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.940" end="00:30:51.310" style="s2">gonna go so you take a particular story</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.250" end="00:30:54.280" style="s2">that somebody&#39;s telling and you point by</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.310" end="00:30:55.630" style="s2">point map it to a particular paradigm so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.280" end="00:30:57.850" style="s2">I could describe that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.630" end="00:31:00.010" style="s2">cognitive science and say okay what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.850" end="00:31:04.060" style="s2">really happening is that when we create</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.010" end="00:31:06.790" style="s2">a proposition that there&#39;s a third what</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.060" end="00:31:08.620" style="s2">this does in our own minds is that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.790" end="00:31:09.910" style="s2">allows us to no longer have an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.620" end="00:31:12.790" style="s2">attachment to the rightness or wrongness</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.910" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">a particular idea which gives rise to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.790" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">cognitive capacity to be more creative</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">more fluid in explorations and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:22.930" style="s2">is a more generative way it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:24.700" style="s2">form of hack that allows us to have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.930" end="00:31:27.880" style="s2">cognitive disposition right so I just</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.700" end="00:31:29.590" style="s2">did a mapping to a kind of language in</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.880" end="00:31:31.210" style="s2">cognitive science that would take</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.590" end="00:31:33.580" style="s2">somebody who loads and runs cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.210" end="00:31:35.320" style="s2">science as a sense making framework and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.580" end="00:31:37.210" style="s2">make them go okay that makes sense feels</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.320" end="00:31:38.410" style="s2">good my I don&#39;t feel scared or angry</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.210" end="00:31:41.380" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening right now that</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.410" end="00:31:44.050" style="s2">feels like a feasible thing but of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.380" end="00:31:46.360" style="s2">course the meta proposition is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.050" end="00:31:51.310" style="s2">mapping it to a paradigm full-stop at</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.360" end="00:31:53.410" style="s2">all is the problem so anytime you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.310" end="00:31:55.330" style="s2">actually trying to make sense by mapping</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.410" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">to a paradigm whether the paradigm is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.330" end="00:32:01.150" style="s2">you know Vishnu or the God pan or</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:05.560" style="s2">cognitive neuroscience or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.150" end="00:32:06.340" style="s2">you&#39;re already recapturing the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.560" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.340" end="00:32:13.480" style="s2">particular way of thinking that limits</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.929" style="s2">its capacity to be the thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.480" end="00:32:20.590" style="s2">trying to actually do so the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.929" end="00:32:22.179" style="s2">the question is like if the answer is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.590" end="00:32:23.860" style="s2">question like the classic Buddhist just</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.179" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">whacking in the back of the head like</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.860" end="00:32:28.029" style="s2">that&#39;s the only real response to that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.659" style="s2">kind of a question is don&#39;t go that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.029" end="00:32:32.260" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.659" end="00:32:36.820" style="s2">sure okay so so yes and then but he so</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.260" end="00:32:39.820" style="s2">if coherence is this ephemeral emergent</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.820" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">property best never named the never</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.820" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">subject to reality captured reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:47.049" style="s2">tunnel capture like if that thing then</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:49.299" style="s2">how the hell do scale it cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.049" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">storytelling monkeys and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.299" end="00:32:52.899" style="s2">we need recipes to help the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:55.179" style="s2">propagate so this good unless</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.899" end="00:32:57.220" style="s2">everybody&#39;s just Yoda is then why does</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.179" end="00:32:58.179" style="s2">it always break down mm-hmm why do why</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.220" end="00:33:01.230" style="s2">wait to meet when just go doesn&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.179" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">down one of the reasons is because as</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.230" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">our friend Lao Tzu discovered and by the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:09.880" style="s2">way also a friend Buddha discovered</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:11.710" style="s2">enter friend Jesus discovered every time</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.880" end="00:33:15.220" style="s2">the storytelling monkeys try to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.710" end="00:33:17.500" style="s2">a story to tell they it up so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.220" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">be mindful of that and recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.500" end="00:33:21.179" style="s2">the storytelling piece of it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:25.210" style="s2">isn&#39;t the answer</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.179" end="00:33:26.980" style="s2">okay so Sherlock Holmes style now carve</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.210" end="00:33:29.080" style="s2">that out of the available portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.980" end="00:33:30.370" style="s2">things that we can do how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.080" end="00:33:32.470" style="s2">doing anything at all that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.370" end="00:33:34.360" style="s2">involve being a storytelling monkey oK</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.470" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve got it we&#39;ve got an arrow problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.360" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s smaller it&#39;s a smaller space</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:41.529" style="s2">but you know so let&#39;s just think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:43.419" style="s2">if you know where we are culturally</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.529" end="00:33:46.270" style="s2">these days there&#39;s a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.419" end="00:33:49.480" style="s2">stumbling into these spaces via broad</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.270" end="00:33:51.190" style="s2">access to ecstatic technologies so</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.480" end="00:33:53.590" style="s2">whether that&#39;s transformational ffedith</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.190" end="00:33:55.860" style="s2">festivals or you know transformational</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.590" end="00:33:57.940" style="s2">technologies or whatever it is or</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.860" end="00:34:00.070" style="s2">psychopharmacology you know all these</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.940" end="00:34:03.100" style="s2">things people are bumbling into these</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.070" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">spaces on purpose or not they&#39;re getting</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.659" end="00:34:23.819" style="s2">they got there and then the moment</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.619" end="00:34:27.099" style="s2">they&#39;re no longer in that coherent field</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.819" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">we&#39;re back to trying to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.099" end="00:34:31.569" style="s2">in the prison-house of language telling</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.339" style="s2">stories and making analogies or</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.569" end="00:34:34.450" style="s2">metaphors so let&#39;s make a distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.339" end="00:34:38.349" style="s2">think with this distinction I think is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.450" end="00:34:42.789" style="s2">quite helpful there&#39;s at least two</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.349" end="00:34:43.770" style="s2">distinct uses of language this one over</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.789" end="00:34:49.389" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.770" end="00:34:52.480" style="s2">I&#39;ll call semantic reality mapping this</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.389" end="00:34:56.190" style="s2">is really good for things like building</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.480" end="00:34:59.619" style="s2">houses or putting together battle plans</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.190" end="00:35:02.819" style="s2">it Orient&#39;s coordinated behavior where</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.619" end="00:35:04.750" style="s2">the checksum of reality is pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.819" end="00:35:07.539" style="s2">science does a lot of this sciences</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.750" end="00:35:12.789" style="s2">pretty much this kind of thing over here</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.539" end="00:35:14.589" style="s2">is poetry parable where the fingers</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.789" end="00:35:17.819" style="s2">pointing to the moon and the point is</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.589" end="00:35:19.720" style="s2">the moon not the finger this we can use</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.819" end="00:35:21.640" style="s2">which is to be very careful that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.720" end="00:35:23.529" style="s2">not doing this so the problem that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.640" end="00:35:25.150" style="s2">think happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.529" end="00:35:26.859" style="s2">particular with the folks that wear lots</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.150" end="00:35:30.099" style="s2">of feathers and like to take too many</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.859" end="00:35:32.020" style="s2">drugs is they do this so they have an</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.099" end="00:35:33.430" style="s2">experience and then try to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.020" end="00:35:37.809" style="s2">science so pre-scripted versus</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.430" end="00:35:39.130" style="s2">descriptive both really they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.809" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">prescription and descriptions because</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.130" end="00:35:42.760" style="s2">poetry is not really description</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:46.839" style="s2">it&#39;s an octave figurative versus literal</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.760" end="00:35:48.910" style="s2">yes yeah so the trick is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.839" end="00:35:52.299" style="s2">actually be able to use language as some</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.910" end="00:35:55.420" style="s2">way of creating a a resonance frequency</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.299" end="00:35:57.369" style="s2">or protocol match that generates a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.420" end="00:36:02.980" style="s2">capacity for communication that is not</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.369" end="00:36:05.490" style="s2">itself specifically semantics which I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.980" end="00:36:08.049" style="s2">would propose both parable and poetry do</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.490" end="00:36:09.490" style="s2">it Orient&#39;s you in the direction of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.049" end="00:36:12.490" style="s2">feeling in yourself like think about</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.490" end="00:36:14.980" style="s2">poetry when you read a poem you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.490" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">understand the poem but something about</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.980" end="00:36:22.510" style="s2">the way that the poem coordinates</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:26.349" style="s2">language helps you weren&#39;t in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.510" end="00:36:29.710" style="s2">to an experience that feels like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.349" end="00:36:31.660" style="s2">feeling that the poet was also feeling</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.710" end="00:36:34.240" style="s2">so it creates a possibility there being</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.660" end="00:36:39.060" style="s2">a connection at the level of interior</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.240" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">feeling not a connection at the level of</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:50.260" style="s2">I mean it felt like you did have some</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:52.150" style="s2">future-forward practicality and</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.260" end="00:36:55.839" style="s2">application in your initial description</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.150" end="00:36:59.170" style="s2">you said it does well with novelty and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.839" end="00:37:00.730" style="s2">it&#39;s anti fragile and there&#39;s me as you</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.170" end="00:37:01.930" style="s2">thought of it feel like timeless</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.730" end="00:37:06.730" style="s2">qualities but it for sure feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.930" end="00:37:10.089" style="s2">important now and going forward and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.730" end="00:37:12.910" style="s2">I was wondering because if we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.089" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">the here&#39;s the instructions on how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.910" end="00:37:19.480" style="s2">get back here because then we&#39;ve named a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:23.260" style="s2">thing that&#39;s not the thing and emergent</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.480" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">coherence is kind of this weird slippery</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.260" end="00:37:29.560" style="s2">thing to pin down you have communities</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:31.420" style="s2">of practice like Quakers and others that</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.560" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">have spent centuries and even you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.420" end="00:37:37.660" style="s2">generations passing on that knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.240" end="00:37:41.070" style="s2">was just with some indigenous for DNA</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.660" end="00:37:45.490" style="s2">and Lakota folks right and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.070" end="00:37:47.580" style="s2">infinite tradition of we will talk until</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.490" end="00:37:51.609" style="s2">the thing that needed to get done</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.580" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">emerges but nor are we on the clock and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.609" end="00:38:00.849" style="s2">if this takes 10 minutes so be it if</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:38:04.570" style="s2">this takes 10 days so be it so is there</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.849" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">a version of this that is you know kind</p>

<p begin="00:41:36.890" end="00:41:40.429" style="s2">together this was your question around</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.419" end="00:41:42.229" style="s2">parallel and series right it&#39;s like both</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.429" end="00:41:44.150" style="s2">those everybody sense making can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.229" end="00:41:46.069" style="s2">heard and then choice making can factor</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.150" end="00:41:47.479" style="s2">everybody sense making but if I met</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.069" end="00:41:49.939" style="s2">thousands of people there&#39;s no way to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.479" end="00:41:51.979" style="s2">have everybody talk to even hear each</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.939" end="00:41:55.339" style="s2">other without some kind of technology -</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.979" end="00:41:57.529" style="s2">and so then tribes got bigger than that</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.339" end="00:42:00.259" style="s2">by certain kinds of evolutionary forcing</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.529" end="00:42:02.059" style="s2">functions by instituting things like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.259" end="00:42:04.279" style="s2">command and control hierarchy that</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.059" end="00:42:06.169" style="s2">controlled the communication flows where</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.279" end="00:42:07.549" style="s2">some people were doing choice making not</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.169" end="00:42:08.959" style="s2">informed by the sense making of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.549" end="00:42:10.699" style="s2">whole and now you get diminishing</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.959" end="00:42:12.769" style="s2">returns on collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.699" end="00:42:14.029" style="s2">that&#39;s in the only scaling methods we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.769" end="00:42:16.369" style="s2">had and that was that angry gods</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.029" end="00:42:17.599" style="s2">hypothesis thing that we were sure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.369" end="00:42:19.069" style="s2">there&#39;s many different technologies for</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.599" end="00:42:20.929" style="s2">maintaining that particular style of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.069" end="00:42:22.489" style="s2">collective intelligence which of course</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.929" end="00:42:25.249" style="s2">I could - is called game a like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.489" end="00:42:28.099" style="s2">whole way of solving that problem yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.249" end="00:42:30.890" style="s2">basically game a and scaling</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.099" end="00:42:33.049" style="s2">coordination or that are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.890" end="00:42:35.449" style="s2">synonymous scaling coordination beyond</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.049" end="00:42:37.849" style="s2">the Dunbar number huh meaning all the</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.849" end="00:42:43.189" style="s2">game a you would you would assert</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.309" end="00:42:45.349" style="s2">basically I kind of follow on for how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.189" end="00:42:49.789" style="s2">you how do you control and coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.349" end="00:42:54.469" style="s2">resources and humans beyond 100 250 yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.789" end="00:42:55.969" style="s2">yeah money formal hierarchy the notion</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.469" end="00:42:57.529" style="s2">of formality in general the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.969" end="00:43:00.169" style="s2">there&#39;s a role that somebody fills as</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.529" end="00:43:02.599" style="s2">opposed to humans are just humans and</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.169" end="00:43:04.069" style="s2">sometimes like diamond it from formal</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.599" end="00:43:06.490" style="s2">subordination to dynamic subordination</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.069" end="00:43:11.200" style="s2">that shift</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.490" end="00:43:12.670" style="s2">law policing each one of these are just</p>

<p begin="00:43:12.670" end="00:43:17.410" style="s2">all endeavoring to solve that problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.770" end="00:43:19.570" style="s2">shared in group identity like political</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.050" end="00:43:30.040" style="s2">context and so game a is basically rival</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.510" end="00:43:31.450" style="s2">risk game theory there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.040" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">stating it and sort of it has three</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.609" end="00:47:30.260" style="s2">answer is they wanted the christ we got</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.200" end="00:47:54.500" style="s2">answer is first slow way the down</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.010" end="00:47:57.310" style="s2">think developmental we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.500" end="00:48:00.290" style="s2">actually have to go all the way down to</p>

<p begin="00:48:00.290" end="00:48:08.210" style="s2">and only do that which is in fact</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.819" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">we are looking to migrate people into at</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:55:00.990" style="s2">however messily and imperfectly what are</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.160" end="00:55:03.420" style="s2">the liberating structures what are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.990" end="00:55:05.400" style="s2">rules to the infinite game right even if</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.420" end="00:55:08.789" style="s2">baked into the rules of the infinite</p>

<p begin="00:55:08.789" end="00:55:17.099" style="s2">can we do that so that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.710" end="00:55:20.309" style="s2">these glimpses of something more shared</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.099" end="00:55:23.130" style="s2">between us that continually seem to</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.309" end="00:55:24.809" style="s2">unspool and you know and here&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.130" end="00:55:27.269" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen I mean I think the key</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.809" end="00:55:29.700" style="s2">thing is to recognize that obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.269" end="00:55:34.009" style="s2">don&#39;t know how because otherwise we</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.700" end="00:55:37.109" style="s2">already would have and that&#39;s crucial</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.009" end="00:55:39.059" style="s2">it&#39;s important so it&#39;s worth continue to</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.109" end="00:55:40.109" style="s2">try which of course all of us know</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.059" end="00:55:42.359" style="s2">intuitively but I think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.109" end="00:55:43.559" style="s2">to keep putting it out there and my</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.359" end="00:55:46.440" style="s2">sense is at least my own personal</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.559" end="00:55:48.720" style="s2">experience is that it&#39;s becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.440" end="00:55:50.549" style="s2">clear like I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.720" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">wandering in the desert coming back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.549" end="00:55:53.730" style="s2">the same place now it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:54.930" style="s2">actually there is more and more clarity</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.730" end="00:56:00.000" style="s2">so I&#39;ll give you some examples of things</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.930" end="00:56:04.349" style="s2">that seem to be more right than wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.000" end="00:56:06.299" style="s2">one is let&#39;s just take think the concept</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.349" end="00:56:08.569" style="s2">of learning and what I want to do is I</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.299" end="00:56:11.099" style="s2">want to I want to shift and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.569" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">novel like this happens biscuits I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.099" end="00:56:14.309" style="s2">it&#39;s key is just to hold things in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:19.410" style="s2">right order the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.309" end="00:56:24.130" style="s2">teaching and cultivating Epiphany</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.410" end="00:56:29.050" style="s2">and so teaching is I give you a set of</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.130" end="00:56:33.790" style="s2">information I through any particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.050" end="00:56:34.990" style="s2">means generally rote endeavor to cause</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.790" end="00:56:36.700" style="s2">you to be able to repeat that</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.990" end="00:56:37.810" style="s2">information back to me and verify that</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.700" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve absorbed it in a way that has</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.810" end="00:56:42.010" style="s2">high fidelity so that is coding it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">software and I&#39;m creating some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.010" end="00:56:47.920" style="s2">software mapping in you in cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:51.130" style="s2">epiphany I try to find some how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.920" end="00:56:54.190" style="s2">actually generate in you the insight</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.130" end="00:56:57.790" style="s2">they gave rise to that being the thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.190" end="00:57:02.290" style="s2">in the first place all right so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.790" end="00:57:04.510" style="s2">even teach a man to fish but cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.290" end="00:57:08.290" style="s2">in a man the the capacity of becoming</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.510" end="00:57:11.790" style="s2">fisherman in himself that distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.290" end="00:57:11.790" style="s2">definitely one of the distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:18.420" style="s2">generator function more than output</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.710" end="00:57:22.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a way of putting it okay and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.420" end="00:57:25.990" style="s2">we can know I&#39;ve got some thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.990" end="00:57:27.550" style="s2">how to do that synthesis you said that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.990" end="00:57:28.750" style="s2">was one of the distinctions no I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.550" end="00:57:32.140" style="s2">this this useful thing of saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.750" end="00:57:33.850" style="s2">here&#39;s the here&#39;s the stuff I found yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.140" end="00:57:36.580" style="s2">and you know most of it has been a</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.850" end="00:57:37.270" style="s2">disaster but there&#39;s a few that actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.580" end="00:57:39.820" style="s2">kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.270" end="00:57:44.670" style="s2">so it&#39;s this let&#39;s see what else we got</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.820" end="00:57:47.110" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s a few we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.670" end="00:57:50.530" style="s2">coherence of difference rather than</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.110" end="00:57:54.730" style="s2">coherence of sameness like heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.530" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">coherence correct so when you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.730" end="00:57:58.450" style="s2">about the subordination of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">individual versus individuality there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.450" end="00:58:04.510" style="s2">something having to do with that there</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:06.370" style="s2">is a meaningfulness and a beauty and a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.510" end="00:58:08.700" style="s2">dignity of the individual that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.370" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">want to subordinate in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.700" end="00:58:12.940" style="s2">homogenizing way we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:14.710" style="s2">decrease the diversity that leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.940" end="00:58:17.830" style="s2">resilience of life right and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.710" end="00:58:20.740" style="s2">richness of it am i own discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.830" end="00:58:22.360" style="s2">choice making even as i&#39;m part of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.740" end="00:58:27.220" style="s2">collective that feels really important</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.360" end="00:58:29.320" style="s2">right and then simultaneously there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.220" end="00:58:31.400" style="s2">kinds of diversity and difference that</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.320" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">only lead to</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.400" end="00:58:36.419" style="s2">unreconciled bol entropic conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:39.630" style="s2">so those are not interesting kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.419" end="00:58:41.969" style="s2">diversity and so we want as much</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.630" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">diversity as we can create synergy</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.969" end="00:58:48.509" style="s2">across we get maximum synergy from</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">maximum diversity with maximum parallax</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.509" end="00:58:53.519" style="s2">so now think about for a moment with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:55.829" style="s2">idea of parallax and just just define</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.519" end="00:58:59.369" style="s2">that if it was like so parallax in terms</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.829" end="00:59:01.529" style="s2">of the way the two eyes neither eye has</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.369" end="00:59:04.619" style="s2">depth perception or peripheral vision</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.529" end="00:59:07.589" style="s2">right and when I have both eyes together</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.619" end="00:59:08.789" style="s2">they they have a lot of shared things</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.589" end="00:59:10.229" style="s2">that they see but because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.789" end="00:59:11.969" style="s2">different locations they also have</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.229" end="00:59:13.949" style="s2">slightly different things that they see</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.969" end="00:59:15.900" style="s2">so there&#39;s overlap a difference right</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.949" end="00:59:17.669" style="s2">and this is important so when I put the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.900" end="00:59:18.630" style="s2">two together they&#39;re not competing for</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.669" end="00:59:21.869" style="s2">which one is right that would be</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.630" end="00:59:23.519" style="s2">ridiculous right they&#39;re actually the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.869" end="00:59:25.109" style="s2">optical cortex is putting the</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.519" end="00:59:26.609" style="s2">information together in a way where if</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.109" end="00:59:28.019" style="s2">there&#39;s actually an error in this one</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.609" end="00:59:30.319" style="s2">its corrected by what this one is doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.019" end="00:59:33.599" style="s2">so they error correct each other and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.319" end="00:59:35.609" style="s2">then because I can compute the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:38.339" style="s2">hypotenuse of the triangle I actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.609" end="00:59:40.469" style="s2">get depth perception and periphery so</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.339" end="00:59:42.359" style="s2">the two eyes together give things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.469" end="00:59:45.179" style="s2">neither of them did separately plus err</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.359" end="00:59:46.650" style="s2">correction so I want them to have some</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.179" end="00:59:47.939" style="s2">shared reality and I want them to find</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.650" end="00:59:49.259" style="s2">their shared reality but I also want</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.939" end="00:59:51.779" style="s2">them to have difference and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.259" end="00:59:53.749" style="s2">them to relate in a deep way and then I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.779" end="00:59:56.279" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t want my ears to be more eyes</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.749" end="00:59:57.779" style="s2">right like there&#39;s a deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.279" end="00:59:59.429" style="s2">parallax between ears and eyes where</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.779" end="01:00:00.959" style="s2">eyes are giving me location of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.429" end="01:00:02.400" style="s2">and ears are giving me a different kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.959" end="01:00:04.589" style="s2">of location things so the ears with each</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.400" end="01:00:05.969" style="s2">other give me echolocation and the ears</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.589" end="01:00:07.380" style="s2">and the eyes together give me a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.969" end="01:00:11.279" style="s2">different kind of sense making in</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.380" end="01:00:14.429" style="s2">3-space so we are mr. Potato Head so if</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.279" end="01:00:16.109" style="s2">you think about like every imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.429" end="01:00:17.729" style="s2">the ears and eyes were just fighting</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.109" end="01:00:19.829" style="s2">over which was right and the other one</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.729" end="01:00:21.029" style="s2">was one was comprehensively right in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.829" end="01:00:22.409" style="s2">complete description of reality and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.029" end="01:00:23.669" style="s2">other was comprehensively wrong that</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.409" end="01:00:26.069" style="s2">would be ridiculous we would dissolve</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.669" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">into gibberish right there is a place</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.069" end="01:00:30.359" style="s2">where they all have accurate information</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:31.979" style="s2">about reality and it&#39;s all partial this</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.359" end="01:00:34.019" style="s2">speaks to them that initiatives like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.979" end="01:00:35.579" style="s2">third that you mentioned so in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.019" end="01:00:39.029" style="s2">context when the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.579" end="01:00:41.459" style="s2">the eyes and the ears there&#39;s a third we</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.029" end="01:00:43.469" style="s2">know that sir that&#39;s our experience our</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.459" end="01:00:44.190" style="s2">open though yeah right so then the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.469" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">question is okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.190" end="01:00:51.810" style="s2">eub eyes all the years where&#39;s our third</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:52.890" style="s2">but it didn&#39;t meet about that is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.810" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">then you get some very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.890" end="01:00:57.890" style="s2">things where on the one hand you have</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.339" end="01:01:07.260" style="s2">both of us actually have a clear</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.250" end="01:01:13.740" style="s2">awareness in ourselves that we are here</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.260" end="01:01:19.470" style="s2">to with fidelity report what we perceive</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.740" end="01:01:24.109" style="s2">of reality we are deeply cognizant of</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.470" end="01:01:27.170" style="s2">the fact that that is not reality mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.109" end="01:01:32.040" style="s2">we are deeply caught in to the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.170" end="01:01:34.710" style="s2">the other is here to report reality and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.040" end="01:01:37.140" style="s2">that somehow there is something that can</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.710" end="01:01:39.540" style="s2">happen that gives a deeper grasp of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.140" end="01:01:41.790" style="s2">reality and the reason when I&#39;m zooming</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.540" end="01:01:45.240" style="s2">in on that is that it actually a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.790" end="01:01:48.900" style="s2">the characteristics of this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.240" end="01:01:52.349" style="s2">place have to do with a a way to fully</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.900" end="01:01:55.200" style="s2">and deeply honor like all the you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.349" end="01:01:59.910" style="s2">know without the least bit of attachment</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.200" end="01:02:01.859" style="s2">to any of it and that&#39;s key you have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.910" end="01:02:03.900" style="s2">actually we&#39;re not in the it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.859" end="01:02:06.780" style="s2">pries the trans so we actually want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.900" end="01:02:08.520" style="s2">know lots of stuff I want to have really</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.780" end="01:02:09.869" style="s2">amazing frameworks we want to have a lot</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.520" end="01:02:12.150" style="s2">of life experience when to bring that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.869" end="01:02:13.950" style="s2">all the way in but then we also didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.150" end="01:02:16.589" style="s2">want to have complete non attachment to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.950" end="01:02:19.710" style="s2">any of it and be able to code of create</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.589" end="01:02:21.810" style="s2">a bespoke since synthetic language in</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.710" end="01:02:23.579" style="s2">real time if necessary ok so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.810" end="01:02:25.800" style="s2">of interesting I mean I loved all that</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.579" end="01:02:27.930" style="s2">ok so I want to add something to this</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.800" end="01:02:29.970" style="s2">because this is actually like this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.930" end="01:02:32.280" style="s2">really exciting to me so I&#39;ve got lots</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.970" end="01:02:34.200" style="s2">of senses right and they&#39;re all taking</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.280" end="01:02:35.700" style="s2">in some true information they can all</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.200" end="01:02:38.700" style="s2">have error and they&#39;re all partial</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.700" end="01:02:41.460" style="s2">I also have lots of actuator I can move</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.700" end="01:02:43.829" style="s2">lots of different muscles and of course</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.460" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">the the leg doesn&#39;t want the to compete</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.829" end="01:02:48.060" style="s2">with the arm for which one gets to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:49.500" style="s2">the actuator it actually wants to not</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.060" end="01:02:52.109" style="s2">just coordinate but to be in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.500" end="01:02:53.730" style="s2">coherence right and so I&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.109" end="01:02:56.339" style="s2">sensory stuff I got lots of actuator</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.730" end="01:02:58.170" style="s2">stuff why is it that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.339" end="01:03:00.230" style="s2">random splotches of coal</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.170" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">in sound but it comes together into a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.230" end="01:03:04.440" style="s2">coherence of self and world and self in</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:07.049" style="s2">relationship with world as a coherence</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.440" end="01:03:09.299" style="s2">phenomena so how all the sensing comes</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.049" end="01:03:10.740" style="s2">together inside of me is a coherence</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.299" end="01:03:12.690" style="s2">villain that&#39;s the binding problem in</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.740" end="01:03:14.910" style="s2">neuroscience rain and in the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.690" end="01:03:17.069" style="s2">of mind and then the actuator why am I</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.910" end="01:03:18.690" style="s2">not how do all those parts work together</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.069" end="01:03:20.940" style="s2">so well as a coherence phenomenon so if</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.690" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">we think about that every human on their</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.940" end="01:03:27.390" style="s2">own the next level up is sensing making</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:31.710" style="s2">sense and actuated but then when we come</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.390" end="01:03:35.010" style="s2">together like I want you sensing stuff</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.710" end="01:03:37.109" style="s2">differently than I am and I trust that</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.010" end="01:03:40.920" style="s2">there is information in that that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.109" end="01:03:42.510" style="s2">actually really want to have access to</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.920" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">myself and I want the collective to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.510" end="01:03:46.440" style="s2">and I want you actuated differently than</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">I am but I really want to come into</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.440" end="01:03:53.400" style="s2">coherence so in almost fact I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.750" style="s2">wasn&#39;t kind of like that the joke about</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.400" end="01:03:58.380" style="s2">mr. Potato Head is actually kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.750" end="01:04:00.319" style="s2">who is the third right if we personify</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.380" end="01:04:03.210" style="s2">and your sounds like so we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.319" end="01:04:04.559" style="s2">different organs bringing different</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.210" end="01:04:07.170" style="s2">perspectives when we come together we</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.559" end="01:04:09.059" style="s2">get dimensionality right we get a</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.170" end="01:04:12.509" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a colocation of binocular</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.059" end="01:04:16.140" style="s2">vision we get more out of aggregating</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.509" end="01:04:17.990" style="s2">and integrating our realities and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.140" end="01:04:19.859" style="s2">then becomes as you said not just</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.990" end="01:04:23.430" style="s2">fragmented data feeds it becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.859" end="01:04:28.470" style="s2">Gestalt boom though it becomes a reality</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.430" end="01:04:30.089" style="s2">for some super a sensible version of us</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.470" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">that is greater than the sum of its</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.089" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">parts</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.299" end="01:04:35.299" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.280" end="01:04:44.990" style="s2">so you said initial conditions good with</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.380" end="01:04:47.569" style="s2">novelty and Auntie fragile but what and</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.990" end="01:04:49.069" style="s2">then you also said hey the mine that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.569" end="01:04:50.690" style="s2">running like you take the societal</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.069" end="01:04:52.490" style="s2">structure off but the mind the mind that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.690" end="01:04:54.950" style="s2">was formatted to support this assisted</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.490" end="01:04:56.780" style="s2">social structure persists even if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.950" end="01:04:59.000" style="s2">have this experience it&#39;s gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.780" end="01:05:01.700" style="s2">looped back through old fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.000" end="01:05:05.690" style="s2">gamei habits and patterns which sounds</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.700" end="01:05:08.780" style="s2">super fragile this right like</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.690" end="01:05:11.359" style="s2">like right now coherence is highly</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.780" end="01:05:13.609" style="s2">highly fragile yes and yet you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.359" end="01:05:15.500" style="s2">saying it either has an inherent</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.609" end="01:05:18.559" style="s2">property or maybe you just hope that it</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.500" end="01:05:20.599" style="s2">would be ultimately eventually anti</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.559" end="01:05:22.010" style="s2">fragile can we pull that app up because</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.599" end="01:05:24.589" style="s2">I think I wouldn&#39;t be having this</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.010" end="01:05:26.900" style="s2">conversation if it was a done deal</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.589" end="01:05:28.700" style="s2">or if the first time people glimpsed it</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.900" end="01:05:31.339" style="s2">were like got it let&#39;s go rock</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.700" end="01:05:34.280" style="s2">with this this is actually wildly</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.339" end="01:05:37.220" style="s2">delicate right now yeah I think this if</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.280" end="01:05:39.109" style="s2">you if you hold in your mind the example</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.220" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">the game of game this happens of you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.109" end="01:05:44.420" style="s2">like the best current example of</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:46.790" style="s2">coherence and it really is like in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.420" end="01:05:49.819" style="s2">entire universe as far as we know it by</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.790" end="01:05:52.730" style="s2">the best actual example of coherence and</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.819" end="01:05:55.369" style="s2">then we say okay well if we do the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.730" end="01:05:57.140" style="s2">anthropology and we take a look back and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.369" end="01:06:02.030" style="s2">say oh how long did it take to pull that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.140" end="01:06:03.920" style="s2"> together finding the remember I had</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.030" end="01:06:07.970" style="s2">that spot in possibility space so</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.920" end="01:06:09.950" style="s2">imagine a cube and in that cube let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.970" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">make the cube 1 million by 1 million by</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.950" end="01:06:16.099" style="s2">1 million so it&#39;s a big cube ok and all</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:19.339" style="s2">over there are different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.099" end="01:06:22.099" style="s2">phenotypes hominids happened to be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.339" end="01:06:24.770" style="s2">sphere about a thousand by a thousand by</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.099" end="01:06:28.910" style="s2">thousand in that cute mollusks are down</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.770" end="01:06:31.609" style="s2">here inside the sphere of hominid</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.910" end="01:06:35.059" style="s2">there&#39;s an even smaller sphere which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.609" end="01:06:37.460" style="s2">homo sapiens which is maybe five by five</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.059" end="01:06:40.010" style="s2">by five in terms of the possibility</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.460" end="01:06:41.660" style="s2">space and you&#39;re talking sentient</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.010" end="01:06:44.359" style="s2">biomass what&#39;s your what&#39;s your million</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.660" end="01:06:45.920" style="s2">cube my cube is the well it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.359" end="01:06:47.210" style="s2">an n-dimensional space but I&#39;m reducing</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.920" end="01:06:48.950" style="s2">it to three to make it work so don&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.210" end="01:06:50.329" style="s2">indexes on otherwise it&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.950" end="01:06:53.150" style="s2">talk down the metaphor exam and isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.329" end="01:06:56.119" style="s2">exam doesn&#39;t does it hold it so the how</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.150" end="01:06:58.339" style="s2">do you find in the totality of all the</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.119" end="01:07:00.130" style="s2">things that are going on a particular</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.339" end="01:07:04.040" style="s2">complex that hangs together two</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.130" end="01:07:05.720" style="s2">particular homeostatic autocatalytic</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.040" end="01:07:07.150" style="s2">phenomenon that has the thing and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.720" end="01:07:11.030" style="s2">necessary for it to actually hold</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.150" end="01:07:12.740" style="s2">coherently right so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.030" end="01:07:15.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different exploration</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.740" end="01:07:18.530" style="s2">around this little place just think of</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.560" end="01:07:21.440" style="s2">it as a place if you&#39;re not of sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.530" end="01:07:22.849" style="s2">right so in hominid you got primate and</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.440" end="01:07:25.160" style="s2">you got hominid and you smaller and</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.849" end="01:07:26.660" style="s2">smaller in problem in hominid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.160" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">all these foof explorations of okay how</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.660" end="01:07:31.040" style="s2">does this thing what were the different</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">ways to play in this hominid game and as</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.040" end="01:07:35.780" style="s2">you kind of get closer to the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:37.700" style="s2">location of Homo sapiens you got you</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.780" end="01:07:41.180" style="s2">know homo erectus right and you got I</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.700" end="01:07:42.890" style="s2">will bear against us there&#39;s a some</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.180" end="01:07:44.450" style="s2">things come together but it takes like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.890" end="01:07:47.240" style="s2">million and a half years to actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.450" end="01:07:48.589" style="s2">land on Boop there&#39;s the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.240" end="01:07:50.960" style="s2">actually has all the different elements</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.589" end="01:07:52.430" style="s2">together by the way meta contextual it</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.960" end="01:07:54.859" style="s2">has not just the physiological</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.430" end="01:07:57.500" style="s2">capacities but it also has grand mothers</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.859" end="01:08:00.349" style="s2">and fathers who can actually support the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.500" end="01:08:01.910" style="s2">neoteny authentic necessity for this</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.349" end="01:08:03.859" style="s2">plus sista to be able to actually emerge</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.910" end="01:08:05.329" style="s2">with culture so there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.859" end="01:08:07.430" style="s2">that&#39;s been put together through</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.329" end="01:08:09.319" style="s2">evolutionary process it&#39;s exploring the</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.430" end="01:08:12.050" style="s2">space of possibility and as it kind of</p>

<p begin="01:08:12.050" end="01:08:15.079" style="s2">of possibility until it orbits around</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.310" end="01:08:17.120" style="s2">that spot all right now if you take that</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.079" end="01:08:19.670" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at something which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.120" end="01:08:22.460" style="s2">inside that homo sapiens sapiens spot</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.670" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">and I might hypothesize by the way has</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.460" end="01:08:26.239" style="s2">been there the whole time which just</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:28.730" style="s2">finds a meta arc coming here but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.239" end="01:08:31.009" style="s2">not gonna go into T ha T ology that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.730" end="01:08:35.540" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s one by one it&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.009" end="01:08:36.920" style="s2">territory but we can notice when so</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.540" end="01:08:38.690" style="s2">first we can use that as an example of</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.920" end="01:08:39.830" style="s2">saying okay this is how hard it is so</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.690" end="01:08:41.779" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna kind of vector in that</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.830" end="01:08:43.640" style="s2">direction and what kind of like Buddhism</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.779" end="01:08:44.900" style="s2">will emerge and kind of move the game</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.640" end="01:08:46.700" style="s2">forward a little bit will kind of learn</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.900" end="01:08:48.410" style="s2">some interesting stuff and then collapse</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.700" end="01:08:50.450" style="s2">them Christianity will happen and look</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.410" end="01:08:51.830" style="s2">at him do its thing and a big level up</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.450" end="01:08:53.330" style="s2">occurs and the general sort of state of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.830" end="01:08:55.310" style="s2">Homo sapiens but we don&#39;t quite get</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.330" end="01:08:57.290" style="s2">there so now at this point we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.310" end="01:08:59.450" style="s2">all right given everything we know and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.290" end="01:09:01.549" style="s2">given the timeframe that we think we may</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.450" end="01:09:02.420" style="s2">have actually to pull this off what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.549" end="01:09:04.790" style="s2">the process by</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.420" end="01:09:07.670" style="s2">we explore it and of course again the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.790" end="01:09:09.259" style="s2">point that I&#39;m sending is to degree to</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.670" end="01:09:11.420" style="s2">which as an individual you can put</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.259" end="01:09:14.350" style="s2">yourself inside the sphere that defines</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.420" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">this location you can get there</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.350" end="01:09:21.799" style="s2">then in that place can you bring other</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:24.949" style="s2">people into that place and in that place</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.799" end="01:09:28.190" style="s2">just that group what can happen there</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.949" end="01:09:30.679" style="s2">and this then the conception metaphor so</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.190" end="01:09:32.179" style="s2">now we&#39;re moving from the long term arc</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.679" end="01:09:33.710" style="s2">at the species level is just took at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.179" end="01:09:39.679" style="s2">long term ARP at the individual level</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.710" end="01:09:41.929" style="s2">the fertilized egg is fragile in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.679" end="01:09:44.210" style="s2">context of once it goes to his</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.929" end="01:09:50.029" style="s2">developmental arc extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.210" end="01:09:52.549" style="s2">resilient being an adult human is kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.029" end="01:09:53.779" style="s2">of a kick-ass animal really really good</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.549" end="01:09:55.190" style="s2">at being animal but of course the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.779" end="01:09:55.850" style="s2">fertilized egg is still extremely</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.190" end="01:09:57.830" style="s2">fragile</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.850" end="01:10:00.080" style="s2">so the question we might ask is like</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.830" end="01:10:01.310" style="s2">well what&#39;s our womb well I&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.080" end="01:10:05.920" style="s2">push back on that I&#39;d say a</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.310" end="01:10:08.810" style="s2">adult human this is a is a weak naked</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.920" end="01:10:10.760" style="s2">kick by everybody but with culture with</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.810" end="01:10:13.940" style="s2">the instruction manual he&#39;s badass I</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.760" end="01:10:16.940" style="s2">actually disagree I would point out that</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.940" end="01:10:19.730" style="s2">the the things that just basic humans</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.940" end="01:10:21.110" style="s2">can do like the Roche it accurately are</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.730" end="01:10:23.030" style="s2">actually rather astounding in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.110" end="01:10:25.100" style="s2">context of the animal kingdom and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.030" end="01:10:26.750" style="s2">plasticity of the design parameters with</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.100" end="01:10:29.840" style="s2">human body can actually be trained to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.750" end="01:10:32.210" style="s2">that is not coded in the instinct of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.840" end="01:10:34.100" style="s2">given animal is as impressive as the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.210" end="01:10:37.969" style="s2">flexibility at the level of IDS base</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.100" end="01:10:39.650" style="s2">that there is no Baryshnikov in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.969" end="01:10:41.570" style="s2">animal kingdom and to the egregious</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.650" end="01:10:43.010" style="s2">there is diversion to carve that animal</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.570" end="01:10:44.750" style="s2">cannot also then become an Aretha</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.010" end="01:10:47.210" style="s2">Franklin I think that&#39;s actually pretty</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.750" end="01:10:49.239" style="s2"> intense how much plasticity in</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.210" end="01:10:51.949" style="s2">design parameters in this particular</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.239" end="01:10:54.620" style="s2">physical body then of course you layer</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.949" end="01:10:56.300" style="s2">that plug that actuation capacity the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.620" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">plasticity of actuation capacity in with</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.300" end="01:11:01.880" style="s2">the plasticity of perception and</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:06.650" style="s2">ideation obviously that thing is got</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.880" end="01:11:08.630" style="s2">well you get to to the moon and back but</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.650" end="01:11:09.949" style="s2">I think the the the proposition that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.630" end="01:11:12.530" style="s2">think you&#39;re hitting on I think the key</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.949" end="01:11:13.639" style="s2">question is recognizing that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.530" end="01:11:15.800" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.639" end="01:11:18.469" style="s2">or the necessary incision conditions of</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.800" end="01:11:21.619" style="s2">coherence that I was describing is very</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.469" end="01:11:24.110" style="s2">much the adult form the mature form and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.619" end="01:11:25.820" style="s2">so it is very much the case in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.110" end="01:11:28.280" style="s2">experience the coherence as it currently</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.820" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">is able to manifest I were actually able</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.280" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">to establish it is extremely fragile and</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.139" end="01:11:39.380" style="s2">quite difficult to hold together even in</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.909" end="01:11:41.659" style="s2">just ordinary conditions much less than</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.380" end="01:11:44.150" style="s2">quite challenging conditions so the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.659" end="01:11:46.659" style="s2">question of scaling it is a question</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.150" end="01:11:53.090" style="s2">actually of how do we simultaneously</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.659" end="01:11:55.580" style="s2">increase its let&#39;s call it strength its</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.090" end="01:11:58.909" style="s2">capacity to maintain coherence under a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.580" end="01:12:00.920" style="s2">wide variety of different conditions its</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.909" end="01:12:03.949" style="s2">scope the degree to which it can</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.920" end="01:12:06.469" style="s2">actually bring in more people and its</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.949" end="01:12:11.540" style="s2">depth the degree to which it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.469" end="01:12:12.860" style="s2">able to fully realize the synergy value</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.540" end="01:12:14.199" style="s2">of those people like instead of like a</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.860" end="01:12:17.360" style="s2">narrowband</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.199" end="01:12:18.710" style="s2">broadband so the question of how do we</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.360" end="01:12:23.810" style="s2">scale coherence I think is all three of</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.710" end="01:12:24.889" style="s2">those simultaneously if you would if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.810" end="01:12:26.119" style="s2">mind if we can go back to that</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.889" end="01:12:30.199" style="s2">initiative like the little things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.119" end="01:12:34.969" style="s2">seemed to be seem to be true one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.199" end="01:12:40.159" style="s2">other ones that I&#39;ve found is that most</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.969" end="01:12:43.880" style="s2">of the failures to show up seem to</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.159" end="01:12:49.090" style="s2">actually fail for relatively simple</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.880" end="01:12:49.090" style="s2">reasons having to do with</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.239" end="01:13:01.480" style="s2">either the particularity zuv how human</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.380" end="01:13:05.080" style="s2">development in world delivers certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.480" end="01:13:07.180" style="s2">kinds of trauma or the particularity of</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.080" end="01:13:09.400" style="s2">how the coming to being of Homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.180" end="01:13:13.239" style="s2">delivered what you might call a species</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.400" end="01:13:14.380" style="s2">level trauma so either people who are</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.239" end="01:13:15.940" style="s2">entering into coherence enter into</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.380" end="01:13:17.320" style="s2">relations of codependency where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.940" end="01:13:18.969" style="s2">talked about you know the victim mindset</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.320" end="01:13:21.190" style="s2">and the savior mindset like these are</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.969" end="01:13:24.580" style="s2">all habitual responses that are either</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.190" end="01:13:27.100" style="s2">hard-coded into homo hard coded in what</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.580" end="01:13:31.900" style="s2">humaneness is at the at the more sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.100" end="01:13:33.850" style="s2">a primal level or because we are human</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.900" end="01:13:35.880" style="s2">beings who universally have been</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.850" end="01:13:38.770" style="s2">developed in the context of society</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.880" end="01:13:40.719" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed an enormous large number</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.770" end="01:13:43.750" style="s2">of blind spots bad habits and traumas as</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.719" end="01:13:47.440" style="s2">a consequence of that so sort of step</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.750" end="01:13:49.180" style="s2">one of these sort of you know things</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.440" end="01:13:50.050" style="s2">that seem to work is you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.180" end="01:13:51.640" style="s2">actually have gone through all the work</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.050" end="01:13:55.540" style="s2">of actually at the very least resolving</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.640" end="01:13:56.739" style="s2">yourself out of the trauma of society to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.540" end="01:14:00.160" style="s2">the extent that you know to pretty high</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.739" end="01:14:04.600" style="s2">extent to be perfectly honest and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.160" end="01:14:10.870" style="s2">having a capacity of being conscious of</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.600" end="01:14:12.460" style="s2">how biological instincts and habits that</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.870" end="01:14:14.440" style="s2">are hardwired below the developmental</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.460" end="01:14:16.510" style="s2">level are going to show up in</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.440" end="01:14:18.370" style="s2">relationship so being able to go through</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.510" end="01:14:22.600" style="s2">that level of training and there seems</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.370" end="01:14:25.150" style="s2">to be a kind of a minimum of those two</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.600" end="01:14:27.910" style="s2">that Pete any one has to be some level</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.150" end="01:14:29.590" style="s2">of development along both those kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.910" end="01:14:35.050" style="s2">work to be able to intern in coherence</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.590" end="01:14:37.890" style="s2">at all yeah and so because now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.050" end="01:14:40.239" style="s2">dealing obviously there are no folks</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.890" end="01:14:42.610" style="s2">comfortably camping out in a happy game</p>

<p begin="01:15:13.380" end="01:15:19.500" style="s2">so and even in an instant specifically</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.300" end="01:15:22.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve even come across a community</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.500" end="01:15:24.150" style="s2">that&#39;s dedicated to working on all those</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.680" end="01:15:25.440" style="s2">traumas and back there&#39;s there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.150" end="01:15:28.410" style="s2">few there&#39;s quite a few that are you</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.440" end="01:15:30.360" style="s2">know engaging in their access point to</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.410" end="01:15:33.030" style="s2">communitas is through helping people</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.360" end="01:15:34.740" style="s2">better engage experience catharsis right</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.030" end="01:15:36.900" style="s2">and then you get this ecstatic moment of</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.740" end="01:15:38.490" style="s2">like holy we&#39;re healed we&#39;re whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.900" end="01:15:42.510" style="s2">we&#39;re connected isn&#39;t this beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.490" end="01:15:44.430" style="s2">amazing and then it on spools right</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.510" end="01:15:46.920" style="s2">there and the question is like well wait</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.430" end="01:15:48.690" style="s2">is it just we need to do more of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.920" end="01:15:50.580" style="s2">thing that these guys are already doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.690" end="01:15:52.110" style="s2">they were partial or they weren&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.580" end="01:15:55.980" style="s2">there yet and do we get into some</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.110" end="01:15:57.750" style="s2">puritanical increasingly high buff or</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.980" end="01:16:00.240" style="s2">who gets to play at the coherence game</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.750" end="01:16:03.110" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re bringing your</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.240" end="01:16:05.640" style="s2">dirty shoes into our pure petri dish</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.110" end="01:16:07.500" style="s2">like how do we actually help the</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.640" end="01:16:09.540" style="s2">transitional generations generations</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.500" end="01:16:12.750" style="s2">well I think you already said that key</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.540" end="01:16:13.260" style="s2">piece so one is humility the other is</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.750" end="01:16:15.060" style="s2">patience</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.260" end="01:16:18.320" style="s2">I think one of the problems that tends</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.060" end="01:16:22.560" style="s2">to happen is there&#39;s a real significant</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.320" end="01:16:24.030" style="s2">meaningful breakthrough which then takes</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.560" end="01:16:26.660" style="s2">itself up set as having been to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.030" end="01:16:29.730" style="s2">breakthrough oh we did it</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.660" end="01:16:31.770" style="s2">awesome we&#39;re there right as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.730" end="01:16:34.950" style="s2">a okay this is probably a three to five</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.770" end="01:16:37.460" style="s2">maybe six generation process so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.950" end="01:16:40.260" style="s2">more like this this less like this</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.460" end="01:16:43.080" style="s2">movement and directionality with just</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.260" end="01:16:44.870" style="s2">any incomprehensible level of constantly</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.080" end="01:16:48.600" style="s2">going into humility and recognizing that</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.870" end="01:16:52.740" style="s2">no matter how much seems to have been</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.600" end="01:16:58.130" style="s2">done we may only be eight percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.740" end="01:16:58.130" style="s2">way there and so that&#39;s a lot left and</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.090" end="01:17:03.300" style="s2">some since that&#39;s that but you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.530" end="01:17:05.640" style="s2">always get you can get closer and and if</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.300" end="01:17:06.660" style="s2">when you are closer this is crucial</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.640" end="01:17:09.090" style="s2">right being able to distinguish the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.660" end="01:17:12.360" style="s2">difference between when you are more</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.090" end="01:17:14.100" style="s2">towards that and less and then being</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.360" end="01:17:16.740" style="s2">able to notice that the choices that are</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.100" end="01:17:18.420" style="s2">coming from more towards that are the</p>

<p begin="01:17:18.420" end="01:17:20.750" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.280" end="01:17:22.870" style="s2">and the choices that are coming from</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.750" end="01:17:25.520" style="s2">less from that of the word should be</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.870" end="01:17:28.430" style="s2">trailing and fading so you actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:30.260" style="s2">become a vector and so that then you</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.430" end="01:17:32.930" style="s2">become better and better at using that</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.260" end="01:17:35.630" style="s2">sense of more like this that&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.930" end="01:17:37.070" style="s2">in more and more of your choices you</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.630" end="01:17:38.840" style="s2">actually begin to get a very nice</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.070" end="01:17:43.580" style="s2">progressive movement in that container</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.840" end="01:17:47.570" style="s2">of humility and patience with enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.580" end="01:17:49.850" style="s2">runway and enough tolerance for creative</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.570" end="01:17:50.660" style="s2">destruction because you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.850" end="01:17:52.340" style="s2">you&#39;d run away</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.660" end="01:17:53.960" style="s2">well time that you could you talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.340" end="01:17:55.640" style="s2">about like hey humans are amazing and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.960" end="01:17:57.170" style="s2">check us out we can figure out living in</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.640" end="01:17:59.690" style="s2">the Arctic in the deserts well not</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.170" end="01:18:01.520" style="s2">really you drop any single naked monkey</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.690" end="01:18:03.950" style="s2">in either of those places they&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.520" end="01:18:06.800" style="s2">in 72 hours but right right but but</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.950" end="01:18:09.380" style="s2">enough clothes but no cigars and some</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.800" end="01:18:11.000" style="s2">lucky bastard finally figures it out and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.380" end="01:18:12.140" style="s2">then that gets encoded in culture and</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.000" end="01:18:14.180" style="s2">then not everybody has to die and</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.140" end="01:18:17.060" style="s2">suddenly we&#39;re a desert tribe or where</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.180" end="01:18:20.540" style="s2">did the Inuit right so so how do we do</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.060" end="01:18:23.480" style="s2">this if right there&#39;s both fragility and</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.540" end="01:18:26.960" style="s2">not in definite time I am reminded of</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.480" end="01:18:29.270" style="s2">the movie the Martian what I notice is</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.960" end="01:18:32.030" style="s2">that there&#39;s a another trap two traps</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.270" end="01:18:34.910" style="s2">actually one trap is the trap of urgency</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.030" end="01:18:37.280" style="s2">and here the trap is the trap of like</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.910" end="01:18:39.140" style="s2">perceived a responsibility when you say</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.280" end="01:18:41.420" style="s2">it&#39;s a trap of urgency meaning the</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.140" end="01:18:43.940" style="s2">perception and then the acting as if or</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.420" end="01:18:45.770" style="s2">do you mean the actual the perception of</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.940" end="01:18:48.350" style="s2">the acting as if which is in fact fully</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.770" end="01:18:53.000" style="s2">accurate fully accurate perception and</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.350" end="01:18:55.610" style="s2">the acting as if is a trap right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.000" end="01:18:58.340" style="s2">the it&#39;s the notion of you know James</p>

<p begin="01:18:58.340" end="01:19:03.560" style="s2">ticking he has to actually be acting his</p>

<p begin="01:19:05.780" end="01:19:12.260" style="s2">even the least bit of feeling and</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.130" end="01:19:13.790" style="s2">urgency guarantees failure it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:19:13.790" end="01:19:16.610" style="s2">exactly so that&#39;s another key right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.440" end="01:19:18.560" style="s2">this happens all the time as you get it</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.610" end="01:19:20.720" style="s2">now you can see it happen I&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.560" end="01:19:23.300" style="s2">happen many times in myself or there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.720" end="01:19:25.300" style="s2">recognition of the urgency which leads</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.300" end="01:19:28.550" style="s2">to a certain hardening and a certain</p>

<p begin="01:19:28.550" end="01:19:32.870" style="s2">either things that are not yet actually</p>

<p begin="01:19:32.870" end="01:19:41.230" style="s2">or rationalizing pulling from the game a</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.890" end="01:19:45.620" style="s2">toolkit oh that&#39;s a doozy you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.230" end="01:19:48.620" style="s2">okay that speaks very much to what you</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.620" end="01:19:51.860" style="s2">are saying in terms of people falling</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.620" end="01:19:54.140" style="s2">out of their state and we could talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.860" end="01:19:55.670" style="s2">about what a stage development take from</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.140" end="01:19:57.830" style="s2">a state experience but we could also</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.670" end="01:19:59.630" style="s2">talk about what are the sources of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.830" end="01:20:01.250" style="s2">fragility if we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.630" end="01:20:02.720" style="s2">antifragility we should understand the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.250" end="01:20:05.890" style="s2">sources of fragility and what we can do</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.720" end="01:20:09.560" style="s2">with those and so some simple constructs</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.890" end="01:20:12.740" style="s2">if we&#39;re endeavoring to create some kind</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.560" end="01:20:14.660" style="s2">of coherence we could have that break</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.740" end="01:20:18.110" style="s2">down from internal forces where external</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.660" end="01:20:21.380" style="s2">forces are both right so external forces</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.110" end="01:20:22.790" style="s2">means rival risks type dynamics which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.380" end="01:20:25.580" style="s2">an in-group that is smaller than</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.790" end="01:20:28.130" style="s2">everything given that it is still</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.580" end="01:20:31.070" style="s2">interacting with the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.130" end="01:20:32.930" style="s2">that its embedded in so I would say all</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.070" end="01:20:34.640" style="s2">in groups that are smaller than</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.930" end="01:20:38.410" style="s2">everything have some inherent fragility</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.640" end="01:20:40.880" style="s2">of that kind then we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.410" end="01:20:42.560" style="s2">dynamics on the inside it could cause</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.880" end="01:20:44.210" style="s2">fragility and breakdown which is</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.560" end="01:20:46.280" style="s2">actually going into rival risk type</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.210" end="01:20:48.440" style="s2">dynamics with each other because the</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.280" end="01:20:49.910" style="s2">coherence that brings about the synergy</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.440" end="01:20:51.350" style="s2">that brings about the emergent</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.910" end="01:20:53.630" style="s2">capacities that actually gets selected</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.350" end="01:20:57.950" style="s2">for happens because of a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.630" end="01:21:01.130" style="s2">relating that is anti rival risk it</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.950" end="01:21:01.550" style="s2">allows a very deep type of synergy to</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.130" end="01:21:04.130" style="s2">occur</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.550" end="01:21:08.660" style="s2">I&#39;d like to have a proposal meta and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.130" end="01:21:10.730" style="s2">met I met a move the meta move I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.660" end="01:21:13.280" style="s2">noticing that the conversation has a</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.730" end="01:21:15.350" style="s2">particular topology to it and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.280" end="01:21:18.770" style="s2">curious why that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.350" end="01:21:20.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s meta because I presume that the</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.770" end="01:21:26.930" style="s2">answer to that curiosity will have</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.480" end="01:21:30.230" style="s2">something to do with either homos we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.930" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">in fact primates or something about our</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.230" end="01:21:34.190" style="s2">developmental environment this causes</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:36.760" style="s2">topology to spontaneously emerge which</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.190" end="01:21:38.450" style="s2">is to say that the conversation is a V</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.760" end="01:21:40.340" style="s2">Daniel&#39;s talking to you</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.450" end="01:21:41.720" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to you Daniel and I are not</p>

<p begin="01:21:43.489" end="01:21:48.080" style="s2">like something right there yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.530" end="01:21:49.850" style="s2">that&#39;s one that&#39;s the meta move why why</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.080" end="01:21:53.060" style="s2">is why did that topology settle in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.850" end="01:21:56.660" style="s2">way that it settled in then the meta</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.060" end="01:21:58.700" style="s2">meta move the unfortunate oh the meta</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.660" end="01:22:00.650" style="s2">meta move is of course in the act of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.700" end="01:22:03.620" style="s2">actually contemplating the meta</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.650" end="01:22:05.989" style="s2">we can in fact endeavor to be doing it</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.620" end="01:22:07.730" style="s2">rather than talking about it and we can</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.989" end="01:22:09.110" style="s2">notice how the doing it informs the</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.730" end="01:22:13.820" style="s2">talking about it in a fashion that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.110" end="01:22:17.770" style="s2">resolves the question and in addition to</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.820" end="01:22:22.010" style="s2">the three of us and whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.770" end="01:22:25.130" style="s2">container or emergent is this is also on</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.010" end="01:22:27.680" style="s2">film and there&#39;s the consciousness of</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.130" end="01:22:31.940" style="s2">the people who are watching it which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.680" end="01:22:35.950" style="s2">also sensing into and wanting to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.940" end="01:22:39.170" style="s2">sure that this is hopefully useful for</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.950" end="01:22:41.650" style="s2">so that&#39;s included in the consideration</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.170" end="01:22:44.840" style="s2">something between comprehensible and or</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.650" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">interesting so there&#39;s a third to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.840" end="01:22:48.860" style="s2">enth I mean I I would at least I feel</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.600" end="01:22:52.730" style="s2">like there was there have been moments</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.860" end="01:22:56.270" style="s2">little blips where there&#39;s been at least</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.730" end="01:22:58.790" style="s2">for me new or interesting perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.270" end="01:23:00.830" style="s2">and our house and insights and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.790" end="01:23:02.480" style="s2">know whether that&#39;s things I just</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.830" end="01:23:04.450" style="s2">haven&#39;t heard you guys say before or</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.480" end="01:23:11.120" style="s2">whether those are actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.450" end="01:23:12.560" style="s2">imagined but yes what I&#39;m noticing is</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:14.719" style="s2">that I&#39;m noticing a feeling that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.560" end="01:23:16.040" style="s2">not being something coming from Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.719" end="01:23:17.690" style="s2">that actually creates the right kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.040" end="01:23:19.520" style="s2">symmetry in the conversation so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.690" end="01:23:21.800" style="s2">interested in getting your perspective</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.520" end="01:23:23.960" style="s2">in a fashion that is not responsive but</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.800" end="01:23:26.380" style="s2">is in fact a direct like coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.960" end="01:23:26.380" style="s2">inside out</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:40.870" style="s2">the thing that was feeling to share I</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.360" end="01:23:45.530" style="s2">just didn&#39;t hear a spot where it was in</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.870" end="01:23:47.090" style="s2">it was relevant actually very much</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.530" end="01:23:48.770" style="s2">connects to the conversation that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.090" end="01:23:53.780" style="s2">two of you were having but it was what I</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.770" end="01:23:58.640" style="s2">was thinking about anyways which is this</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.780" end="01:24:01.360" style="s2">relationship between the subordination</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.640" end="01:24:06.290" style="s2">of the individual for the collective and</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.360" end="01:24:10.010" style="s2">the sovereignty of the individual like</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.290" end="01:24:14.390" style="s2">fractal sovereignty and I was thinking</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.010" end="01:24:16.400" style="s2">about the body as an analogy of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.390" end="01:24:19.880" style="s2">such a fascinating thing where all of</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.400" end="01:24:23.360" style="s2">the cells are autonomous agents governed</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.880" end="01:24:24.920" style="s2">by their own internal genetic code they</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.360" end="01:24:27.170" style="s2">could grow in a petri dish for some</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.920" end="01:24:29.540" style="s2">period of time but they&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.170" end="01:24:31.130" style="s2">a way that is both in their own good</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.540" end="01:24:32.630" style="s2">interest and in the interest of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.130" end="01:24:34.640" style="s2">other cells around them in the entire</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.630" end="01:24:37.760" style="s2">body simultaneously so there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.640" end="01:24:39.110" style="s2">theory of trade-offs of what is good for</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.760" end="01:24:41.030" style="s2">them is damaging other or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.110" end="01:24:42.650" style="s2">sacrificing themselves for other and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.030" end="01:24:44.840" style="s2">that&#39;s stripped the level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.650" end="01:24:46.550" style="s2">cell-to-cell but it&#39;s also true at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.840" end="01:24:50.240" style="s2">level of organ to organ and organ</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.550" end="01:24:52.790" style="s2">systems organ system in cell to organ so</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.240" end="01:24:56.300" style="s2">at vertical levels and horizontal levels</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.790" end="01:24:58.700" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of just radical anti</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.300" end="01:24:59.690" style="s2">rival risk synergy of sovereign things</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.700" end="01:25:02.000" style="s2">of things that have their own</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.690" end="01:25:04.430" style="s2">self-organizing boundary the facha of</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.000" end="01:25:06.700" style="s2">the organ the cell membrane and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.430" end="01:25:09.830" style="s2">talking about that at the next level of</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.700" end="01:25:11.450" style="s2">organism to organism and we&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.830" end="01:25:14.600" style="s2">up to tribe and now we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.450" end="01:25:17.690" style="s2">beyond tribal scale but that that kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.600" end="01:25:22.220" style="s2">of process and I&#39;m thinking about cancer</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.690" end="01:25:24.140" style="s2">in the body because a cancer cell starts</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.220" end="01:25:26.420" style="s2">doing what seems to be in the short-term</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.140" end="01:25:29.060" style="s2">better for it it actually replicates it</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.420" end="01:25:30.530" style="s2">consumes and replicates faster but it</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.060" end="01:25:32.660" style="s2">breaks down the coherence of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.530" end="01:25:34.400" style="s2">and in the process it ends up killing</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.660" end="01:25:35.960" style="s2">itself killing its progeny right it</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.400" end="01:25:38.390" style="s2">suicides because it debases the</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.960" end="01:25:41.250" style="s2">substrate that it depends upon and kind</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.390" end="01:25:48.750" style="s2">of a short term small-minded focus</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.250" end="01:25:51.010" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this idea like regard to</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.750" end="01:25:52.810" style="s2">like the there&#39;s an interesting feeling</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.010" end="01:25:56.020" style="s2">even of that way of speaking of it as</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.810" end="01:25:58.570" style="s2">subordinate the individual and I was</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.020" end="01:25:59.830" style="s2">just thinking of Einstein&#39;s quote that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.570" end="01:26:01.570" style="s2">it&#39;s an optical delusion of</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.830" end="01:26:03.790" style="s2">consciousness to think there are</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.570" end="01:26:06.130" style="s2">separate things when in fact there is</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.790" end="01:26:11.190" style="s2">one integrated reality that we call</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.130" end="01:26:14.110" style="s2">universe and so like we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.190" end="01:26:17.320" style="s2">rationally get and something I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.110" end="01:26:18.699" style="s2">about all the time is ok I can think</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.320" end="01:26:21.699" style="s2">about myself as a separate thing but</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.699" end="01:26:23.949" style="s2">what am i without the atmosphere I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.699" end="01:26:25.600" style="s2">even exist what am i without the plants</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.949" end="01:26:27.429" style="s2">that generate the atmosphere I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.600" end="01:26:29.500" style="s2">even exist what am i without the</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.429" end="01:26:31.060" style="s2">electromagnetic field without the earth</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.500" end="01:26:32.620" style="s2">without gravity without the other people</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.060" end="01:26:35.650" style="s2">that made the things that I use and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.620" end="01:26:38.050" style="s2">concepts that I use so when I get that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.650" end="01:26:39.330" style="s2">I&#39;m an emergent property of the hole</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.050" end="01:26:42.250" style="s2">that has uniqueness and individuality</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.330" end="01:26:44.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s not separable from that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.250" end="01:26:47.050" style="s2">distinctness doesn&#39;t mean separable &#39;ti</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.280" end="01:26:49.090" style="s2">then I have both distinct and</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.050" end="01:26:51.699" style="s2">inseparable simultaneously so I have</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.090" end="01:26:54.010" style="s2">interconnected with the whole and having</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.699" end="01:26:55.530" style="s2">a unique role to play and so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.010" end="01:26:58.750" style="s2">dialectic there is something that</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.530" end="01:27:00.940" style="s2">increases actually the distinction in</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.750" end="01:27:06.030" style="s2">the uniqueness and increases the synergy</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.940" end="01:27:08.860" style="s2">and interconnectivity simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.030" end="01:27:10.660" style="s2">the first part is to just recognize if</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.860" end="01:27:12.429" style="s2">I&#39;m doing the cancer thing it will end</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.660" end="01:27:14.530" style="s2">up being bad for what I care about -</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.429" end="01:27:16.989" style="s2">even if in the short term it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.530" end="01:27:18.429" style="s2">a good thing and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.989" end="01:27:21.000" style="s2">thing with rival race game theory that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.429" end="01:27:23.699" style="s2">we&#39;re at the place where we realize</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.000" end="01:27:27.360" style="s2">exponentially larger extraction and</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.699" end="01:27:30.730" style="s2">pollution and war an information war is</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.360" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">existential now so we can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.730" end="01:27:33.910" style="s2">rationalize that we can keep doing it</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:34.900" style="s2">that way I&#39;m noticing as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.910" end="01:27:37.600" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to get to the feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.900" end="01:27:40.929" style="s2">it which is by the way quite hard but</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.600" end="01:27:42.280" style="s2">one of the places I landed was that you</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.929" end="01:27:44.530" style="s2">know we still have that nice example of</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.280" end="01:27:45.790" style="s2">the jazz band unfortunately we actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.530" end="01:27:48.219" style="s2">have concrete examples of what these</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.790" end="01:27:50.320" style="s2">things are like to be in and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.219" end="01:27:53.699" style="s2">noticing that as a player in the jazz</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:53.699" style="s2">band that feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.150" end="01:27:59.760" style="s2">not being subordinated to the whole but</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.929" end="01:28:01.500" style="s2">actually somehow being supported in</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.760" end="01:28:04.530" style="s2">achieving a higher level of</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.500" end="01:28:06.270" style="s2">individuation is felt so the question of</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.530" end="01:28:08.310" style="s2">course was that feel like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.270" end="01:28:12.210" style="s2">interesting to notice that while some</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.310" end="01:28:12.810" style="s2">people not many I think try to think</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.210" end="01:28:14.610" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.810" end="01:28:17.670" style="s2">strategically like okay how do I make</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.610" end="01:28:20.849" style="s2">sure that I am in fact protected most</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.670" end="01:28:23.400" style="s2">people are in fact proceeding by do I</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.849" end="01:28:25.770" style="s2">actually feel like I am increasing my</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.400" end="01:28:27.360" style="s2">autonomy do I feel more agenting and</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.770" end="01:28:30.420" style="s2">more autonomous and more able to express</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.360" end="01:28:33.330" style="s2">my essence or selfness</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.420" end="01:28:35.190" style="s2">into world so immature should like what</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.330" end="01:28:36.810" style="s2">does that feel like to actually move</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.190" end="01:28:37.920" style="s2">into that place and if we could do it</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.810" end="01:28:39.480" style="s2">like what would actually had felt like</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.920" end="01:28:41.219" style="s2">for this single cell going into the</p>

<p begin="01:31:40.160" end="01:31:44.430" style="s2">in a deep way like something in your gut</p>

<p begin="01:32:12.780" end="01:32:17.430" style="s2">on the tightrope in the middle of trying</p>

<p begin="01:32:17.430" end="01:32:20.550" style="s2">from the heart that is very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.900" end="01:32:23.040" style="s2">that you actually call</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.550" end="01:32:25.890" style="s2">what that&#39;s gold well done awesome and</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.040" end="01:32:28.500" style="s2">on the other hand when you feel it know</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.890" end="01:32:31.940" style="s2">there&#39;s something off about that this</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.500" end="01:32:35.310" style="s2">guy here&#39;s faking it that you also</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.940" end="01:32:36.780" style="s2">express that clearly and so the what</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.310" end="01:32:38.940" style="s2">happens you get a very interesting set</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.780" end="01:32:40.530" style="s2">of feedback loops to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.940" end="01:32:43.380" style="s2">everybody is playing the game of both</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.530" end="01:32:45.900" style="s2">participant and curator with</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.380" end="01:32:47.010" style="s2">authenticity and skillfulness you</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.900" end="01:32:49.320" style="s2">actually start getting positive feedback</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.010" end="01:32:54.270" style="s2">loops that move into a space of</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.320" end="01:32:56.340" style="s2">increasingly anti fragile power but if</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.270" end="01:33:00.690" style="s2">there&#39;s defection and the defection here</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.340" end="01:33:01.740" style="s2">I mean things like laziness or bad habit</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.690" end="01:33:03.360" style="s2">or of course obviously just</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.740" end="01:33:05.070" style="s2">old-fashioned defection like oh I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.360" end="01:33:08.640" style="s2">gonna steal that and run with it then it</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.070" end="01:33:10.140" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come together so but this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.640" end="01:33:11.850" style="s2">this this is nice right this is fine</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.140" end="01:33:14.280" style="s2">like two degree to which Jaime you show</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.850" end="01:33:15.630" style="s2">up consistently every single time</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.280" end="01:33:17.760" style="s2">willing to put it on the line and</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.630" end="01:33:22.290" style="s2">calling what is true true and calling</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.760" end="01:33:25.020" style="s2">what is false false then and I meet you</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.290" end="01:33:26.040" style="s2">there trying to do the same thing what</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.020" end="01:33:28.260" style="s2">ends up happening is that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.040" end="01:33:30.120" style="s2">build a relationship that has resilience</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.260" end="01:33:31.470" style="s2">to it there&#39;s strength to it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.120" end="01:33:34.110" style="s2">strength to it both in the sense that we</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.470" end="01:33:36.360" style="s2">can have confidence in it and it says</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.110" end="01:33:38.460" style="s2">that it can do more than a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.360" end="01:33:41.220" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have that in it so there is</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.460" end="01:33:43.370" style="s2">actually a natural like orientation</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.220" end="01:33:47.540" style="s2">towards strength that does show up there</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.370" end="01:33:49.050" style="s2">but is also based on skillfulness</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.540" end="01:33:51.120" style="s2">determined at the bottle to be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.050" end="01:33:52.800" style="s2">consumer and a curator because otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.120" end="01:33:55.890" style="s2">you got the difference between Burning</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.800" end="01:33:58.320" style="s2">Man and fire festival yeah well this is</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.890" end="01:34:00.240" style="s2">goes back to that problem of society so</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.320" end="01:34:01.950" style="s2">much of discernment is just like almost</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.240" end="01:34:05.070" style="s2">the first thing that is beaten out is</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.950" end="01:34:07.440" style="s2">discernment and so being able to come</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.070" end="01:34:09.570" style="s2">back and do things like recognize the</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.440" end="01:34:12.300" style="s2">whole thing here is part of discernment</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.570" end="01:34:14.160" style="s2">and being able to listen and say okay my</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.300" end="01:34:16.290" style="s2">heart aches when somebody says something</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.160" end="01:34:18.840" style="s2">all right well that&#39;s probably real deep</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.290" end="01:34:20.760" style="s2">important true learn how to listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.840" end="01:34:22.980" style="s2">learn how to speak what it means with</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.760" end="01:34:25.560" style="s2">clarity so this is like an that minimum</p>

<p begin="01:34:25.560" end="01:34:30.990" style="s2">ingredient and in short supply these</p>

<p begin="01:34:30.990" end="01:34:33.360" style="s2">everywhere can actually improve the</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.190" end="01:34:33.739" style="s2">discernment where they are and it will</p>

<p begin="01:34:45.800" end="01:34:51.050" style="s2">to yet but actually was feeling into and</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.310" end="01:34:53.050" style="s2">wanted to speak to the kind of topology</p>

<p begin="01:35:01.250" end="01:35:06.560" style="s2">in the corner and it&#39;s literally just</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.020" end="01:35:09.200" style="s2">the physicality of it there&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.560" end="01:35:10.610" style="s2">number of factors but it makes heaps of</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.200" end="01:35:12.020" style="s2">sense that you and I have actually got</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.610" end="01:35:13.850" style="s2">to have more conversations on these</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.020" end="01:35:16.880" style="s2">topics more recently than we have</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.850" end="01:35:19.219" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an assumed knowing we</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.880" end="01:35:20.570" style="s2">didn&#39;t all get to jam before on this or</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.219" end="01:35:23.180" style="s2">prepare this this is real-time</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.570" end="01:35:26.030" style="s2">extemporaneous and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.180" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever even expressed Rule Omega to</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.030" end="01:35:35.210" style="s2">Jamie but he&#39;s just doing it yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.400" end="01:35:36.739" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of openly inquiring into the</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.210" end="01:35:39.050" style="s2">questions that are really alive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.739" end="01:35:40.340" style="s2">a little bit easier for us to riff off</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.050" end="01:35:42.230" style="s2">what each other saying because we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.340" end="01:35:45.140" style="s2">some recently shared language on these</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.230" end="01:35:47.420" style="s2">things and but the rule Omega is</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.140" end="01:35:50.360" style="s2">actually a really simple practical thing</p>

<p begin="01:35:58.370" end="01:36:02.600" style="s2">talking like we we have this and I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.130" end="01:36:06.310" style="s2">we naturally had it as worth making</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.600" end="01:36:10.820" style="s2">explicit is if you say something that</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.310" end="01:36:13.610" style="s2">sounds ridiculous to me or batshit crazy</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.820" end="01:36:17.000" style="s2">or wrong I actually give the benefit of</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.610" end="01:36:19.489" style="s2">the doubt that you might have a reason</p>

<p begin="01:36:19.489" end="01:36:25.520" style="s2">than just default into you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.320" end="01:36:27.230" style="s2">wrong I&#39;ll ask more questions and and</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.520" end="01:36:28.670" style="s2">that giving the benefit of the doubt</p>

<p begin="01:36:28.670" end="01:36:34.460" style="s2">useful to say increases my making sure</p>

<p begin="01:36:34.460" end="01:36:38.120" style="s2">responding and that actually and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.590" end="01:36:39.290" style="s2">disagreeing was something that you</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.120" end="01:36:41.270" style="s2">weren&#39;t even saying because I didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:36:41.270" end="01:36:46.590" style="s2">very turbulent flow rather than laminar</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.820" end="01:36:49.470" style="s2">flow breaks down coherence right</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.590" end="01:36:51.210" style="s2">if people could just do that towards</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.470" end="01:36:53.810" style="s2">coherence if they could just give the</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.210" end="01:36:58.860" style="s2">benefit of the doubt that each other</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.810" end="01:37:00.480" style="s2">that everyone has some signal even if</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.860" end="01:37:01.680" style="s2">it&#39;s on a very different part of reality</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.480" end="01:37:03.750" style="s2">than the part they&#39;re focused on and</p>

<p begin="01:37:03.750" end="01:37:08.580" style="s2">they&#39;re listening for the signal first</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.590" end="01:37:10.860" style="s2">that would change everything</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.580" end="01:37:12.450" style="s2">that&#39;s a starting place so Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.860" end="01:37:14.190" style="s2">expresses something and let&#39;s see he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.450" end="01:37:15.540" style="s2">trying to express something&#39;s hard which</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.190" end="01:37:18.960" style="s2">by the way the rule make is designed for</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.540" end="01:37:20.280" style="s2">that kind of a thing like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.960" end="01:37:21.330" style="s2">interested in having conversations that</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.280" end="01:37:23.910" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually trying to break new</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.330" end="01:37:26.460" style="s2">ground so okay do it dude so you</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.910" end="01:37:29.010" style="s2">expressing something hard and in the</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.460" end="01:37:31.380" style="s2">expression ninety-eight percent is noise</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.010" end="01:37:33.600" style="s2">and two percent is signal like the jazz</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.380" end="01:37:36.120" style="s2">riff but what happens is that my job is</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.600" end="01:37:39.180" style="s2">to actually do two things one hold all</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.120" end="01:37:40.230" style="s2">of it not just say it that was that</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.180" end="01:37:42.750" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a hundred percent right so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.230" end="01:37:45.750" style="s2">just gonna nuke it hold all of it then</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.750" end="01:37:48.420" style="s2">in my self discernment to what degree</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.750" end="01:37:50.250" style="s2">can i express something back that gets</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.420" end="01:37:53.990" style="s2">rid of the fifty fifty percent that is</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.250" end="01:37:56.340" style="s2">noise so now I&#39;ve got six percent signal</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.990" end="01:37:58.770" style="s2">express it back and of course if he can</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.340" end="01:38:00.030" style="s2">then do that and now you three is even</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.770" end="01:38:01.350" style="s2">better a more profound instrument</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.030" end="01:38:02.490" style="s2">because you&#39;re gonna be bringing a</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.350" end="01:38:04.500" style="s2">different perspective perhaps you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.490" end="01:38:06.030" style="s2">take it and actually zoom in on it down</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.500" end="01:38:08.700" style="s2">to the poem you&#39;re actually 50% signal</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.030" end="01:38:10.410" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea and so one it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.700" end="01:38:11.790" style="s2">invitation say hey we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.410" end="01:38:13.350" style="s2">something&#39;s hard let&#39;s all try to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.790" end="01:38:19.170" style="s2">something that&#39;s hard to be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.350" end="01:38:24.420" style="s2">take the risk of not speaking elegantly</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.170" end="01:38:26.670" style="s2">and on the premise that everyone else is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.420" end="01:38:30.090" style="s2">doing their absolute level best</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.670" end="01:38:32.430" style="s2">to hear that which is trying to speak</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.090" end="01:38:34.290" style="s2">itself through you and listening them is</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.430" end="01:38:36.600" style="s2">in themselves like oh there it is tone</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.290" end="01:38:38.370" style="s2">got it there&#39;s something beautiful and</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.600" end="01:38:40.320" style="s2">clear there here&#39;s what I heard and</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.370" end="01:38:43.260" style="s2">that&#39;s weird Omega and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.320" end="01:38:45.600" style="s2">psychological safety that&#39;s created to</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.260" end="01:38:48.150" style="s2">be able to try out new stuff knowing</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.600" end="01:38:49.650" style="s2">that we know we&#39;re trying out new stuff</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.150" end="01:38:51.510" style="s2">we&#39;re giving the benefit of the doubt so</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.650" end="01:38:53.450" style="s2">it actually does become more explorative</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.510" end="01:38:55.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s where you get more novelty</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.450" end="01:38:56.670" style="s2">and then I imagine I don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.530" end="01:38:57.720" style="s2">is true for Daniel I imagine it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.670" end="01:38:59.520" style="s2">for you but certainly if it&#39;s true for</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.720" end="01:39:00.520" style="s2">me is that I&#39;m also noticing it myself</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.520" end="01:39:01.960" style="s2">but this</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.520" end="01:39:04.180" style="s2">constant you know when you&#39;re meditating</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.960" end="01:39:05.650" style="s2">you feel this this constant chatter and</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.180" end="01:39:08.020" style="s2">flow of like all the things that are</p>
<p begin="01:39:05.650" end="01:39:09.460" style="s2">going on internally that are either like</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.020" end="01:39:11.620" style="s2">certain ideas are popping up or</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.460" end="01:39:13.900" style="s2">emotional responses some of them are</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.620" end="01:39:15.460" style="s2">like social emotional responses some of</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.900" end="01:39:18.250" style="s2">them are like just like I got a P and</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.460" end="01:39:20.920" style="s2">like being able to actually notice all</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.250" end="01:39:22.960" style="s2">that chatter internally and do the</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.920" end="01:39:24.220" style="s2">disturbing interior and say okay Paul</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.960" end="01:39:25.990" style="s2">that chatter which have a heart that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.220" end="01:39:28.210" style="s2">actually signal oh</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.990" end="01:39:30.700" style="s2">but listen to all of it you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.210" end="01:39:32.650" style="s2">you&#39;ll make it goes in and out right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.700" end="01:39:34.540" style="s2">listening to myself fully and I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="01:39:38.460" end="01:39:46.090" style="s2">that into gold now there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.300" end="01:39:48.160" style="s2">important distinction that we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.090" end="01:39:49.330" style="s2">something that is different than the way</p>

<p begin="01:39:49.330" end="01:39:57.430" style="s2">multi-perspective ism which is we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="01:41:17.940" end="01:41:21.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s truth in it it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.920" end="01:41:24.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s the truth</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.240" end="01:41:25.620" style="s2">or it&#39;s true with a capital T and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.030" end="01:41:28.440" style="s2">like an immaturity we have to get over</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.620" end="01:41:30.780" style="s2">there&#39;s some truth and I&#39;m positive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.440" end="01:41:32.370" style="s2">incomplete and I think there&#39;s a pretty</p>

<p begin="01:41:32.370" end="01:41:35.310" style="s2">the situation you might have some</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.630" end="01:41:38.010" style="s2">additional truth that I actually really</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.310" end="01:41:40.620" style="s2">want which means truth is trans</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.010" end="01:41:42.030" style="s2">perspectival and Jordan was saying</p>

<p begin="01:41:42.030" end="01:41:45.540" style="s2">meaning I have to take multiple</p>
<p begin="01:41:43.170" end="01:41:47.820" style="s2">perspectives through multiple types of</p>
<p begin="01:41:45.540" end="01:41:49.920" style="s2">interpretation that was at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:41:47.820" end="01:41:51.210" style="s2">saying like the words aren&#39;t gonna quite</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.920" end="01:41:53.070" style="s2">get it so we&#39;re gonna have to come at it</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.210" end="01:41:55.020" style="s2">from different perspectives because the</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.070" end="01:41:56.670" style="s2">words are also in a reduction on the</p>

<p begin="01:41:56.670" end="01:42:02.070" style="s2">is also a big part of that what happens</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.380" end="01:42:06.380" style="s2">in the post I have pre trans you know</p>
<p begin="01:42:02.070" end="01:42:08.370" style="s2">what&#39;s why is this not a Quaker meeting</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.380" end="01:42:11.460" style="s2">the Quakers are doing something awesome</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.370" end="01:42:12.600" style="s2">but they&#39;re running one paradigm we have</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.460" end="01:42:14.310" style="s2">to actually say it&#39;s okay let&#39;s run</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.600" end="01:42:16.200" style="s2">what&#39;s what the very minimum from both</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.310" end="01:42:19.020" style="s2">the Lakota and the Quaker paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.200" end="01:42:21.690" style="s2">while we&#39;re at it I&#39;m usually running I</p>

<p begin="01:42:21.690" end="01:42:26.220" style="s2">simultaneously all the time and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.060" end="01:42:27.870" style="s2">many and ie and it is not to try to</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.220" end="01:42:29.970" style="s2">collapse them down to a single master</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.870" end="01:42:31.290" style="s2">paradigm but actually to allow each one</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.970" end="01:42:32.910" style="s2">of them to have the particular piece</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.290" end="01:42:35.070" style="s2">that they&#39;re holding just like eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.910" end="01:42:36.240" style="s2">ears say okay cool this paradigm is able</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.070" end="01:42:38.130" style="s2">to grasp things in a certain way this</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.240" end="01:42:39.780" style="s2">one doesn&#39;t that&#39;s neat recognizing</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.130" end="01:42:42.090" style="s2">always that you&#39;re never going to be</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.780" end="01:42:43.230" style="s2">able to perceive reality but that by</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.090" end="01:42:45.600" style="s2">virtue of getting more and more</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.230" end="01:42:47.850" style="s2">dimensions of parallax you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.600" end="01:42:52.110" style="s2">have more possibility of having some</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.850" end="01:42:55.380" style="s2">insight and it&#39;s the insight is the key</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.110" end="01:42:58.200" style="s2">not the sense so you&#39;re actually going</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.380" end="01:43:03.990" style="s2">from sense making into insight which is</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.200" end="01:43:06.690" style="s2">very different means you sort of outside</p>
<p begin="01:43:03.990" end="01:43:10.470" style="s2">in inside out yeah right that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.690" end="01:43:12.930" style="s2">trying to actually build a capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.470" end="01:43:16.320" style="s2">be someone who does rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.930" end="01:43:18.000" style="s2">knowledge you want to understand oh</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.320" end="01:43:20.190" style="s2">what&#39;s happening you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.000" end="01:43:21.840" style="s2">respond to what&#39;s happening so it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.190" end="01:43:25.320" style="s2">you become a musician by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.840" end="01:43:29.190" style="s2">having a skillful portfolio of</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.320" end="01:43:31.680" style="s2">sensitive qualities in self and then a</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.190" end="01:43:33.810" style="s2">skillful mapping of that into expression</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.680" end="01:43:35.010" style="s2">you don&#39;t become a musician by being</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.810" end="01:43:41.130" style="s2">very good at reading somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.010" end="01:43:42.900" style="s2">music so there&#39;s something I the thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.130" end="01:43:44.460" style="s2">that I was actually saying that I wanted</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.900" end="01:43:49.770" style="s2">to add to the conversation has to do</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.460" end="01:43:53.370" style="s2">with the rival risk nature of ego so</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.770" end="01:43:55.830" style="s2">like when you talk about falling out of</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.370" end="01:43:57.240" style="s2">it the fact that we exist within a macro</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.830" end="01:43:59.970" style="s2">economy where we have private balance</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.240" end="01:44:01.350" style="s2">sheets and our balance sheets are rival</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.970" end="01:44:03.930" style="s2">risk meaning I can advance mine by</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.350" end="01:44:06.540" style="s2">ripping your stuff off and vice versa we</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.930" end="01:44:08.520" style="s2">have we have structural basis for</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.540" end="01:44:10.050" style="s2">rivalry because they involved in a rival</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.520" end="01:44:12.780" style="s2">risk context we have to change that so</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.050" end="01:44:15.000" style="s2">there&#39;s like not just a new sense making</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.780" end="01:44:16.940" style="s2">and culture and experience but also new</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.000" end="01:44:19.800" style="s2">infrastructure and new social structures</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.940" end="01:44:22.350" style="s2">probably beyond the scope of what we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.800" end="01:44:25.050" style="s2">get to today but even we take the</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.350" end="01:44:27.600" style="s2">balance sheet away there&#39;s the like is</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.050" end="01:44:30.330" style="s2">someone wanting to take up more space in</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.600" end="01:44:34.020" style="s2">the jam session because of unmet</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.330" end="01:44:35.760" style="s2">identity needs and do they actually care</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.020" end="01:44:38.220" style="s2">about the felt experience of somebody</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.760" end="01:44:42.420" style="s2">else who&#39;s seeking to express something</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.220" end="01:44:44.730" style="s2">and we actually feel do we actually feel</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.420" end="01:44:46.380" style="s2">each other and are we coming from enough</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.730" end="01:44:48.090" style="s2">wholeness that I&#39;m not relating out of</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.380" end="01:44:49.800" style="s2">need most of the time yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.090" end="01:44:52.170" style="s2">musicians call that cutting right like</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.800" end="01:44:54.930" style="s2">ever like if somebody deliberately out</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.170" end="01:44:56.930" style="s2">plays the other person and leaves that</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.930" end="01:44:59.760" style="s2">and leaves their contribution diminished</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.930" end="01:45:01.110" style="s2">versus accretive yeah right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.760" end="01:45:03.420" style="s2">cutting sessions in this bad boy</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.110" end="01:45:04.620" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah so notice you know if we</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.420" end="01:45:06.450" style="s2">switch this domain I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.620" end="01:45:07.500" style="s2">the folks in this side of the camera so</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.450" end="01:45:09.330" style="s2">let&#39;s take this and make this practical</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.500" end="01:45:15.360" style="s2">in the context of sense making in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.330" end="01:45:16.740" style="s2">world do we live in right now almost</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.360" end="01:45:18.420" style="s2">everything that we&#39;re talking about if</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.740" end="01:45:19.920" style="s2">you apply it one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.420" end="01:45:22.560" style="s2">notice of course is that all the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.920" end="01:45:28.290" style="s2">that typically goes under the heading of</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.560" end="01:45:32.040" style="s2">sense making is worse than useless so</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.290" end="01:45:33.630" style="s2">any newspaper any news program pretty</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.040" end="01:45:34.980" style="s2">much every scientific paper to be</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.630" end="01:45:36.810" style="s2">perfectly frank you know we&#39;ve done that</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.980" end="01:45:37.830" style="s2">analysis and taking a look at how a few</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.810" end="01:45:39.270" style="s2">of them are replicable</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.830" end="01:45:41.880" style="s2">and how much of an incentive structure</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.270" end="01:45:47.340" style="s2">there is for actually lying to be able</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.880" end="01:45:48.600" style="s2">to generate local selective advantage at</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.340" end="01:45:51.810" style="s2">least misinterpreting yeah or</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.600" end="01:45:57.480" style="s2">overstating or whatever it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.810" end="01:45:59.270" style="s2">mess so game a as a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.480" end="01:46:02.570" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.270" end="01:46:04.680" style="s2">broadly speaking waste of time</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.570" end="01:46:06.690" style="s2">well that opens up some very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.680" end="01:46:08.480" style="s2">challenges and this goes back to the</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.690" end="01:46:13.920" style="s2">notion of game B being immature</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.480" end="01:46:18.030" style="s2">infantile no zygotic haha but where we</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.920" end="01:46:26.690" style="s2">are now I would say is holding yourself</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.030" end="01:46:35.190" style="s2">a feeling of care for everything and</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.690" end="01:46:37.160" style="s2">then truly act and make sense in the</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.190" end="01:46:39.060" style="s2">direction of your actual responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.160" end="01:46:40.560" style="s2">which I believe has been said more</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.060" end="01:46:41.150" style="s2">elegantly as what does it think globally</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.560" end="01:46:44.160" style="s2">act locally</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.150" end="01:46:46.500" style="s2">just take that seriously but the reality</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.160" end="01:46:48.870" style="s2">is is that everybody&#39;s got plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.500" end="01:46:50.310" style="s2">work to do at home and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.870" end="01:46:53.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying what I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.310" end="01:46:54.750" style="s2">articulating is that to do this thing to</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.460" end="01:46:56.250" style="s2">come into coherence to play game B</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.750" end="01:46:57.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of work that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.250" end="01:47:00.720" style="s2">done in the individual in yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.810" end="01:47:02.310" style="s2">then the way to learn how to do</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.720" end="01:47:03.390" style="s2">coherence is always going to be with</p>

<p begin="01:47:19.320" end="01:47:22.860" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely going to be the fabric</p>

<p begin="01:47:22.860" end="01:47:28.920" style="s2">takes time for sure and it takes doing</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.150" end="01:47:30.270" style="s2">the hard human stuff so you actually</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.920" end="01:47:32.370" style="s2">have an embodied experience of what it</p>

<p begin="01:47:49.090" end="01:47:55.250" style="s2">honestly not to make yourself feel good</p>

<p begin="01:47:55.250" end="01:47:59.630" style="s2">real then the path to get there is this</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.980" end="01:48:02.570" style="s2">path that starts here</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.630" end="01:48:03.800" style="s2">in yourself and moves out in spirals</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.570" end="01:48:06.369" style="s2">through things that you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.800" end="01:48:10.730" style="s2">touch and truly take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.369" end="01:48:13.280" style="s2">and then always showing up from that</p>

<p begin="01:48:13.280" end="01:48:20.599" style="s2">so that feels like here is Jenny 101 or</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.030" end="01:48:23.059" style="s2">Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz right well</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.599" end="01:48:27.079" style="s2">you&#39;re saying hey the way forward into</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.059" end="01:48:30.440" style="s2">game B and emergent coherence is to</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.079" end="01:48:33.849" style="s2">actually come all the way back home to</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.440" end="01:48:36.800" style="s2">the basics of good old-fashioned</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.849" end="01:48:39.949" style="s2">humanity but in order for me to be able</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.800" end="01:48:42.380" style="s2">to reanimate and fully live into the</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.949" end="01:48:44.679" style="s2">basics of good old-fashioned humanity I</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.380" end="01:48:47.540" style="s2">actually have to have gone on some</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.679" end="01:48:50.119" style="s2">initiatory transformative journey in</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.540" end="01:48:51.980" style="s2">order to remember in fact that</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.119" end="01:48:53.570" style="s2">cow town in Kansas is the best place</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.980" end="01:48:55.520" style="s2">ever and there&#39;s no place like home</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.570" end="01:48:56.480" style="s2">nice so you just join I get it well</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.520" end="01:48:58.909" style="s2">they&#39;re adding those two together it</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.480" end="01:49:00.920" style="s2">comes clear beautiful yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.909" end="01:49:04.880" style="s2">very nice is race it&#39;s actually odd how</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.920" end="01:49:06.079" style="s2">simple and like plain things are and of</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.880" end="01:49:07.820" style="s2">course what&#39;s interesting is that once</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.079" end="01:49:10.250" style="s2">you grasp that once it once it lands you</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.820" end="01:49:14.239" style="s2">begin to see how the the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.250" end="01:49:15.409" style="s2">challenges begin to self resolve there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.239" end="01:49:17.239" style="s2">a point you made that wasn&#39;t the main</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.409" end="01:49:20.570" style="s2">point it was a tangent but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.239" end="01:49:23.630" style="s2">super critical so I want to emphasize it</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.570" end="01:49:24.650" style="s2">which is okay so why can&#39;t we trust any</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.630" end="01:49:25.400" style="s2">of the things that normally look like</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.650" end="01:49:26.540" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.400" end="01:49:30.260" style="s2">well there&#39;s a bunch of reasons but</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.540" end="01:49:32.210" style="s2">basically we learn how to do signaling</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.260" end="01:49:34.880" style="s2">for intentional game theoretic purposes</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.210" end="01:49:37.040" style="s2">and so rather than just share signal</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.880" end="01:49:38.389" style="s2">that is true and representative we share</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.040" end="01:49:40.040" style="s2">signal that will advantage some</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.389" end="01:49:44.829" style="s2">rivalries agenda</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.040" end="01:49:44.829" style="s2">so most signal ends up being that and</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.099" end="01:49:52.460" style="s2">one of the things that you were just</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.840" end="01:49:54.739" style="s2">saying is a consequence of it is that</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.460" end="01:49:57.500" style="s2">there&#39;s an ethic to not up the</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.739" end="01:49:59.090" style="s2">information ecology right like in the</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.500" end="01:50:00.739" style="s2">same way that we say don&#39;t pollute and</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.090" end="01:50:01.079" style="s2">most people get pretty comfortable that</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.739" end="01:50:02.300" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.079" end="01:50:06.989" style="s2">or your cigarette butt on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.300" end="01:50:09.719" style="s2">don&#39;t actually dissing form anybody else</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.989" end="01:50:11.999" style="s2">for your own getting ahead or withhold</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.719" end="01:50:14.099" style="s2">information where you can avoid doing so</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.999" end="01:50:15.780" style="s2">because you&#39;re actually disempowering</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.099" end="01:50:17.909" style="s2">the sense making of others in the</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.780" end="01:50:20.639" style="s2">process and to really be tuned into as</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.909" end="01:50:22.379" style="s2">though as I&#39;m seeking to make sense I</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.639" end="01:50:23.939" style="s2">want to increase other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.379" end="01:50:25.859" style="s2">sovereignty in their capacity to make</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.939" end="01:50:27.359" style="s2">sense so I want to increase the intact</p>

<p begin="01:50:27.359" end="01:50:31.019" style="s2">exposed to rather than decrease it right</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.369" end="01:50:36.389" style="s2">up to but not beyond the point of</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.019" end="01:50:41.489" style="s2">boström and those guys info hazards</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.389" end="01:50:45.749" style="s2">yeah-oh to the degree that someone else</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.489" end="01:50:47.280" style="s2">has clearly rival risks agenda with</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.749" end="01:50:48.839" style="s2">regard to information then you have to</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.280" end="01:50:50.339" style="s2">factor that in so far as sharing</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.839" end="01:50:53.879" style="s2">information with them within decrease</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.339" end="01:50:55.349" style="s2">sovereignty for lots of people but glue</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.879" end="01:50:58.530" style="s2">together what Daniel said and when you</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.349" end="01:51:00.539" style="s2">just added to what I was saying to</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.530" end="01:51:03.449" style="s2">degree which I&#39;m playing this game with</p>

<p begin="01:51:03.449" end="01:51:09.419" style="s2">never meet I&#39;m probably gonna lose I</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.129" end="01:51:11.609" style="s2">don&#39;t haven&#39;t how much info in for</p>

<p begin="01:51:16.139" end="01:51:18.839" style="s2">a dick to agree shouldn&#39;t playing with</p>

<p begin="01:51:23.070" end="01:51:25.499" style="s2">playing it trying to say okay hold on</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.419" end="01:51:28.019" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to solve the game theoretic</p>

<p begin="01:52:53.080" end="01:53:01.810" style="s2">I mean by that is to only have your</p>

<p begin="01:53:51.219" end="01:53:55.030" style="s2">thing that&#39;s helpful is that each cell</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.199" end="01:53:57.400" style="s2">is being modulated by the cells near in</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.030" end="01:54:00.010" style="s2">to come back in to check and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.400" end="01:54:02.050" style="s2">error correction processes okay</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.010" end="01:54:04.060" style="s2">so let&#39;s unpack that because so for sure</p>
<p begin="01:54:02.050" end="01:54:06.190" style="s2">you said hey think globally act locally</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.060" end="01:54:08.380" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t scale fast at all</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.190" end="01:54:10.239" style="s2">you talk about developmental processes</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.380" end="01:54:13.540" style="s2">patients that stuff doesn&#39;t meet</p>

<p begin="01:54:18.190" end="01:54:24.480" style="s2">of politics of suspicion effectively</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.389" end="01:54:26.580" style="s2">right and and the idea that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:54:26.580" end="01:54:29.640" style="s2">you know the secret with an inner</p>

<p begin="01:54:36.660" end="01:54:40.560" style="s2">the kind of those sort of things there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.830" end="01:54:42.890" style="s2">filters and gates of who had access to</p>

<p begin="01:54:47.760" end="01:54:53.070" style="s2">example like Sasha Shogun right so the</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.710" end="01:54:55.980" style="s2">chemists who you know re popularized</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.070" end="01:54:58.290" style="s2">MDMA created a lot of you know designer</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.980" end="01:55:00.840" style="s2">molecules compounds and psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.290" end="01:55:02.760" style="s2">then was collaborating with the DEA and</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.840" end="01:55:04.140" style="s2">then when the DEA looked like they were</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.760" end="01:55:05.940" style="s2">going to be shutting down and repressing</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.140" end="01:55:09.450" style="s2">that information published his two</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.940" end="01:55:10.590" style="s2">cookbooks where he open sourced I said</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.450" end="01:55:13.800" style="s2">it&#39;s basically about open sourcing</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.590" end="01:55:16.290" style="s2">versus closed source and he opened</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.800" end="01:55:19.200" style="s2">source all that information now net</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.290" end="01:55:21.510" style="s2">positive on the world but if we use him</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.200" end="01:55:22.020" style="s2">as an example if he went the open source</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.510" end="01:55:25.140" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.020" end="01:55:26.970" style="s2">now you also ended up with street corner</p>

<p begin="01:55:26.970" end="01:55:30.150" style="s2">never would have been able to do without</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.230" end="01:55:31.680" style="s2">his two books published you also ended</p>

<p begin="01:55:39.030" end="01:55:43.710" style="s2">cloistered and how does the notion of</p>

<p begin="01:55:43.710" end="01:55:49.940" style="s2">was the only shot we&#39;ve got to avoid</p>

<p begin="01:55:49.940" end="01:55:55.290" style="s2">collapse into hedonism and particularly</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.640" end="01:55:56.760" style="s2">the first two are just better funded</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.290" end="01:55:59.160" style="s2">better focused they&#39;re gonna beat our</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.760" end="01:56:02.550" style="s2">asses every time is to open source</p>

<p begin="01:56:11.520" end="01:56:15.570" style="s2">whether that&#39;s wise but that was the</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.350" end="01:56:17.850" style="s2">best idea I had at the time so</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.570" end="01:56:21.330" style="s2">like what did we think about that could</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.850" end="01:56:23.580" style="s2">you could say just dump it all out there</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.330" end="01:56:25.950" style="s2">publish it let the chips fall and hope</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.580" end="01:56:28.080" style="s2">that the Rebel Alliance right somehow</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.950" end="01:56:29.520" style="s2">hangs onto the plans for the Death Star</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.080" end="01:56:31.140" style="s2">ahead of the instead of the empire</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.520" end="01:56:33.120" style="s2">building even better desto what I was</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.140" end="01:56:36.900" style="s2">thinking as you&#39;re saying that was Lucy</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.120" end="01:56:37.890" style="s2">she&#39;s dead metaphor while the stuff was</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.900" end="01:56:39.450" style="s2">going through me as you were as you were</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.890" end="01:56:40.219" style="s2">talking and one of the things that came</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.450" end="01:56:43.730" style="s2">to me was</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.219" end="01:56:46.940" style="s2">I feel reasonably confident that there</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.730" end="01:56:50.060" style="s2">are in fact things that are appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.940" end="01:56:52.090" style="s2">to being open sourced we actually</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.060" end="01:56:54.230" style="s2">mentioned one earlier discernment so</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.090" end="01:56:57.320" style="s2">discernment is the sort of thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.230" end="01:56:58.420" style="s2">somehow that&#39;s just uncapturable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.320" end="01:57:01.010" style="s2">anti capturable</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.420" end="01:57:02.690" style="s2">so two degree to which somebody actually</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.010" end="01:57:05.360" style="s2">goes to the process of building their</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.690" end="01:57:07.280" style="s2">discernment they are in fact more likely</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.360" end="01:57:11.270" style="s2">to become an ally than they would</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.280" end="01:57:14.960" style="s2">otherwise have been for example and so</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.270" end="01:57:17.210" style="s2">the Rebel Alliance shouldn&#39;t be building</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.960" end="01:57:18.640" style="s2">or outsourced in our open sourcing plans</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.210" end="01:57:20.960" style="s2">on building Death Star&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.640" end="01:57:22.489" style="s2">they should be building an open sourcing</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.960" end="01:57:24.530" style="s2">plans on how to build a Rebel Alliance</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.489" end="01:57:26.870" style="s2">so that if the import what about</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.530" end="01:57:28.850" style="s2">lightsabers hold on it&#39;s just so if the</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.870" end="01:57:30.380" style="s2">Empire gets a hold of the plans all that</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.850" end="01:57:31.489" style="s2">happens is the Empire becomes more Rebel</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.380" end="01:57:37.610" style="s2">Alliance and less Empire</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.489" end="01:57:38.900" style="s2">so not lightsabers not lightsabers this</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.610" end="01:57:43.100" style="s2">is this is actually a really tricky</p>
<p begin="01:57:38.900" end="01:57:46.790" style="s2">topic one relevant concept is the</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.100" end="01:57:49.340" style="s2">concept of safe to fail probes and so in</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.790" end="01:57:51.560" style="s2">you were mentioning earlier that the</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.340" end="01:57:53.810" style="s2">people who went into the Arctic like</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.560" end="01:57:55.610" style="s2">probably most of them failed and then</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.810" end="01:57:56.800" style="s2">some smalls that figured out how to make</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.610" end="01:58:00.020" style="s2">it and then those are the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.800" end="01:58:02.469" style="s2">figured it out right so and the same</p>
<p begin="01:58:00.020" end="01:58:04.969" style="s2">with the jazz riff where it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.469" end="01:58:08.750" style="s2">gibberish but some beautiful thing comes</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.969" end="01:58:10.489" style="s2">evolution has a very high fail rate but</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.750" end="01:58:11.989" style="s2">it&#39;s exploring a wide search space and</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.489" end="01:58:15.110" style="s2">then the things that make it through or</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.989" end="01:58:16.790" style="s2">awesome right and one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.110" end="01:58:19.880" style="s2">you&#39;re asking about timing is can we do</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.790" end="01:58:22.640" style="s2">an evolutionary process factoring the</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.880" end="01:58:25.070" style="s2">time that we have and can we keep</p>
<p begin="01:58:22.640" end="01:58:26.390" style="s2">allowing failure with exponential</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.070" end="01:58:30.199" style="s2">failure possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.390" end="01:58:31.640" style="s2">and so the CDC open sourcing everything</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.199" end="01:58:34.760" style="s2">that it knows about bioweapons would be</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.640" end="01:58:35.810" style="s2">stupid because on one hand you could say</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.760" end="01:58:37.040" style="s2">well it&#39;s cool that they&#39;re open</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.810" end="01:58:39.199" style="s2">sourcing the knowledge so more people</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.040" end="01:58:40.850" style="s2">can work on protecting against it except</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.199" end="01:58:42.890" style="s2">you actually have more capacity for that</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.850" end="01:58:46.070" style="s2">knowledge to be harmful than to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.890" end="01:58:47.909" style="s2">beneficial and with bioweapons or with</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.070" end="01:58:51.599" style="s2">anything that can be weaponized at that</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.909" end="01:58:53.570" style="s2">scope with AI with nanotech with you</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.599" end="01:58:56.489" style="s2">really have different considerations</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.570" end="01:59:00.959" style="s2">because you can&#39;t really control safe to</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.489" end="01:59:02.610" style="s2">fail probes and say so say that again</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.959" end="01:59:05.969" style="s2">like just just phrase that a different</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.610" end="01:59:07.469" style="s2">way if the worst thing that can happen</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.969" end="01:59:10.199" style="s2">is your Jam isn&#39;t that good</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.469" end="01:59:11.579" style="s2">like that&#39;s not that bad it&#39;s a bummer</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.199" end="01:59:13.199" style="s2">and you the next thing you have a better</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.579" end="01:59:15.689" style="s2">Jam if the worst thing that happens is</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.199" end="01:59:17.550" style="s2">you release a autopoietic pattern</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.689" end="01:59:19.229" style="s2">replicator that kills all life you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.550" end="01:59:22.320" style="s2"> around with like playing with that</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.229" end="01:59:24.150" style="s2">thing and so you you actually have to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.320" end="01:59:28.380" style="s2">much more careful that if anyone is</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.150" end="01:59:30.050" style="s2">exploring how to create antifragility to</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.380" end="01:59:33.030" style="s2">that knowledge that should be held</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.050" end="01:59:35.760" style="s2">carefully okay great so let&#39;s so how do</p>
<p begin="01:59:33.030" end="01:59:38.159" style="s2">we say hey let&#39;s just imagine that we</p>

<p begin="02:00:04.769" end="02:00:09.780" style="s2">content of that the answer is it we open</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.530" end="02:00:12.749" style="s2">source that but that&#39;s because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:00:12.749" end="02:00:16.979" style="s2">such thing which has protocols for group</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.849" end="02:00:20.429" style="s2">coherence there&#39;s more along the lines</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.979" end="02:00:25.079" style="s2">of remember it&#39;s we were trying to</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.429" end="02:00:29.969" style="s2">cultivate insight not teach so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.079" end="02:00:33.989" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to generate a in</p>

<p begin="02:00:58.559" end="02:01:01.980" style="s2">level but I want</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.140" end="02:01:03.330" style="s2">go back to something you said earlier</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.980" end="02:01:05.490" style="s2">because I think this ends up being quite</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.330" end="02:01:06.630" style="s2">a key you mentioned something that about</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.490" end="02:01:09.420" style="s2">the like the path of relationality</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.630" end="02:01:10.710" style="s2">doesn&#39;t scale but we&#39;re all for me with</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.420" end="02:01:12.360" style="s2">the addition of how a supersaturated</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.710" end="02:01:14.700" style="s2">solution does it phase transition to</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.360" end="02:01:17.430" style="s2">crystallization that I think is the</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.700" end="02:01:19.800" style="s2">answer if you actually do this thing</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.430" end="02:01:21.300" style="s2">where what your your field effect which</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.800" end="02:01:24.300" style="s2">is just say your open source broadcast</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.300" end="02:01:26.880" style="s2">is bringing more and more people into a</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.300" end="02:01:30.210" style="s2">poised state where their ability to move</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.880" end="02:01:32.070" style="s2">into coherence is becoming easier and</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.210" end="02:01:34.770" style="s2">easier and easier then when is up</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.070" end="02:01:36.090" style="s2">happening is that a small amount that</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.770" end="02:01:37.920" style="s2">actually does drop into coherence</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.090" end="02:01:39.320" style="s2">creates a crystallization phase</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.920" end="02:01:45.630" style="s2">transition that could actually scale</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.320" end="02:01:48.450" style="s2">extremely rapidly and has the</p>
<p begin="02:01:45.630" end="02:01:51.450" style="s2">characteristic of being very strong and</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.450" end="02:02:02.700" style="s2">very precise because it&#39;s starting on a</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.450" end="02:02:05.670" style="s2">basis that has no compromise yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.700" end="02:02:07.170" style="s2">I think we&#39;re actually I mean it depends</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.670" end="02:02:08.910" style="s2">on how we&#39;re defining coherence and what</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.170" end="02:02:12.210" style="s2">you&#39;re what you&#39;re perceiving as initial</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.910" end="02:02:14.280" style="s2">conditions okay and your question about</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.210" end="02:02:15.780" style="s2">states the state is basically because it</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.280" end="02:02:17.430" style="s2">feels like you&#39;re emphasizing a stage</p>
<p begin="02:02:15.780" end="02:02:18.990" style="s2">based argument which is that it&#39;s slow</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.430" end="02:02:21.750" style="s2">it&#39;s hard work and you have to really</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.990" end="02:02:24.510" style="s2">grow and develop into the person that</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.750" end="02:02:26.010" style="s2">can stay really hold coherence and I</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.510" end="02:02:28.260" style="s2">think what I find notice what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.010" end="02:02:30.420" style="s2">tracking I&#39;m like yeah absolutely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.260" end="02:02:33.210" style="s2">the foundational level the springboard</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.420" end="02:02:35.640" style="s2">from which you leap and obviously the</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.210" end="02:02:37.530" style="s2">higher that is the less hops you gotta</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.640" end="02:02:42.360" style="s2">have right to get to the level of</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.530" end="02:02:45.900" style="s2">coherence and between you know smart</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.360" end="02:02:48.780" style="s2">tech pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.900" end="02:02:51.180" style="s2">you know lineage practices like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.780" end="02:02:55.410" style="s2">enough out there these days that you can</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.180" end="02:02:57.690" style="s2">for sure create at least you know like</p>
<p begin="02:02:55.410" end="02:02:59.670" style="s2">the vomit comment you can create moments</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.690" end="02:03:04.740" style="s2">where everybody is weightless you can</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.670" end="02:03:06.630" style="s2">create a and a transient group coherence</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.740" end="02:03:10.110" style="s2">that and there&#39;s it&#39;s a bell curve</p>
<p begin="02:03:06.630" end="02:03:12.090" style="s2">distribution from what I can tell 10% of</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.110" end="02:03:13.530" style="s2">the people lose their don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.090" end="02:03:14.790" style="s2">what to do with that space or you know</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.530" end="02:03:17.580" style="s2">in maybe is life tenant could be more</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.790" end="02:03:19.410" style="s2">but likes to say tails you got you got</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.580" end="02:03:21.300" style="s2">the people who can&#39;t hang and lose their</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.410" end="02:03:25.080" style="s2"> and then you got the people it</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.300" end="02:03:27.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t budge at all and those are the</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.080" end="02:03:30.120" style="s2">psychopaths and they should not have</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.720" end="02:03:31.770" style="s2">been exposed to this and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.120" end="02:03:34.590" style="s2">the bell curve in the middle who are</p>
<p begin="02:03:31.770" end="02:03:37.140" style="s2">like oh wow you know the Omega principle</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.590" end="02:03:39.150" style="s2">like oh wow I&#39;m an organism I&#39;m in here</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.140" end="02:03:43.200" style="s2">I&#39;m an AI holy we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.150" end="02:03:48.060" style="s2">parallax this is joyful wondrous amazing</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.200" end="02:03:53.070" style="s2">and transformative and so what do we do</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.060" end="02:03:54.780" style="s2">with that I&#39;d like to enter topic we</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.070" end="02:04:00.150" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about yet which is the</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.780" end="02:04:05.760" style="s2">what Trust is to coherence it was</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.150" end="02:04:08.820" style="s2">mentioned earlier not defecting and so</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.760" end="02:04:15.330" style="s2">one model that I just used personally</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.820" end="02:04:18.090" style="s2">for trust is I trust people as much as I</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.330" end="02:04:19.380" style="s2">trust them in their worst states yeah</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.090" end="02:04:21.420" style="s2">because if there&#39;s a bell curve</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.380" end="02:04:24.380" style="s2">distribution on the states of behavior</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.420" end="02:04:26.820" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna go into maybe it which is</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.380" end="02:04:29.460" style="s2">for most people pretty coupled to their</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.820" end="02:04:30.960" style="s2">emotional states unfortunately right I</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.460" end="02:04:32.280" style="s2">want to uncouple those so that even if</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.960" end="02:04:33.780" style="s2">someone&#39;s in a shitty emotional state</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.280" end="02:04:36.720" style="s2">they don&#39;t behave shittily that they can</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.780" end="02:04:39.270" style="s2">witness it and not act on it right like</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.720" end="02:04:41.750" style="s2">I&#39;m in the fetal position right now no</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.270" end="02:04:44.760" style="s2">smashing and crashing things right and</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.750" end="02:04:46.320" style="s2">then I want to help what makes them go</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.760" end="02:04:48.300" style="s2">into the shittiest emotional states</p>
<p begin="02:04:46.320" end="02:04:50.580" style="s2">which is trauma and meaning making</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.300" end="02:04:52.290" style="s2">patterns I want to help heal that right</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.580" end="02:04:55.440" style="s2">so they don&#39;t go into as shitty States</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.290" end="02:04:57.690" style="s2">as often but then also decouple their</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.440" end="02:05:02.400" style="s2">internal state from their behavior but</p>
<p begin="02:04:57.690" end="02:05:04.500" style="s2">if if someone mmm sometimes takes</p>
<p begin="02:05:02.400" end="02:05:05.940" style="s2">information I share with them and uses</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.500" end="02:05:07.860" style="s2">it in really synergistic ways and</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.940" end="02:05:09.690" style="s2">generally it is at least discerning but</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.860" end="02:05:12.360" style="s2">when they&#39;re pissed off he uses it as a</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.690" end="02:05:14.880" style="s2">weapon against me but that happens</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.360" end="02:05:18.510" style="s2">well I can&#39;t share certain things with</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.880" end="02:05:20.970" style="s2">them right so there is raising the floor</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.510" end="02:05:22.830" style="s2">of the shittiest behavior you allow of</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.970" end="02:05:26.190" style="s2">yourself in relationship that makes you</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.830" end="02:05:28.750" style="s2">more trustworthy that is actually really</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.190" end="02:05:31.570" style="s2">at the heart of our ability to have an T</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.750" end="02:05:33.130" style="s2">coherence it says you know what no</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.570" end="02:05:34.330" style="s2">matter how upset with you I am there are</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.130" end="02:05:36.520" style="s2">certain up things I&#39;m just never</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.330" end="02:05:38.470" style="s2">going to do as my own standard for</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.520" end="02:05:40.360" style="s2">myself and then part of our discernment</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.470" end="02:05:42.310" style="s2">is to also be able to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.360" end="02:05:44.170" style="s2">where someone is not just in their</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.310" end="02:05:46.300" style="s2">highest states after the state induction</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.170" end="02:05:48.250" style="s2">methods you&#39;re talking about but where</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.300" end="02:05:49.810" style="s2">they are in the shitty parts and one of</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.250" end="02:05:52.810" style="s2">the things I&#39;m really interested in is</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.810" end="02:05:54.490" style="s2">not just making people&#39;s highest state&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.810" end="02:05:56.350" style="s2">higher well what brings them into their</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.490" end="02:05:58.540" style="s2">shitty estates is still anchored and now</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.350" end="02:06:00.640" style="s2">they they actually have a wider space to</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.540" end="02:06:03.160" style="s2">reconcile and they can even get bipolar</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.640" end="02:06:06.970" style="s2">about it it happens a lot yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.160" end="02:06:09.340" style="s2">help clean this stuff up for sure and</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.970" end="02:06:11.740" style="s2">it&#39;s recursive I was landing there as</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.340" end="02:06:15.160" style="s2">well I was thinking okay so state and</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.740" end="02:06:16.440" style="s2">stage obviously for me the first thing</p>
<p begin="02:06:15.160" end="02:06:20.170" style="s2">that comes up in terms of state is</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.440" end="02:06:21.730" style="s2">there&#39;s the constant recurrence of the</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.170" end="02:06:23.230" style="s2">trap of taking the state for the stage</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.730" end="02:06:24.880" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s carefully partition</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.230" end="02:06:26.290" style="s2">them and say okay they&#39;re not and to the</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.880" end="02:06:27.790" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;ve gone to burn him</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.290" end="02:06:30.640" style="s2">in and take taking drugs you are not in</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.790" end="02:06:31.900" style="s2">fact actually else anywhere but maybe</p>
<p begin="02:06:30.640" end="02:06:33.370" style="s2">you saw like a limp so there is</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.900" end="02:06:36.820" style="s2">somewhere else to go that&#39;s neat</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.370" end="02:06:39.640" style="s2">so very carefully so the first is big</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.820" end="02:06:42.540" style="s2">red flag state is not staged the state</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.640" end="02:06:45.280" style="s2">is not gonna get you to stage by itself</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.540" end="02:06:47.590" style="s2">take it slow okay so then what happens</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.280" end="02:06:50.770" style="s2">in state and as I was kind of just again</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.590" end="02:06:51.880" style="s2">some first-person experience well a lot</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.770" end="02:06:54.340" style="s2">of the stuff that we were talking about</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.880" end="02:06:56.860" style="s2">in terms of what given individual has to</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.340" end="02:06:59.410" style="s2">actually be able to come into to be able</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.860" end="02:07:02.170" style="s2">to start participating in a direct</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.410" end="02:07:04.260" style="s2">collaboration and getting to stage in my</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.170" end="02:07:07.300" style="s2">experience actually happened in States I</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.260" end="02:07:08.830" style="s2">you want to try to heal trauma trauma</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.300" end="02:07:11.890" style="s2">healing can happen very well with say</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.830" end="02:07:13.810" style="s2">psychedelics pair of transparent</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.890" end="02:07:15.190" style="s2">mannequin mind really really effectively</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.810" end="02:07:18.820" style="s2">supported by certain kinds of ecstatic</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.190" end="02:07:19.990" style="s2">states so there&#39;s a lot of things I</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.820" end="02:07:21.700" style="s2">think I think if you actually take the</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.990" end="02:07:23.970" style="s2">state and think of it as an instrument</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.700" end="02:07:27.310" style="s2">they can be pointed at particular</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.970" end="02:07:30.370" style="s2">capacities that can be moved into stage</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.310" end="02:07:31.540" style="s2">because or through the use of that so</p>
<p begin="02:07:30.370" end="02:07:33.190" style="s2">how do I use a particular state</p>

<p begin="02:07:38.200" end="02:07:42.610" style="s2">there then I think we&#39;re good then I</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.630" end="02:07:42.890" style="s2">think it works very nicely but we know</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.610" end="02:07:44.570" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.890" end="02:07:47.510" style="s2">Centaurus the Senators here we want to</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.570" end="02:07:48.560" style="s2">develop mature human beings and there</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.510" end="02:07:50.210" style="s2">are many many different state</p>

<p begin="02:07:50.210" end="02:07:53.780" style="s2">of doing that many of which we have to</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.400" end="02:07:55.820" style="s2">use now because our developmental</p>
<p begin="02:07:53.780" end="02:07:56.750" style="s2">environment so us up that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.820" end="02:08:01.070" style="s2">gonna have to do some pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.750" end="02:08:03.080" style="s2">tools to break stuff out yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.070" end="02:08:04.880" style="s2">I mean that would be my sense as well</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.080" end="02:08:09.320" style="s2">it&#39;s just that they are it is a</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.880" end="02:08:12.820" style="s2">beautiful thing that a peak state that</p>

<p begin="02:08:20.080" end="02:08:24.290" style="s2">deep thinking we see this with MDMA PTSD</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.970" end="02:08:25.910" style="s2">therapy and a bunch of other things but</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.290" end="02:08:28.190" style="s2">basically allows you to go back and</p>
<p begin="02:08:25.910" end="02:08:30.590" style="s2">reformat and reintegrate places that are</p>
<p begin="02:08:28.190" end="02:08:33.770" style="s2">currently wounded or traumatized and</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.590" end="02:08:38.000" style="s2">that we do that in relationship with</p>

<p begin="02:08:38.000" end="02:08:42.800" style="s2">then further creates the capacity for us</p>
<p begin="02:08:40.160" end="02:08:45.560" style="s2">to learn to play well with each other</p>
<p begin="02:08:42.800" end="02:08:47.450" style="s2">through all those stages which in a</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.560" end="02:08:49.130" style="s2">surface show if we can learn to share</p>
<p begin="02:08:47.450" end="02:08:53.620" style="s2">states well with each other and</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.130" end="02:08:58.010" style="s2">experience momentary coherence momentary</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.620" end="02:09:00.880" style="s2">transpersonal sense making and be in in</p>

<p begin="02:09:03.200" end="02:09:08.240" style="s2">the the linkage between those two is</p>
<p begin="02:09:05.300" end="02:09:10.580" style="s2">that communitas is like you know to me</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.240" end="02:09:12.440" style="s2">it feels like this you know nothing new</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.580" end="02:09:13.910" style="s2">Under the Sun kind of but like if</p>
<p begin="02:09:12.440" end="02:09:15.380" style="s2">you think of like gospel churches you</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.910" end="02:09:16.760" style="s2">know coming out of the African American</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.380" end="02:09:20.570" style="s2">slave experience it&#39;s like there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.760" end="02:09:22.940" style="s2">sense of they are perfectly designed you</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.570" end="02:09:25.400" style="s2">know vehicles for a lot of this which is</p>

<p begin="02:09:25.400" end="02:09:27.830" style="s2">guys seem like that the trailer for the</p>

<p begin="02:09:27.830" end="02:09:32.000" style="s2">Amazing Grace so it&#39;s like this she did</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.470" end="02:09:34.970" style="s2">this ripping album called Amazing Grace</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.000" end="02:09:36.440" style="s2">in a Watts Gospel Church in like 1974</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.970" end="02:09:38.030" style="s2">and then all the footage was lost and</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.440" end="02:09:39.740" style="s2">it&#39;s just come out like I literally wept</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.030" end="02:09:41.840" style="s2">seeing this this trailer was</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.740" end="02:09:44.480" style="s2">unreal and she starts singing the song</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.840" end="02:09:46.220" style="s2">Amazing Grace and she just takes that a</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.480" end="02:09:47.540" style="s2">and she just does there she goes all</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.220" end="02:09:50.570" style="s2">over the she&#39;s like 29 years old at the</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.540" end="02:09:52.400" style="s2">time and but but the Gospel Choir who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.570" end="02:09:53.660" style="s2">backing her up are like giving it up</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.400" end="02:09:55.160" style="s2">like they&#39;re feeling the shimmy shakes</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.660" end="02:09:56.660" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling the juice they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.160" end="02:09:57.229" style="s2">it up for and then they stop praising</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.660" end="02:09:59.300" style="s2">and testify</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.229" end="02:10:01.699" style="s2">like the whole thing just goes through</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.300" end="02:10:03.050" style="s2">the roof and you&#39;re like oh my god and</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.699" end="02:10:04.699" style="s2">then there&#39;s the swaying the clapping</p>
<p begin="02:10:03.050" end="02:10:08.150" style="s2">the dancing the moving and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:10:04.699" end="02:10:11.209" style="s2">it is weeping for the humanity of our</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.150" end="02:10:13.190" style="s2">wounding it is praising you know the</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.209" end="02:10:15.739" style="s2">divinity of our possibility and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.190" end="02:10:18.139" style="s2">connecting like literally like church as</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.739" end="02:10:21.019" style="s2">a vet and you&#39;re like ah man we got</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.139" end="02:10:23.989" style="s2">it you know we see the dust that</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.019" end="02:10:26.780" style="s2">off and like create new versions when</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.989" end="02:10:28.280" style="s2">you imagine the Gospel Church one of the</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.780" end="02:10:30.739" style="s2">things that makes it so powerful is that</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.280" end="02:10:33.889" style="s2">you&#39;re also noticing it is in continuity</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.739" end="02:10:36.260" style="s2">with a bigger context it&#39;s actually part</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.889" end="02:10:38.539" style="s2">of a real community yeah right and so</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.260" end="02:10:40.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you teleport to the Gospel</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.539" end="02:10:42.650" style="s2">Church and then you all fly back to your</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.190" end="02:10:44.929" style="s2">different cities you walk out and then</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.650" end="02:10:46.489" style="s2">you go live with each other and it</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.929" end="02:10:47.749" style="s2">contains the whole of humanity it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.489" end="02:10:49.670" style="s2">little kids and grandmas it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.749" end="02:10:52.429" style="s2">grandpas it&#39;s got the whole human family</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.670" end="02:10:55.510" style="s2">in a single place so it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.429" end="02:10:58.190" style="s2">heuristic if your state experience is</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.510" end="02:11:00.199" style="s2">you and a bunch of other 20-something</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.190" end="02:11:00.619" style="s2">rich white people it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.199" end="02:11:01.940" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.619" end="02:11:03.139" style="s2">something&#39;s probably off about that</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.940" end="02:11:04.420" style="s2">there&#39;s something going to be missing if</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.139" end="02:11:06.860" style="s2">it contains the whole of humanity</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.420" end="02:11:11.150" style="s2">turistic right not ideology heuristic</p>
<p begin="02:11:06.860" end="02:11:13.489" style="s2">this you know it&#39;s a and you know across</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.150" end="02:11:16.459" style="s2">different a whole community if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:13.489" end="02:11:19.280" style="s2">continuity if the group is spontaneously</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.459" end="02:11:20.840" style="s2">getting together in bali and then</p>
<p begin="02:11:19.280" end="02:11:21.769" style="s2">everybody&#39;s lying back to their West</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.840" end="02:11:25.219" style="s2">Coast East Coast</p>
<p begin="02:11:21.769" end="02:11:26.780" style="s2">flyover cities again probably not gonna</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.219" end="02:11:29.150" style="s2">get the thing done if on the other hand</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.780" end="02:11:31.190" style="s2">you&#39;re already living in community and</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.150" end="02:11:34.999" style="s2">the state experience is supporting a</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.190" end="02:11:37.159" style="s2">deeper communitas that is lived 24/7</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.999" end="02:11:39.199" style="s2">okay that&#39;s more likely to work so it</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.159" end="02:11:42.079" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re adding state stage in</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.199" end="02:11:44.420" style="s2">place enduring enduring continuity</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.079" end="02:11:46.820" style="s2">wholeness all right think of it think of</p>
<p begin="02:11:44.420" end="02:11:47.869" style="s2">it as part of a whole continuous process</p>
<p begin="02:11:46.820" end="02:11:49.010" style="s2">and then of course it happens if you get</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.869" end="02:11:51.739" style="s2">all kinds of interesting stuff because</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.010" end="02:11:53.329" style="s2">now you know one of the things as yours</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.739" end="02:11:54.800" style="s2">as particulars you&#39;re talking as like</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.329" end="02:11:56.630" style="s2">this really interesting thing like okay</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.800" end="02:11:58.159" style="s2">what are the failure conditions in the</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.630" end="02:12:00.079" style="s2">efforts to go here again like where does</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.159" end="02:12:01.429" style="s2">it fail and one of the ones was really</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.079" end="02:12:04.300" style="s2">interesting is like the difference</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.429" end="02:12:08.179" style="s2">between Michalek gluing together</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.300" end="02:12:09.709" style="s2">analytics and true synthesis so gluing</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.179" end="02:12:11.030" style="s2">together analytics is this thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.709" end="02:12:12.889" style="s2">like okay I&#39;ve got one piece</p>
<p begin="02:12:11.030" end="02:12:14.119" style="s2">paramedic of mine I&#39;ve got another</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.889" end="02:12:15.650" style="s2">pieces that I&#39;ve worked really really</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.119" end="02:12:19.489" style="s2">good in my yoga practice to be able to</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.650" end="02:12:20.840" style="s2">feel peaceful I got another piece where</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.489" end="02:12:22.099" style="s2">I&#39;ve taken a whole lot of drugs together</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.840" end="02:12:24.110" style="s2">with a bunch of people so we really feel</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.099" end="02:12:25.760" style="s2">close and we work some stuff out of over</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.110" end="02:12:27.289" style="s2">ayahuasca and then I&#39;m gonna do is kind</p>
<p begin="02:12:25.760" end="02:12:28.940" style="s2">of like put these in the same space and</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.289" end="02:12:30.619" style="s2">pretend that by sticking them together</p>
<p begin="02:12:28.940" end="02:12:32.630" style="s2">really hard I&#39;ve actually achieved some</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.619" end="02:12:33.770" style="s2">new synthesis right in fact what I have</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.630" end="02:12:35.780" style="s2">is I have three distinct things that</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.770" end="02:12:37.909" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually actually integrated so</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.780" end="02:12:40.969" style="s2">it&#39;s the difference between a puzzle and</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.909" end="02:12:43.429" style="s2">a photograph or even a puzzle and a real</p>
<p begin="02:12:40.969" end="02:12:45.650" style="s2">piece of reality and I think we&#39;re into</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.429" end="02:12:48.199" style="s2">this a lot it&#39;s almost like the group</p>
<p begin="02:12:45.650" end="02:12:50.360" style="s2">equivalent of spiritual bypass which is</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.199" end="02:12:51.710" style="s2">that we can arbitrarily generate a</p>
<p begin="02:12:50.360" end="02:12:54.289" style="s2">simulation of eating each of the</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.710" end="02:12:55.909" style="s2">artifacts of coherence and we can do so</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.289" end="02:12:56.809" style="s2">so consistently and so effective whether</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.909" end="02:12:58.969" style="s2">you really do think we&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.809" end="02:13:00.500" style="s2">achieved coherence like do you feel it</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.969" end="02:13:01.820" style="s2">yeah I feel it me do you have</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.500" end="02:13:03.949" style="s2">transparent mannheim got it no problem</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.820" end="02:13:05.809" style="s2">like every piece every piece that you</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.949" end="02:13:06.920" style="s2">can identify you can show and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.809" end="02:13:07.969" style="s2">not the whole thing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.920" end="02:13:09.860" style="s2">actually not integrated into a</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.969" end="02:13:11.329" style="s2">continuous wholeness so that I think is</p>
<p begin="02:13:09.860" end="02:13:13.219" style="s2">something to be very careful about is</p>

<p begin="02:19:07.679" end="02:19:10.830" style="s2">well I think the beauty of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.489" end="02:19:12.969" style="s2">happening though is that it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.830" end="02:19:14.469" style="s2">unlikely that anybody&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="02:19:12.969" end="02:19:15.939" style="s2">to watch this video because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:19:14.469" end="02:19:21.519" style="s2">incomprehensible and just hard to follow</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.939" end="02:19:23.139" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s extra not a problem the</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.519" end="02:19:26.279" style="s2">potential chance just kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.139" end="02:19:28.389" style="s2">about that in terms of like the meta is</p>
<p begin="02:19:26.279" end="02:19:30.159" style="s2">to degree to which this is actually</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.389" end="02:19:31.420" style="s2">interesting at all what I would say is</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.159" end="02:19:34.659" style="s2">that this is genuinely just a</p>
<p begin="02:19:31.420" end="02:19:36.460" style="s2">conversation this is I mean for those</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.659" end="02:19:38.349" style="s2">who happen to be watching this is</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.460" end="02:19:41.609" style="s2">straight-up just exactly what a</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.349" end="02:19:44.409" style="s2">conversation as up as that is</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.609" end="02:19:46.659" style="s2">what we talked about and this is no</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.409" end="02:19:47.830" style="s2">different as far as I can tell and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.659" end="02:19:49.569" style="s2">had conversations are both of you in</p>
<p begin="02:19:47.830" end="02:19:54.609" style="s2">some conversations the three of us</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.569" end="02:19:56.949" style="s2">together mean me a little bit more</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.609" end="02:19:58.810" style="s2">formal but not a lot I think was a</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.949" end="02:20:00.040" style="s2">slower start up like we cut it there was</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.810" end="02:20:02.890" style="s2">a little bit of that&#39;s right we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.040" end="02:20:05.350" style="s2">jump into it but this is more or less</p>
<p begin="02:20:02.890" end="02:20:08.170" style="s2">just water conversation with us is like</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.350" end="02:20:09.729" style="s2">so the your opponent thinks is quite</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.170" end="02:20:11.439" style="s2">quite nice okay cool so what do we do</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.729" end="02:20:15.100" style="s2">heuristic lis like how do we actually</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.439" end="02:20:16.930" style="s2">prevent this from creating unintended</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.100" end="02:20:18.279" style="s2">negative consequences so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.930" end="02:20:22.090" style="s2">something I wanted to enter in that I</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.279" end="02:20:23.590" style="s2">didn&#39;t yet and this was coming in it</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.090" end="02:20:25.359" style="s2">from a completely oblique direction of</p>
<p begin="02:20:23.590" end="02:20:27.489" style="s2">anything we&#39;ve talked about so far but</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.359" end="02:20:30.580" style="s2">it has to do with what the motive for us</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.489" end="02:20:32.229" style="s2">doing any of it is for doing any doing</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.580" end="02:20:35.470" style="s2">actually and so it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.229" end="02:20:39.760" style="s2">nature of desire and there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.470" end="02:20:42.760" style="s2">I find really fascinating if you look at</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.760" end="02:20:44.649" style="s2">the beginning of if you look at Buddha&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.760" end="02:20:49.989" style="s2">Noble Truths and desire as the source of</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.649" end="02:20:52.080" style="s2">all suffering and as kind of essential</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.989" end="02:20:55.510" style="s2">Eastern teaching and then you look at</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.080" end="02:20:58.359" style="s2">desire as the cause of passion and</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.510" end="02:21:00.939" style="s2">creativity in Western teaching there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.359" end="02:21:02.051" style="s2">really big dialectic between those</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.939" end="02:21:03.221" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of worth</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.051" end="02:21:06.671" style="s2">navigating and there&#39;s some deep</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.221" end="02:21:10.480" style="s2">ontology as to why and why I model those</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.671" end="02:21:11.891" style="s2">differences and so in a Western model</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.480" end="02:21:15.761" style="s2">made in the image and likeness of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.891" end="02:21:19.271" style="s2">Creator be creative and desire is the</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.761" end="02:21:20.940" style="s2">source of the imagined more beautiful</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.271" end="02:21:23.740" style="s2">rich future for us to be creative right</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.940" end="02:21:25.181" style="s2">Eastern model it has us disconnect from</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.740" end="02:21:27.641" style="s2">the fullness of the moment to imagine</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.181" end="02:21:29.141" style="s2">that a future moment could be more full</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.641" end="02:21:30.910" style="s2">and it actually makes us feverish and</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.141" end="02:21:32.471" style="s2"> up and then when we get it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.910" end="02:21:34.021" style="s2">only happy for like a moment and then we</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.471" end="02:21:36.790" style="s2">want something else</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.021" end="02:21:39.131" style="s2">Eastern model focused on being which</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.790" end="02:21:41.501" style="s2">happens in the moment Western model has</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.131" end="02:21:43.421" style="s2">a model of time that is reified focused</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.501" end="02:21:44.711" style="s2">on doing and becoming which is fulfilled</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.421" end="02:21:46.030" style="s2">in the future and so of course I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.711" end="02:21:47.681" style="s2">happy for a moment that I want something</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.030" end="02:21:50.771" style="s2">else because becoming is actually what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.681" end="02:21:53.830" style="s2">relevant becoming more and more full one</p>
<p begin="02:21:50.771" end="02:21:57.641" style="s2">way I think about this is if I think</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.830" end="02:22:00.311" style="s2">about desire as like voltage right like</p>
<p begin="02:21:57.641" end="02:22:04.391" style="s2">a pressure or a gradient for flow a</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.311" end="02:22:06.311" style="s2">basis for movement I can think about the</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.391" end="02:22:08.681" style="s2">low gradient inside of me in the high</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.311" end="02:22:10.391" style="s2">gradient in the world some some lack or</p>
<p begin="02:22:08.681" end="02:22:12.120" style="s2">emptiness and myself that creates a</p>
<p begin="02:22:10.391" end="02:22:15.580" style="s2">desire to get something from the world</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.120" end="02:22:21.120" style="s2">get recognition get money get sex get</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.580" end="02:22:24.700" style="s2">attention get something right and I</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.120" end="02:22:27.101" style="s2">think that Buddha was right to say that</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.700" end="02:22:30.370" style="s2">that is the cause of or at least related</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.101" end="02:22:33.040" style="s2">with suffering and it&#39;s kind of like to</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.370" end="02:22:36.011" style="s2">the degree that I am affirming a sense</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.040" end="02:22:37.711" style="s2">of self that is in lack I get more of</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.011" end="02:22:39.971" style="s2">that sense of self to those who have</p>
<p begin="02:22:37.711" end="02:22:41.320" style="s2">more shall be given to those who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.971" end="02:22:43.900" style="s2">have the little they have shall be taken</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.320" end="02:22:45.641" style="s2">away biblical quote but we&#39;re having is</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.900" end="02:22:48.551" style="s2">like a state of experience a state of</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.641" end="02:22:50.261" style="s2">consciousness so then there is a</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.551" end="02:22:52.870" style="s2">different kind of desire that is not</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.261" end="02:22:55.660" style="s2">just no orientation for movement which</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.870" end="02:22:58.870" style="s2">is an inner fullness that actually has a</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.660" end="02:23:00.580" style="s2">imperative to flow into the world so</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.870" end="02:23:02.320" style="s2">there is a desire and there&#39;s a basis</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.580" end="02:23:05.230" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually coming from wholeness</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.320" end="02:23:07.751" style="s2">not from unholiness is that marley bob</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.230" end="02:23:10.091" style="s2">marley like my cup overflows and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.751" end="02:23:13.091" style="s2">know what to do yeah a fez this poem</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.091" end="02:23:14.591" style="s2">i&#39;ve become this beggar has become so</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.091" end="02:23:15.609" style="s2">rich that my biggest problem that was</p>

<p begin="02:23:27.939" end="02:23:32.169" style="s2">in a meaningful place if I am coming</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.699" end="02:23:35.020" style="s2">from the other place and I need to be</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.169" end="02:23:36.310" style="s2">seen then I&#39;m going to cut you off to</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.020" end="02:23:37.779" style="s2">make sure that I get seen or make sure</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.310" end="02:23:40.600" style="s2">that my lick was the best or something</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.779" end="02:23:45.430" style="s2">like that and this is where the</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.600" end="02:23:47.979" style="s2">identities that are still seeking more</p>
<p begin="02:23:45.430" end="02:23:50.350" style="s2">and then can feel less in comparison to</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.979" end="02:23:52.439" style="s2">each other is the basis of rivalry that</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.350" end="02:23:54.760" style="s2">creates the fragility of the coherence</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.439" end="02:23:58.840" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah it&#39;s such an interesting</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.760" end="02:24:01.779" style="s2">thing like the yeah I agree with you</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.840" end="02:24:04.329" style="s2">that that teaching is what you say</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.779" end="02:24:05.919" style="s2">useful and works that there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.329" end="02:24:11.470" style="s2">actually recognize that you are capable</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.919" end="02:24:12.999" style="s2">of being full with simply itself there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.470" end="02:24:17.220" style="s2">no need to have something from the</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.999" end="02:24:19.749" style="s2">outside to fulfill but rather through</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.220" end="02:24:20.350" style="s2">doing something in self and then when</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.749" end="02:24:23.770" style="s2">you&#39;re in that place</p>
<p begin="02:24:20.350" end="02:24:25.060" style="s2">ah this is actually very similar to what</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.770" end="02:24:28.390" style="s2">you were talking about when you talked</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.060" end="02:24:30.489" style="s2">about the the least shitty to the most</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.390" end="02:24:33.609" style="s2">to the when there is a high low there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.489" end="02:24:39.189" style="s2">actually okay a way of developing self</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.609" end="02:24:41.260" style="s2">so as to be able to even when the</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.189" end="02:24:44.999" style="s2">interior the self is actually lacking in</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.260" end="02:24:47.109" style="s2">some way still to relate to that as full</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.999" end="02:24:49.359" style="s2">because the reality is is you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.109" end="02:24:52.919" style="s2">actually need that much very very little</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.359" end="02:24:55.239" style="s2">really minuscule amount really</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.919" end="02:24:58.329" style="s2">particularly in contemporary environment</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.239" end="02:24:59.470" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a disposition that can be</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.329" end="02:25:00.970" style="s2">achieved which is nice there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.470" end="02:25:03.249" style="s2">disposition that allows you to then be</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.970" end="02:25:06.489" style="s2">in a relationship where that gradient</p>
<p begin="02:25:03.249" end="02:25:08.379" style="s2">form desire is not have much traction it</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.489" end="02:25:11.560" style="s2">does not pull from me at least I can</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.379" end="02:25:15.100" style="s2">constantly feel it there&#39;s a pole but</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.560" end="02:25:16.239" style="s2">does not have much pull and I should</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.100" end="02:25:17.800" style="s2">mention by the way for me at least the</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.239" end="02:25:21.069" style="s2">training has also been having a noticing</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.800" end="02:25:22.869" style="s2">when it&#39;s going to build I&#39;m thirsty now</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.069" end="02:25:23.949" style="s2">okay well I better take care of that</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.869" end="02:25:27.520" style="s2">that actually is something that needs to</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.949" end="02:25:28.450" style="s2">be an actual conscious choice to satisfy</p>
<p begin="02:25:27.520" end="02:25:31.030" style="s2">I need now this is</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.450" end="02:25:33.580" style="s2">thing with your focus on sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.030" end="02:25:36.730" style="s2">starting at home that is so critical is</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.580" end="02:25:39.010" style="s2">because if I&#39;m not tending to my own</p>

<p begin="02:25:40.330" end="02:25:44.470" style="s2">exactly and then and then what happens</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.130" end="02:25:46.780" style="s2">is in my experiences that is that every</p>

<p begin="02:25:50.830" end="02:25:56.800" style="s2">right so my sense would be is that is</p>

<p begin="02:27:24.820" end="02:27:26.860" style="s2">gigging a:hover talks about that like</p>
<p begin="02:27:26.170" end="02:27:28.780" style="s2">well which is it</p>

<p begin="02:27:55.260" end="02:28:00.240" style="s2">practice and like even like a revival</p>
<p begin="02:27:57.090" end="02:28:02.010" style="s2">meditate collective Sabbath what is that</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.240" end="02:28:03.600" style="s2">tone the Bell yeah yeah I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.010" end="02:28:06.990" style="s2">overt I noticed it&#39;s such an odd thing</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.600" end="02:28:11.220" style="s2">for me is that I grew up in Texas in the</p>
<p begin="02:28:06.990" end="02:28:13.470" style="s2">70s so where prayer at mealtimes was</p>
<p begin="02:28:11.220" end="02:28:15.180" style="s2">actually very commonplace but my family</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.470" end="02:28:16.410" style="s2">didn&#39;t practice that so I had this</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.180" end="02:28:20.729" style="s2">experience of like what the heck is that</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.410" end="02:28:22.229" style="s2">and this was when move into secularism</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.729" end="02:28:24.000" style="s2">and even the New Atheism was becoming</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.229" end="02:28:25.229" style="s2">part of the cultural fabric so is what</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.000" end="02:28:27.270" style="s2">is that and also a little bit of like</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.229" end="02:28:30.390" style="s2">hmm that&#39;s not cool all right</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.270" end="02:28:31.440" style="s2">and as I got older that actually kind of</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.390" end="02:28:33.540" style="s2">disappeared but I&#39;ve actually noticed</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.440" end="02:28:35.250" style="s2">over the past what maybe from for years</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.540" end="02:28:37.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually going to build a prayer a</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.250" end="02:28:39.390" style="s2">mealtime practice myself but from the</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.560" end="02:28:41.700" style="s2">inside out meaning that it&#39;s not formal</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.390" end="02:28:43.410" style="s2">it&#39;s not imposed I&#39;m not like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.700" end="02:28:45.930" style="s2">reciting a script that I&#39;ve learned I</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.410" end="02:28:48.780" style="s2">haven&#39;t learned it rather I had an</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.930" end="02:28:51.360" style="s2">insight which was oh well there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:28:48.780" end="02:28:56.220" style="s2">of basic practices like feeling deep</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.360" end="02:28:59.400" style="s2">gratitude that are crucial and you</p>
<p begin="02:28:56.220" end="02:29:01.050" style="s2">always have to eat yeah so I would</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.400" end="02:29:03.060" style="s2">always forget to have my gratitude</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.050" end="02:29:04.860" style="s2">practice but when I said you know what</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.060" end="02:29:06.270" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do this before I eat I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.860" end="02:29:07.620" style="s2">do my gratitude practice I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="02:29:06.270" end="02:29:09.570" style="s2">bind something that just has this really</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.620" end="02:29:12.720" style="s2">cool characteristic of being really hard</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.570" end="02:29:15.360" style="s2">to forget i eating with something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.720" end="02:29:17.370" style="s2">really useful and has a little bit of</p>
<p begin="02:29:15.360" end="02:29:19.140" style="s2">cultural vector and just combine the two</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.370" end="02:29:20.490" style="s2">and then it just began to expand from</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.140" end="02:29:23.550" style="s2">there so this is of course the</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.490" end="02:29:25.290" style="s2">recreation of ritual that is also part</p>
<p begin="02:29:23.550" end="02:29:27.930" style="s2">of the story yeah and that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.290" end="02:29:30.560" style="s2">culture hacking we can do right I mean I</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.930" end="02:29:33.930" style="s2">mean no grace gratitude at dinner</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.560" end="02:29:36.270" style="s2">Shabbos you know Sabbath a day down a</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.930" end="02:29:38.790" style="s2">down day every week to reflect and reset</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.270" end="02:29:41.130" style="s2">like these are simple things that are</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.790" end="02:29:42.540" style="s2">easy to dust off and reanimate and I</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.130" end="02:29:44.370" style="s2">really think again I think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.540" end="02:29:46.080" style="s2">that can be open sourced we just have to</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.370" end="02:29:49.650" style="s2">make sure that we&#39;re not open sourcing</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.080" end="02:29:54.090" style="s2">the technology we&#39;re open sourcing the</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.650" end="02:29:57.110" style="s2">technology to bring into</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.090" end="02:29:59.850" style="s2">so don&#39;t open-source the info</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.110" end="02:30:02.370" style="s2">open-source things that build</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.850" end="02:30:05.550" style="s2">developmental capacity the generative</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.370" end="02:30:07.410" style="s2">process led Fanta so when you said you</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.550" end="02:30:09.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t come back to prayer because you</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.410" end="02:30:12.150" style="s2">were deciding to adopt the tradition but</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.840" end="02:30:14.150" style="s2">you discovered that that made sense</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.150" end="02:30:16.530" style="s2">yeah and earlier you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:30:14.150" end="02:30:20.340" style="s2">education that is not teaching info but</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.530" end="02:30:22.440" style="s2">that is facilitating Epiphany yeah when</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.340" end="02:30:23.760" style="s2">someone has real epiphany and they</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.440" end="02:30:25.140" style="s2">figure out something that&#39;s useful and</p>
<p begin="02:30:23.760" end="02:30:26.550" style="s2">then they teach other people and the</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.140" end="02:30:28.110" style="s2">other people don&#39;t understand why and</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.550" end="02:30:30.390" style="s2">that happens a few generations the</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.110" end="02:30:33.150" style="s2">Dharma becomes Dogma right like the</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.390" end="02:30:34.200" style="s2">thing that that had real wisdom just</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.150" end="02:30:36.630" style="s2">becomes a thing to do because the</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.200" end="02:30:37.980" style="s2">authorities told us and then liberation</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.630" end="02:30:40.260" style="s2">actually looks like rebelling against it</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.980" end="02:30:42.630" style="s2">and even if we&#39;re submitting to it we</p>
<p begin="02:30:40.260" end="02:30:44.580" style="s2">don&#39;t really get the gist and so to not</p>
<p begin="02:30:42.630" end="02:30:48.180" style="s2">have Dharma become dogma and become a</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.580" end="02:30:50.280" style="s2">control system it has to be alive and</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.180" end="02:30:52.080" style="s2">real and rediscovered for everyone and</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.280" end="02:30:53.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a different process than an</p>
<p begin="02:30:52.080" end="02:30:56.130" style="s2">emetic transmission exactly the medic</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.970" end="02:30:58.740" style="s2">transmission well what about a catalytic</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.130" end="02:31:00.090" style="s2">mimetic because that has to be no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.740" end="02:31:03.450" style="s2">lot of good syllables doesn&#39;t it sound</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.090" end="02:31:05.400" style="s2">like no truly I mean what would to your</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.450" end="02:31:09.180" style="s2">point about your you&#39;re giving your to</p>
<p begin="02:31:05.400" end="02:31:12.990" style="s2">your disclosing the protocols for self</p>
<p begin="02:31:09.180" end="02:31:15.271" style="s2">disclosure that that could arguably be a</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.990" end="02:31:17.250" style="s2">catalytic them principles more than</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.271" end="02:31:19.050" style="s2">protocols mmhmm yeah yeah yeah throw</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.250" end="02:31:23.610" style="s2">more I mean I&#39;m interested like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.050" end="02:31:25.320" style="s2">even a mythopoetic catalytic mimetic so</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.610" end="02:31:29.190" style="s2">what is the story of how we begin to</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.320" end="02:31:32.400" style="s2">remember and it&#39;s going to have to be</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.190" end="02:31:34.920" style="s2">again more in the direction of poetry or</p>
<p begin="02:31:32.400" end="02:31:38.430" style="s2">the parable of how we begin to remember</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.920" end="02:31:40.830" style="s2">yeah so that it&#39;s hinting to people in</p>
<p begin="02:31:38.430" end="02:31:44.250" style="s2">themselves moments in their lives but</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.830" end="02:31:45.930" style="s2">they have in fact come across stumbled</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.250" end="02:31:48.150" style="s2">across or opened into beginning to</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.930" end="02:31:49.920" style="s2">remember such that they can find in</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.150" end="02:31:51.061" style="s2">themselves the thread that is there is</p>

<p begin="02:31:51.061" end="02:31:58.200" style="s2">greater clarity mm-hmm yes and then I</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.790" end="02:31:59.370" style="s2">can testify by the fruits right and then</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.200" end="02:32:02.990" style="s2">we have to be very mindful of the fact</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.370" end="02:32:06.610" style="s2">that yeah this is what the 12th</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.990" end="02:32:10.370" style="s2">pun we&#39;ve kind of gone through the cycle</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.610" end="02:32:14.990" style="s2">on who&#39;s counting which we got the axial</p>
<p begin="02:32:10.370" end="02:32:16.880" style="s2">age we had the Christian Islamic era we</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.990" end="02:32:18.950" style="s2">had you know we have a series of points</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.880" end="02:32:20.990" style="s2">where there&#39;s like okay guys here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:32:18.950" end="02:32:22.850" style="s2">whole new level up you know somebody has</p>
<p begin="02:32:20.990" end="02:32:24.410" style="s2">an epiphany they have a real epiphany</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.850" end="02:32:26.450" style="s2">it&#39;s for real and they&#39;re like all right</p>
<p begin="02:32:24.410" end="02:32:30.110" style="s2">this time it&#39;s not turning to dog when</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.450" end="02:32:32.170" style="s2">guys let&#39;s get it right the trick of</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.110" end="02:32:34.970" style="s2">course here is that we kind of have to</p>
<p begin="02:32:32.170" end="02:32:36.350" style="s2">okay so this comes to what you were</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.970" end="02:32:39.680" style="s2">saying earlier that I wanted to comment</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.350" end="02:32:41.330" style="s2">on I&#39;m gonna say something that will</p>
<p begin="02:32:39.680" end="02:32:44.180" style="s2">sound like really inspiring or</p>
<p begin="02:32:41.330" end="02:32:49.040" style="s2">depression or ridiculous I&#39;ll go with</p>
<p begin="02:32:44.180" end="02:32:50.960" style="s2">ridiculous go so I&#39;m gonna speak</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.040" end="02:32:52.160" style="s2">mythopoetic Lee about the space that</p>
<p begin="02:32:50.960" end="02:32:56.810" style="s2">we&#39;re at and we&#39;ve talked about it like</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.160" end="02:32:58.880" style="s2">this before is that exponential tech the</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.810" end="02:33:02.390" style="s2">technology extends the power of our</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.880" end="02:33:03.800" style="s2">choice making and but are we have tools</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.390" end="02:33:04.970" style="s2">that give us the ability to make better</p>
<p begin="02:33:03.800" end="02:33:06.170" style="s2">tools that give us the ability make</p>
<p begin="02:33:04.970" end="02:33:07.910" style="s2">better tools so we have an exponential</p>
<p begin="02:33:06.170" end="02:33:09.560" style="s2">curve it&#39;s just been very slow and now</p>
<p begin="02:33:07.910" end="02:33:12.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not very slow now it&#39;s in the very</p>
<p begin="02:33:09.560" end="02:33:15.200" style="s2">quickly compounding place and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:33:12.680" end="02:33:17.150" style="s2">getting exponentially larger levers on</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.200" end="02:33:19.540" style="s2">our choices but we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="02:33:17.150" end="02:33:22.400" style="s2">exponentially better choice making and</p>
<p begin="02:33:19.540" end="02:33:24.500" style="s2">so we are getting the power of gods</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.400" end="02:33:26.450" style="s2">without getting the love or wisdom of</p>
<p begin="02:33:24.500" end="02:33:30.140" style="s2">gods to wield that power that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.450" end="02:33:32.210" style="s2">self-determination scenario I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:33:30.140" end="02:33:34.850" style="s2">any scenario where we don&#39;t get the</p>
<p begin="02:33:32.210" end="02:33:38.479" style="s2">power of gods that seems eminent and</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.850" end="02:33:40.310" style="s2">unavoidable and so they&#39;re really like</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.479" end="02:33:44.450" style="s2">there really is this enlightenment or</p>
<p begin="02:33:40.310" end="02:33:47.300" style="s2">bust thing that I see which is if we</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.450" end="02:33:49.280" style="s2">have catastrophic level tech not just</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.300" end="02:33:52.430" style="s2">isolated to state actors but they can be</p>
<p begin="02:33:49.280" end="02:33:57.080" style="s2">radically decentralized who gets to be</p>
<p begin="02:33:52.430" end="02:33:58.430" style="s2">totally up nobody or even not be</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.080" end="02:34:01.370" style="s2">very Omnicon sidered to can do</p>
<p begin="02:33:58.430" end="02:34:04.550" style="s2">catastrophic stuff on accident so this</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.370" end="02:34:06.740" style="s2">is like the existential Bodhisattva yes</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.550" end="02:34:08.810" style="s2">it is this is the Bodhisattva imperative</p>
<p begin="02:34:06.740" end="02:34:10.640" style="s2">actually has to become universal for us</p>
<p begin="02:34:08.810" end="02:34:12.290" style="s2">to make it through this phase and that</p>
<p begin="02:34:10.640" end="02:34:13.970" style="s2">wasn&#39;t true in the Bronze Age or Stone</p>
<p begin="02:34:12.290" end="02:34:15.800" style="s2">Age or Iron Age or any of the other ages</p>
<p begin="02:34:13.970" end="02:34:16.790" style="s2">because we could just kill a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:34:15.800" end="02:34:18.771" style="s2">people we could destroy</p>
<p begin="02:34:16.790" end="02:34:20.210" style="s2">environments and we did now it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:34:18.771" end="02:34:21.590" style="s2">kill everybody in all environment right</p>
<p begin="02:34:20.210" end="02:34:22.850" style="s2">so let&#39;s then jump back to the story I</p>
<p begin="02:34:21.590" end="02:34:26.000" style="s2">was trying to tell earlier quite poorly</p>
<p begin="02:34:22.850" end="02:34:28.160" style="s2">so zone of proximal development we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:34:26.000" end="02:34:30.920" style="s2">all got that notion right that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:34:28.160" end="02:34:33.470" style="s2">place we could get to now let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.920" end="02:34:36.890" style="s2">about them the level up from Homo</p>
<p begin="02:34:33.470" end="02:34:39.260" style="s2">habilis to homo sapiens and the many</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.890" end="02:34:41.930" style="s2">many different things that all had to</p>
<p begin="02:34:39.260" end="02:34:43.430" style="s2">come together simultaneously for that</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.930" end="02:34:46.521" style="s2">zone of proximal development to land</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.430" end="02:34:48.590" style="s2">right you had to have yet Yatta knee and</p>
<p begin="02:34:46.521" end="02:34:49.940" style="s2">grandmothers and fathers and the</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.590" end="02:34:52.550" style="s2">emergence of the capacity for language</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.940" end="02:34:53.780" style="s2">and a certain affinity to not beat the</p>
<p begin="02:34:52.550" end="02:34:55.010" style="s2"> out of other males as soon as you</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.780" end="02:34:58.400" style="s2">can count it like a whole bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="02:34:55.010" end="02:35:00.560" style="s2">each one of which independently isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:34:58.400" end="02:35:02.120" style="s2">necessary particularly useful and any</p>
<p begin="02:35:00.560" end="02:35:03.680" style="s2">one of which lacking it the thing</p>
<p begin="02:35:02.120" end="02:35:05.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold together very well right so</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.680" end="02:35:07.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a bunch of like little micro</p>
<p begin="02:35:05.600" end="02:35:08.150" style="s2">versions of it they don&#39;t that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.040" end="02:35:09.800" style="s2">work and they fall apart until</p>
<p begin="02:35:08.150" end="02:35:12.050" style="s2">eventually get to the zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="02:35:09.800" end="02:35:14.180" style="s2">development and then pop it kind of pops</p>
<p begin="02:35:12.050" end="02:35:16.430" style="s2">together I was thinking about that in</p>
<p begin="02:35:14.180" end="02:35:19.010" style="s2">terms of oK we&#39;ve we&#39;re in this place</p>
<p begin="02:35:16.430" end="02:35:19.160" style="s2">for alright we&#39;re making another run at</p>
<p begin="02:35:19.010" end="02:35:20.930" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="02:35:19.160" end="02:35:23.271" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get we&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.930" end="02:35:25.460" style="s2">to this spot and the question is well it</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.271" end="02:35:27.170" style="s2">was what are the pieces what are the</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.460" end="02:35:28.700" style="s2">pieces of the puzzle and I was really</p>
<p begin="02:35:27.170" end="02:35:29.900" style="s2">interested in like noticing that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:35:28.700" end="02:35:31.610" style="s2">got a whole bunch and they come from</p>
<p begin="02:35:29.900" end="02:35:33.980" style="s2">lots of different places you know you</p>
<p begin="02:35:31.610" end="02:35:36.620" style="s2">mentioned the Quakers and the Sioux and</p>
<p begin="02:35:33.980" end="02:35:37.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about like Buddhism has</p>
<p begin="02:35:36.620" end="02:35:39.890" style="s2">stuff like non-attachment</p>
<p begin="02:35:37.730" end="02:35:41.180" style="s2">like one of the interesting traps for</p>
<p begin="02:35:39.890" end="02:35:43.160" style="s2">example I was thinking through in terms</p>
<p begin="02:35:41.180" end="02:35:46.090" style="s2">of like okay if I had an epiphany and I</p>
<p begin="02:35:43.160" end="02:35:47.960" style="s2">want to share it and it turns to dogma</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.090" end="02:35:51.230" style="s2">one of the reasons is when it turns to</p>
<p begin="02:35:47.960" end="02:35:54.320" style="s2">dogma is attachment I want people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:35:51.230" end="02:35:56.150" style="s2">attached to the good work and so some</p>
<p begin="02:35:54.320" end="02:35:58.070" style="s2">interesting things about okay what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:35:56.150" end="02:36:02.660" style="s2">toolkit what are the pieces of this next</p>
<p begin="02:35:58.070" end="02:36:05.260" style="s2">stage that if they come together they</p>
<p begin="02:36:02.660" end="02:36:07.790" style="s2">mutually support each other like the</p>
<p begin="02:36:05.260" end="02:36:08.840" style="s2">that that when people stand in a circle</p>
<p begin="02:36:07.790" end="02:36:10.850" style="s2">they all kind of like turn and they</p>
<p begin="02:36:08.840" end="02:36:12.650" style="s2">begin to sit down simultaneously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:36:10.850" end="02:36:13.850" style="s2">just perfectly as you begin to lose your</p>
<p begin="02:36:12.650" end="02:36:14.810" style="s2">balance you sit and you land on somebody</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.850" end="02:36:16.750" style="s2">else&#39;s knees and it goes all the way</p>
<p begin="02:36:14.810" end="02:36:18.771" style="s2">around the whole circle like what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="02:36:16.750" end="02:36:20.480" style="s2">thing where all the pieces come together</p>
<p begin="02:36:18.771" end="02:36:21.830" style="s2">and the stage now has the elements that</p>
<p begin="02:36:20.480" end="02:36:25.390" style="s2">support each other so we actually have</p>
<p begin="02:36:21.830" end="02:36:25.390" style="s2">reached a new place</p>
<p begin="02:36:26.161" end="02:36:30.781" style="s2">and what I know this is this this really</p>
<p begin="02:36:28.201" end="02:36:31.650" style="s2">interesting thing where like if I apply</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.781" end="02:36:33.451" style="s2">non-attachment</p>
<p begin="02:36:31.650" end="02:36:35.190" style="s2">and humility by the way which are really</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.451" end="02:36:36.241" style="s2">interesting cross products if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:36:35.190" end="02:36:37.771" style="s2">coming from very different landed</p>
<p begin="02:36:36.241" end="02:36:39.480" style="s2">lineages and they reinforce each other</p>
<p begin="02:36:37.771" end="02:36:45.321" style="s2">quite nice so zooming in on attachment</p>
<p begin="02:36:39.480" end="02:36:48.511" style="s2">and humility in the context of urgency</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.321" end="02:36:51.751" style="s2">and in the context by the way of we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:36:48.511" end="02:36:53.761" style="s2">done a lot of conversations about the if</p>
<p begin="02:36:51.751" end="02:36:55.141" style="s2">you really really think clearly about</p>
<p begin="02:36:53.761" end="02:36:57.301" style="s2">the circumstances that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="02:36:55.141" end="02:36:59.911" style="s2">in even just the simple construction</p>
<p begin="02:36:57.301" end="02:37:02.221" style="s2">daniel did of as you&#39;re becoming more</p>
<p begin="02:36:59.911" end="02:37:03.361" style="s2">and more powerful as you become unlike</p>
<p begin="02:37:02.221" end="02:37:05.461" style="s2">and to god in the direction of</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.361" end="02:37:07.621" style="s2">destructive capacity if there&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="02:37:05.461" end="02:37:09.601" style="s2">equivalent like unto god then in level</p>
<p begin="02:37:07.621" end="02:37:13.771" style="s2">of wisdom and care you&#39;re likely going</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.601" end="02:37:15.211" style="s2">to things up real quick and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.771" end="02:37:17.161" style="s2">been through this many many times</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.211" end="02:37:19.230" style="s2">there&#39;s every construction you go</p>
<p begin="02:37:17.161" end="02:37:21.931" style="s2">through leads to the fact that we really</p>
<p begin="02:37:19.230" end="02:37:23.940" style="s2">don&#39;t have that much leeway we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.931" end="02:37:25.951" style="s2">have that much time and the number of</p>
<p begin="02:37:23.940" end="02:37:29.461" style="s2">paths that are not in fact catastrophic</p>
<p begin="02:37:25.951" end="02:37:32.400" style="s2">are extremely narrow okay well hold that</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.461" end="02:37:34.681" style="s2">that&#39;s true hold that hold the energy</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.400" end="02:37:36.690" style="s2">and the degree to which that creates a</p>
<p begin="02:37:34.681" end="02:37:40.351" style="s2">motivational push to cause you to just</p>
<p begin="02:37:36.690" end="02:37:43.311" style="s2">do stuff that is hard at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:37:40.351" end="02:37:45.631" style="s2">have both humility and non-attachment</p>
<p begin="02:37:43.311" end="02:37:47.611" style="s2">you know those the and committed at a</p>
<p begin="02:37:45.631" end="02:37:50.521" style="s2">level of intensity that&#39;s like way up</p>
<p begin="02:37:47.611" end="02:37:52.821" style="s2">there and not attached like that&#39;s the</p>
