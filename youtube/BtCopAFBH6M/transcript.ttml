<p begin="00:00:00.179" end="00:00:04.980" style="s2">hey everybody I&#39;m Josh with dowse Tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.730" end="00:00:06.420" style="s2">and I&#39;m here with Jordan green hall</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.980" end="00:00:09.450" style="s2">Jordan is a member of the Dow stack</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.420" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">advisory team as well as formerly</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.450" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">co-founder and CEO at DivX co-founder at</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:19.529" style="s2">mp3.com and Jordan is one of the leaders</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:21.510" style="s2">of the movement known as deep code which</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.529" end="00:00:23.460" style="s2">contemplates among other things some of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.510" end="00:00:25.470" style="s2">the great challenges facing humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.460" end="00:00:28.140" style="s2">what it will take to solve them through</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.470" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">the combined lens of a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.140" end="00:00:32.790" style="s2">disciplines you can read some adjourn s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">work on the medium publication deep code</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.790" end="00:00:39.480" style="s2">I particularly recommend the situational</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">assessment series so Jordan what are you</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.480" end="00:00:44.520" style="s2">observing in the ecosystem of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">that suggests a need for a project like</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.520" end="00:00:49.500" style="s2">Dow stack and how do you see - stacks</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">supporting the shifts that need to occur</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.500" end="00:00:54.899" style="s2">I think the first thing is to to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">caveat that there&#39;s many many different</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.899" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">things that are going on and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">them are interesting so what I&#39;m about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">to say is it necessarily the the only or</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">even the most interesting aspect but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s one that isn&#39;t common</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:12.420" style="s2">knowledge and I think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:14.460" style="s2">powerful concept that drives well you</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.420" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">know anybody who grasps it fully I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.460" end="00:01:18.869" style="s2">will have a meaningful upgrade and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:22.680" style="s2">ability to perceive what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.869" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">make good choices so the the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.680" end="00:01:30.659" style="s2">is that the the concept of rival rest&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:33.720" style="s2">an anti rival risks it&#39;s just call it</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.659" end="00:01:35.549" style="s2">economics so the concept is actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.720" end="00:01:37.530" style="s2">pretty simple and these days it&#39;s actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.549" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">pretty city grasps which is the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.530" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">rival risks consists of the production</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:44.579" style="s2">and distribution of things like like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">ham sandwich or a glass of water or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.579" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">barrel of oil</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">meaning the kinds of things where if I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">have it you don&#39;t have it and if I use</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:54.299" style="s2">it it&#39;s gone forever</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">meaning that we can be rivals over its</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.299" end="00:02:00.840" style="s2">possession and I think it&#39;s fair to say</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">that effectively all of economics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.840" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">all of the economy for effectively all</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:11.030" style="s2">of civilization has been driven by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.379" style="s2">question of how do we most effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.030" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">Purdue</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.379" end="00:02:23.159" style="s2">and most effectively distribute rival</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:24.269" style="s2">rose goods and the that kind of playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.159" end="00:02:25.739" style="s2">off between production and distribution</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.269" end="00:02:27.900" style="s2">I think in many ways could just</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.739" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">compactly describe the tensions between</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.900" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">various economic theories in the past</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:37.110" style="s2">are these political economic theories</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">and you know in the field of economics</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.110" end="00:02:41.250" style="s2">there&#39;s room for concept called the non</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.170" style="s2">rival risk which i think is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.250" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">pretty sloppy idea it&#39;s like a park or a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.170" end="00:02:47.900" style="s2">bus where many people can share it this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.129" style="s2">is shareable and those are interesting</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.900" end="00:02:51.629" style="s2">but I think if you really push him to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.129" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">the limit they collapse back down to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.629" end="00:02:55.950" style="s2">riders it&#39;s just larger groups of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:02:57.659" style="s2">are serrated with them but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.950" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">a completely different concept which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.659" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">the anti rival miss um and these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:05.099" style="s2">things that those of us who spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:08.790" style="s2">of time in the digital sphere or in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.099" end="00:03:10.349" style="s2">information sphere have intimate</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.790" end="00:03:15.019" style="s2">familiarity with these are things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.349" end="00:03:18.750" style="s2">say calculus or the English language or</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.019" end="00:03:21.510" style="s2">well both the idea and the active</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.750" end="00:03:24.120" style="s2">practice of the blockchain these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.510" end="00:03:26.549" style="s2">these are things where not only can I</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">have it and then also you have II</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.549" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">without me losing anything but more</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:32.700" style="s2">importantly actually it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:36.919" style="s2">valuable the more people who have it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.700" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">it&#39;s subject to almost inverse logics</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.919" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">almost inverse dynamics and as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:45.449" style="s2">out as a consequence also completely</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:46.889" style="s2">different economics the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.449" end="00:03:49.590" style="s2">economics even simple things like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.889" end="00:03:52.980" style="s2">law of supply and demand just flat-out</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.590" end="00:03:56.190" style="s2">don&#39;t apply and can&#39;t help make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.980" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">the anti robber is to make and so those</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.190" end="00:03:58.980" style="s2">are those are two fundamental concepts</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:03.389" style="s2">and then the next big piece of course is</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.980" end="00:04:05.129" style="s2">to recognize that we are moving into an</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.389" end="00:04:09.629" style="s2">environment where the ante to rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.129" end="00:04:14.099" style="s2">increasingly is dominant you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.629" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">out of a space where scarcity and rival</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.099" end="00:04:19.380" style="s2">hrus goods are affected everything you</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">have to care about and into a domain</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.380" end="00:04:24.430" style="s2">we&#39;re designing systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:27.160" style="s2">optimized for the generation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.430" end="00:04:29.979" style="s2">and throughout his phenomenal are what</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.160" end="00:04:33.130" style="s2">matters I mean we can tend to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.979" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">make it prosaic which is to say think</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.130" end="00:04:36.759" style="s2">about the way that technology has</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:38.680" style="s2">grasped and taking complete</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.759" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">responsibility for or is in the process</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.680" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">of taking responsibility for say food</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:45.669" style="s2">production if we move into the zone of</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:49.210" style="s2">vertical indoor farming and cultured</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.669" end="00:04:50.830" style="s2">meats like imagine in ten years 85% of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.210" end="00:04:54.729" style="s2">all food is actually produced by those</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.830" end="00:04:56.740" style="s2">kinds of modes that takes a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.729" end="00:04:58.900" style="s2">rival roars phenomena on food almost in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.740" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">some sense the archetype and shows how</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.900" end="00:05:04.150" style="s2">it has become the object and consequence</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:04.510" style="s2">the answer is rather than the other way</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.150" end="00:05:10.870" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.510" end="00:05:13.870" style="s2">mmm-hmm so so so the DAO as a concept in</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.870" end="00:05:15.789" style="s2">many ways takes place in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.870" end="00:05:18.370" style="s2">the necessity for the invention</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.789" end="00:05:20.349" style="s2">development of a truly anti ravenous</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.370" end="00:05:24.099" style="s2">economic system but if at a conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.349" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">level and at a physical level and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.099" end="00:05:27.340" style="s2">while it is it&#39;s certainly the case and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.229" style="s2">I and I completely endorse notions and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.340" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">thinking about and by the way even spent</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.229" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">a long time thinking about notions about</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:35.830" style="s2">how the DAO revolutionizes methods of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:39.460" style="s2">organization and does things like</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.830" end="00:05:42.159" style="s2">reduces transaction costs I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.460" end="00:05:44.740" style="s2">actually more interesting more profound</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.159" end="00:05:46.510" style="s2">more powerful to think about how the Dow</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.740" end="00:05:49.300" style="s2">steps into the space of the anti</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.510" end="00:05:54.610" style="s2">rivalries yep and what does that mean so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:56.530" style="s2">so then to kind of examine that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.610" end="00:05:59.880" style="s2">take a look at the problem of open</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.530" end="00:06:02.830" style="s2">source and open source is I actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.880" end="00:06:06.669" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m that&#39;s the right way of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.830" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">putting it it&#39;s an early stage of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.669" end="00:06:10.599" style="s2">evolution it&#39;s a recognition of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:13.770" style="s2">that there&#39;s something incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.599" end="00:06:17.680" style="s2">powerful about the ability to create</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.770" end="00:06:19.990" style="s2">things that are more valuable the more</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.680" end="00:06:22.120" style="s2">share they are and therefore we should</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.990" end="00:06:23.889" style="s2">design them to be more shared and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.120" end="00:06:26.409" style="s2">should open the source and make it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.889" end="00:06:29.080" style="s2">that anybody who wants to use them can</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.409" end="00:06:30.610" style="s2">and equivalently anybody who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.080" end="00:06:34.750" style="s2">add Gaia to them can because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.610" end="00:06:36.219" style="s2">multiplicative factor is enormous but of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.750" end="00:06:37.950" style="s2">course what open source lacks is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.219" end="00:06:41.580" style="s2">mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.950" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">two distinct things one is rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.580" end="00:06:46.110" style="s2">people you were doing that in any way</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:47.430" style="s2">other than intrinsic which is great I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.110" end="00:06:49.710" style="s2">mean there could be wrong the open</p>

<p begin="00:06:49.710" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">of good but it in many ways reached its</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.920" end="00:06:57.240" style="s2">limitations there are things that it has</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:58.410" style="s2">not been able to do yeah and a part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.240" end="00:07:00.330" style="s2">why it hasn&#39;t been able to do them is</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.410" end="00:07:03.600" style="s2">because you can&#39;t make a meaningful</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.760" end="00:07:20.340" style="s2">and this is solving this problem is one</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.290" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">it turns out the other major problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.140" end="00:07:36.920" style="s2">happens to be so the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:40.590" style="s2">same coin which is how do we go about</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.920" end="00:07:42.510" style="s2">orienting ourselves towards the highest</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:45.420" style="s2">kind of value that we could contribute</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.510" end="00:07:47.430" style="s2">into this anti reverse domain if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.420" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">think about old-fashioned microeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.430" end="00:07:54.060" style="s2">its just supply and demand which shows</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:55.740" style="s2">up this price meaning if I have skills</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.060" end="00:07:57.330" style="s2">at growing food and I have skills at</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:02.550" style="s2">for me to find out which of those I</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.500" end="00:08:05.610" style="s2">should do is to find out which one will</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.550" end="00:08:08.580" style="s2">pay me the most mm-hmm and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.610" end="00:08:13.140" style="s2">kind of the brilliance of the price</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.580" end="00:08:15.720" style="s2">equation in a market economy yes all I</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.140" end="00:08:17.880" style="s2">have to do is keep my eyes open through</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.720" end="00:08:19.740" style="s2">what is paying me the most and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.880" end="00:08:23.700" style="s2">what is in fact the most valuable way</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.740" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">that I can contribute to the Commons but</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.700" end="00:08:27.960" style="s2">in the and what we try to do is you try</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:29.730" style="s2">to kind of shoehorn the anti rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.960" end="00:08:33.180" style="s2">into that environment by inventing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.730" end="00:08:35.780" style="s2">intellectual property so if I can take</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.180" end="00:08:39.300" style="s2">the output of my anti reverse Goods</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.780" end="00:08:40.710" style="s2">ideas and I can put a fence around them</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.300" end="00:08:43.290" style="s2">and say okay now these are now rival</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.710" end="00:08:47.790" style="s2">risks you can kind of make them a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.290" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">bit work using supply and demand but of</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.790" end="00:08:51.210" style="s2">course the whole point is that with</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:51.870" style="s2">patents and trademarks and copyrights a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.210" end="00:08:52.980" style="s2">limit</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.870" end="00:08:54.870" style="s2">abilities what they actually do is they</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.980" end="00:08:58.500" style="s2">limit the global value that could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.870" end="00:09:00.600" style="s2">produced and if you if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.500" end="00:09:02.339" style="s2">the way that it&#39;s not just a one-time</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.600" end="00:09:04.500" style="s2">meaning lots of people can benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.339" end="00:09:07.050" style="s2">the sharing but it&#39;s also the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.500" end="00:09:08.810" style="s2">the curve because the antivirus has this</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.050" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">building on the shoulders of giants</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.810" end="00:09:13.890" style="s2">somebody invents calculus not only is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">great that everybody gets calculus but</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.890" end="00:09:17.490" style="s2">it&#39;s also the fact that nobody else has</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">to ever do it again right the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.490" end="00:09:20.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to reinvent caucus the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:22.020" style="s2">genius gets to build what&#39;s on top of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.400" end="00:09:25.800" style="s2">calculus and continue continue continue</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.020" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">so if you if you if you rate limit the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.800" end="00:09:31.350" style="s2">dissemination of antivirus phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">not only do you - do you limit the value</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.350" end="00:09:35.880" style="s2">of their dissemination on one level but</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:38.339" style="s2">more importantly you actually change the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.880" end="00:09:39.779" style="s2">slope of the curve of what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.339" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">people get this ramify effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.779" end="00:09:41.640" style="s2">building on the shoulders of giants</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:43.740" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.640" end="00:09:46.890" style="s2">and so if you if you go if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.740" end="00:09:48.930" style="s2">basically run the math on that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.890" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">patent style system which is to say the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.930" end="00:09:54.300" style="s2">rival risk approach to an travelers</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.540" end="00:10:00.089" style="s2">phenomena is extraordinarily in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.300" end="00:10:05.490" style="s2">operation and also effectively hobbles</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.089" end="00:10:07.080" style="s2">or destroys the actual generative</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.490" end="00:10:10.200" style="s2">capacity of those economies that operate</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.080" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">in that fashion and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.200" end="00:10:14.070" style="s2">is actually very important with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:15.990" style="s2">what that means is that anybody or more</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.070" end="00:10:17.820" style="s2">specifically the first group the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.990" end="00:10:21.720" style="s2">economy of any meaningful size that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.820" end="00:10:24.360" style="s2">figures out how to actually fully orient</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.360" end="00:10:29.010" style="s2">anti reverse contributions and then to</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.910" end="00:10:33.150" style="s2">motivate them by fully incentivizing</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.010" end="00:10:38.209" style="s2">them has a decisive strategic advantage</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.150" end="00:10:42.120" style="s2">over all rival risk economies mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.209" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">okay yeah this is it&#39;s a one-way trip it</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.120" end="00:10:47.820" style="s2">is the the metaphorical equivalent of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:50.370" style="s2">learning of Homo sapiens learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.820" end="00:10:53.370" style="s2">speak versus other primates it is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.370" end="00:10:57.209" style="s2">level of dissemination it is a escape</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.370" end="00:10:59.130" style="s2">velocity shift yes it is both a hard</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.209" end="00:11:01.740" style="s2">part as a novel problem it is a hard</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.130" end="00:11:03.630" style="s2">problem and it is a good problem if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.740" end="00:11:05.060" style="s2">solve that problem you have in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.630" end="00:11:08.150" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.060" end="00:11:09.890" style="s2">the entirety of the of the rivals game</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.150" end="00:11:12.080" style="s2">the game that civilization had been</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.890" end="00:11:13.700" style="s2">playing for the past 10,000 years you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.080" end="00:11:16.250" style="s2">get to win that game and then you get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.700" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">play in a completely new game and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.250" end="00:11:20.180" style="s2">because of the velocity the shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:22.490" style="s2">curve that happens we&#39;ve begun to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.180" end="00:11:24.680" style="s2">resolve the antivirus questions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.490" end="00:11:26.420" style="s2">again it&#39;s the question of where should</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.680" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">I is the potential contributor to the</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.300" end="00:11:44.180" style="s2">reward me for doing that so that I am</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.830" end="00:11:47.420" style="s2">fully and appropriately incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.180" end="00:11:49.850" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem the acceleration of</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.420" end="00:11:51.320" style="s2">that problem is what moves us into what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.850" end="00:11:54.200" style="s2">many people call the society of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.320" end="00:11:56.810" style="s2">abundance it moves us into I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.200" end="00:12:00.680" style="s2">former the best statement so far is from</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.810" end="00:12:02.330" style="s2">the book mana we talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.680" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">Australia project the Australia project</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.330" end="00:12:11.480" style="s2">is exactly this or at least it&#39;s close</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.790" end="00:12:13.340" style="s2">enough to account so we so we can come</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.480" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">to recapitulate we have we have the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.340" end="00:12:17.870" style="s2">problem that we can&#39;t actually use</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.740" end="00:12:20.660" style="s2">supply and demand in the price equation</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.870" end="00:12:23.570" style="s2">either to orient people&#39;s attention or</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.660" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">to reward their contributions in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.570" end="00:12:28.730" style="s2">antivirus domain I can spend time kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:30.920" style="s2">of decomposing that but in this context</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.730" end="00:12:34.040" style="s2">the middle is just accept that as being</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.920" end="00:12:35.510" style="s2">a and insight um and if we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:37.250" style="s2">out how to solve that problem in</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.510" end="00:12:39.530" style="s2">appropriate that you the imprint drivers</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.250" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">domain we&#39;ve done something that is just</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.530" end="00:12:45.230" style="s2">flat-out more than a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:47.870" style="s2">it is qualitative shift in a group</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.230" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">capacity so this that becomes the object</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:55.280" style="s2">is also actually object that are tried</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.270" end="00:12:57.530" style="s2">to baton to this space and and the</p>

<p begin="00:13:26.040" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">very interesting actually because when I</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.529" end="00:14:08.279" style="s2">practice they&#39;re glued together in such</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.450" end="00:14:10.769" style="s2">an intimate way that while one can and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.279" end="00:14:13.860" style="s2">should think about say the design aspect</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.769" end="00:14:17.060" style="s2">of practice and the coding aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.860" end="00:14:18.870" style="s2">theories so I inverted them on purpose</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.060" end="00:14:19.290" style="s2">that&#39;s the better way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.870" end="00:14:21.899" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.290" end="00:14:24.500" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s kind of like the way in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.899" end="00:14:28.140" style="s2">scientific in the scientific endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.500" end="00:14:29.760" style="s2">theory and experiment can be separated</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.140" end="00:14:33.660" style="s2">but was only doing science when one is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.760" end="00:14:35.579" style="s2">doing both in a very intimate way in in</p>

<p begin="00:14:35.579" end="00:14:40.440" style="s2">and all problems of this sort other</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.380" end="00:14:43.700" style="s2">weathers end as many one must</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.440" end="00:14:45.480" style="s2">simultaneously be doing writing code in</p>

<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:14:58.829" style="s2">that I think is what makes Dow stack</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.760" end="00:15:00.329" style="s2">interesting is that they I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.829" end="00:15:02.940" style="s2">intuitively get that but more</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.329" end="00:15:05.699" style="s2">importantly have the capacity to do it</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.940" end="00:15:08.520" style="s2">you know and this is very different than</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.699" end="00:15:11.220" style="s2">a lot of the the native ways that one</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.520" end="00:15:15.019" style="s2">goes about doing software development in</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.019" end="00:15:19.320" style="s2">for very good reasons by the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.980" end="00:15:26.060" style="s2">software development in the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.320" end="00:15:26.060" style="s2">has taken a very incremental and low</p>

<p begin="00:15:30.360" end="00:15:35.190" style="s2">ability to simply change the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.040" end="00:15:38.069" style="s2">rapidly has become a good design</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.190" end="00:15:39.029" style="s2">methodology and in many cases that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.069" end="00:15:41.550" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.029" end="00:15:44.040" style="s2">but as certain cases it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.550" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">capable of solving the problem and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.040" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">think we have a nice simple</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:54.509" style="s2">example which was the the transition to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:56.670" style="s2">aetherium at the moment of the inception</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.509" end="00:16:02.699" style="s2">of ethereum so yes if you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.670" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">history of the blockchain version 1 the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.699" end="00:16:05.490" style="s2">Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:09.029" style="s2">invention and if you think about Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.490" end="00:16:13.589" style="s2">bitcoin is an example of a genius level</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.029" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">of focus on total system design it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.589" end="00:16:17.910" style="s2">able to be instantiated in a white paper</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:20.639" style="s2">which all at once articulated a</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.639" end="00:16:24.019" style="s2">all the necessary elements like really</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.019" end="00:16:29.220" style="s2">and also thinking about the intrinsic</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.220" end="00:16:35.189" style="s2">would drive behaviors around miners and</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.339" end="00:16:37.050" style="s2">around consensus kind of all had to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.189" end="00:16:39.709" style="s2">done at once if you didn&#39;t get it all at</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.050" end="00:16:41.579" style="s2">once you weren&#39;t going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.709" end="00:16:43.709" style="s2">discover it through local</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.579" end="00:16:45.029" style="s2">experimentation but once you did the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.709" end="00:16:46.920" style="s2">design work you then began the hard</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.029" end="00:16:48.630" style="s2">problem of implementation and then now</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.920" end="00:16:49.949" style="s2">we&#39;re in the middle of the lift vital</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.630" end="00:16:51.509" style="s2">experiment where we discover all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.949" end="00:16:54.930" style="s2">of problems that do actually have to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.509" end="00:16:57.089" style="s2">solved hands on with I take a lightning</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.930" end="00:17:00.389" style="s2">network being the canonical example of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.089" end="00:17:02.790" style="s2">that yeah then what happens though as</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.389" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">you explore the space of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.790" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">that opens up within the domain of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">Bitcoin approach what you see at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:17.699" style="s2">edge of that space is a path that is</p>

<p begin="00:17:17.699" end="00:17:21.809" style="s2">those remember the history there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.809" end="00:17:23.909" style="s2">actually that what ended up happening at</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.809" end="00:17:25.530" style="s2">different alt coins who began trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.909" end="00:17:28.679" style="s2">explore the space that possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.530" end="00:17:31.230" style="s2">lipid is the design capacity of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:31.230" end="00:17:37.830" style="s2">against the edge of Turing completeness</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.290" end="00:17:40.170" style="s2">which was well we kind of need to step</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.830" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">back and do a comprehensive redesign</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.170" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">we need to actually re-enter the space</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:47.790" style="s2">of pure architecture and think about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:50.070" style="s2">problem in its purest sense you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.790" end="00:17:51.900" style="s2">really move into again into a design</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.070" end="00:17:54.090" style="s2">space and and think about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.900" end="00:17:55.320" style="s2">thing all at once think about all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.090" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">different parameters all the different</p>

<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:19.049" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get to it aetherium is a merely</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.120" end="00:18:20.730" style="s2">progressing organically from Bitcoin you</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.049" end="00:18:21.690" style="s2">actually had to take Bitcoin as a as a</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.690" end="00:18:27.750" style="s2">stepping back rethink the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.260" end="00:18:28.679" style="s2">launch a new design approach and bam so</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.750" end="00:18:31.910" style="s2">you kind of have these trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.679" end="00:18:34.320" style="s2">between McMichael high design and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.910" end="00:18:38.360" style="s2">organic development mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.320" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">and the Dow is of that same order</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.360" end="00:18:42.090" style="s2">obvious the beginning part of this video</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.980" style="s2">talked about fundamental theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.090" end="00:18:46.500" style="s2">problem but it&#39;s many many different</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:49.350" style="s2">things of driving that that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.500" end="00:18:51.660" style="s2">get to the Dow through organic</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.350" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">development on top of the etherium</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.660" end="00:18:56.610" style="s2">platform you could do some interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:19:00.030" style="s2">things you can build ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.610" end="00:19:03.419" style="s2">governance you can build ways of having</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.030" end="00:19:06.090" style="s2">collaborative economies but the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.419" end="00:19:08.070" style="s2">problem space is actually more</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.090" end="00:19:11.549" style="s2">fundamental than that and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.070" end="00:19:13.230" style="s2">necessary to step back radically expand</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.549" end="00:19:16.220" style="s2">the scope of considerations think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.230" end="00:19:19.020" style="s2">the entire systems design as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.220" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">really do design in the way the design</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.020" end="00:19:24.620" style="s2">is supposed to be done and then once</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:27.150" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually really gotten down to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.620" end="00:19:28.679" style="s2">you make all conceptual clarity what are</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.150" end="00:19:30.809" style="s2">the really important pieces what are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.679" end="00:19:32.880" style="s2">fundamental elements that must be in</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.809" end="00:19:35.160" style="s2">place in the right way and how they</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.880" end="00:19:37.290" style="s2">feedback and relate to each other then</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.160" end="00:19:41.490" style="s2">you instantiate it as a technical</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.290" end="00:19:43.230" style="s2">architecture as a protocol and then once</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.490" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that you get you move back</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.230" end="00:19:48.840" style="s2">into the space of organic development</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:51.390" style="s2">mm-hm and then you&#39;re then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.840" end="00:19:53.880" style="s2">running right if you&#39;ve got it right</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.390" end="00:19:57.270" style="s2">he&#39;s entered into a new space which</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.880" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">is equivalent to these kind of major</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.270" end="00:20:06.620" style="s2">tones Bitcoin etherium so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:11.130" style="s2">the frame there&#39;s a kind of approach and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.620" end="00:20:13.680" style="s2">a style and a capacity for design</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.130" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">thinking and four fundamental thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.680" end="00:20:19.920" style="s2">and I think thinking in a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:26.120" style="s2">fashion that is I believe necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.920" end="00:20:30.680" style="s2">truly grasp the question of the Dow and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.120" end="00:20:35.670" style="s2">it is only when that has been done</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.680" end="00:20:39.560" style="s2">appropriately and then instantiated that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.670" end="00:20:42.180" style="s2">we have moved into this new era and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.560" end="00:20:44.430" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s kind of the way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.180" end="00:20:45.780" style="s2">understand it the if you try if you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.430" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">to understand what&#39;s going on in the Dow</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.780" end="00:20:51.810" style="s2">space this conceptual distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">between high design and organic</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.810" end="00:20:56.840" style="s2">development I think is helpful to make</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">sense of it yeah if you draw the analogy</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.930" end="00:21:15.060" style="s2">innovation of its cerium I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:16.980" style="s2">analogy if that makes sense to you then</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.060" end="00:21:20.220" style="s2">I think you&#39;re in a good in good shape</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.980" end="00:21:21.480" style="s2">to navigate this space if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.220" end="00:21:22.980" style="s2">make sense to you then hopefully you</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.480" end="00:21:24.180" style="s2">have other ways of making sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.980" end="00:21:27.540" style="s2">want to jump into this space because</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.180" end="00:21:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not at all trivial yeah it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.540" end="00:21:31.980" style="s2">like in your view the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.880" end="00:21:34.950" style="s2">decentralized collaboration represents</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.980" end="00:21:36.180" style="s2">the third major movement in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.950" end="00:21:37.560" style="s2">evolution of blockchain yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.180" end="00:21:39.090" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the right way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.560" end="00:21:41.430" style="s2">about it you can think about these as</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.090" end="00:21:43.290" style="s2">major and minor tones or major and minor</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.430" end="00:21:44.970" style="s2">movements and this is a major movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.290" end="00:21:47.010" style="s2">and it would be the third major movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.970" end="00:21:48.840" style="s2">and I have to admit that from an</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:54.510" style="s2">aesthetic perspective I can&#39;t prove this</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.840" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">no what I even try but intuitively this</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.510" end="00:21:59.730" style="s2">may in fact be the reason now if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:01.950" style="s2">think about the the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.730" end="00:22:03.150" style="s2">consequence you have what I described is</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.950" end="00:22:05.220" style="s2">what happens when you really figure out</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.150" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">how to build an anti rivals economic</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.220" end="00:22:07.370" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.730" end="00:22:13.619" style="s2">if we say 400 years in the future we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.859" end="00:22:15.419" style="s2">look back at this story if it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.619" end="00:22:18.419" style="s2">that we had cracked the code on anti</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.419" end="00:22:20.119" style="s2">robberies then that will have been why</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.419" end="00:22:23.539" style="s2">we did all of this in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.119" end="00:22:26.070" style="s2">mm-hmm and requires a completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.539" end="00:22:28.200" style="s2">bottom-up approach integrated with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.070" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">high-level design yes and in fact what I</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:33.649" style="s2">would say is that the if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">the essence of what design means really</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.649" end="00:22:39.570" style="s2">design means simultaneously something</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">that is fully bottoms up and fully</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.570" end="00:22:44.279" style="s2">talked out yeah you have to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.570" end="00:22:46.289" style="s2">able to grasp both simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.279" end="00:22:47.639" style="s2">understand the synergistic consequences</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.289" end="00:22:50.549" style="s2">of relating them appropriately and</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.639" end="00:22:53.509" style="s2">sounds like for you one of the geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.549" end="00:22:56.220" style="s2">of Dow stack is the attention to and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.509" end="00:22:58.470" style="s2">facility in both bottom-up and top-down</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.220" end="00:23:00.539" style="s2">approaches to architecture and design</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.470" end="00:23:05.309" style="s2">yes the kinds of people who have been</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.539" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">gathered around it have that capability</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.309" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">and also have that consciousness meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.389" style="s2">that they are not just doing it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:16.559" style="s2">they&#39;re aware of the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.389" end="00:23:19.230" style="s2">doing it and in many ways why mmhmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.559" end="00:23:20.639" style="s2">although they are continuing to struggle</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.230" end="00:23:26.100" style="s2">to figure out how to articulate it which</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.639" end="00:23:28.859" style="s2">is not not surprising it&#39;s hard it&#39;s new</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.100" end="00:23:30.809" style="s2">territory yeah yeah anything else you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.859" end="00:23:33.330" style="s2">want to mention while we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.809" end="00:23:34.919" style="s2">about the contribution that Dow stock</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.330" end="00:23:37.649" style="s2">might be able to make within the greater</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.919" end="00:23:41.009" style="s2">Dowie ecosystem I could kind of hold out</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.649" end="00:23:45.419" style="s2">specific pieces so within the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.009" end="00:23:47.700" style="s2">design there is this well actually we</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.419" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">just came in so we&#39;ll zoom into a lower</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.700" end="00:23:50.869" style="s2">level so how do we instantiate this</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:54.119" style="s2">notion of top-down and bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.869" end="00:23:57.119" style="s2">simultaneously well with this with you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.119" end="00:24:00.539" style="s2">think about then is constructing an</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.119" end="00:24:04.950" style="s2">architecture that is set up in such a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.539" end="00:24:09.330" style="s2">way that it is simultaneously modular</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.950" end="00:24:13.730" style="s2">and fundamentally open meaning that it</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.330" end="00:24:16.730" style="s2">can go to where it needs to go but also</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.730" end="00:24:16.730" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.030" end="00:24:24.440" style="s2">creates boundary conditions that make</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:27.540" style="s2">and focus people&#39;s energy and attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.440" end="00:24:30.900" style="s2">so that it&#39;s not a random search right</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.540" end="00:24:33.860" style="s2">of the whole space so this is many</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.900" end="00:24:38.640" style="s2">people just call this good architecture</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.860" end="00:24:39.590" style="s2">but like that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:41.460" style="s2">architecture it&#39;s genius</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.590" end="00:24:43.230" style="s2">creating something which has the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.460" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">capacity to be very fluid and open</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.230" end="00:24:50.400" style="s2">modular in many ways easy to build and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:52.950" style="s2">construct on but at the same time is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.400" end="00:24:54.750" style="s2">has a set of intrinsic boundary</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.950" end="00:24:57.900" style="s2">conditions and initial conditions such</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.750" end="00:25:00.630" style="s2">that the right kinds of bottoms-up</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.900" end="00:25:03.990" style="s2">choices are probabilistically likely to</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.630" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">show up and to be sensed in such a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.990" end="00:25:10.800" style="s2">that they reinforce each other mm-hmm is</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">an act of genius and interesting I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.800" end="00:25:13.980" style="s2">sure if this is gonna be clarifying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:17.550" style="s2">anybody but it&#39;s actually the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.980" end="00:25:19.790" style="s2">thing that happened in Minecraft when</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.550" end="00:25:22.800" style="s2">notch built minecraft and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.790" end="00:25:26.820" style="s2">gigantic success of Minecraft I think is</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.800" end="00:25:28.920" style="s2">not confusing he was able to build</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.820" end="00:25:31.500" style="s2">something which was a sandbox yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.920" end="00:25:33.480" style="s2">was this inbox that also had the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.500" end="00:25:37.050" style="s2">kind of elements to cause people to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.480" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">actually play yeah in the sandbox in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.050" end="00:25:40.650" style="s2">way that was both fun and generative</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:42.150" style="s2">yeah I was just gonna make a sandbox</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.650" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">analogy myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.150" end="00:25:47.580" style="s2">it&#39;s like dow stock is providing not so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:50.430" style="s2">much a fixed offering in decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.580" end="00:25:53.790" style="s2">governance or a fixed set of software</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.430" end="00:25:57.510" style="s2">tools even but rather a kind of sandbox</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.790" end="00:26:00.150" style="s2">for ongoing experimentation in</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.510" end="00:26:03.330" style="s2">decentralized governance and as such</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.150" end="00:26:05.670" style="s2">provides the sandbox infrastructure like</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.330" end="00:26:08.520" style="s2">the sand as well as maybe a set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.670" end="00:26:10.140" style="s2">initial toys and tools to play with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.520" end="00:26:14.010" style="s2">initial it&#39;s it&#39;s the combination tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.140" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">if all I get so the the the Sahara</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.010" end="00:26:20.490" style="s2">Desert is not a sandbox right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:24.270" style="s2">a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a disaster it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.490" end="00:26:24.930" style="s2">potential is to open you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.270" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">anything with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.930" end="00:26:29.850" style="s2">mm-hmm sandbox is something that has the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:30.269" style="s2">ability to be extremely open and fluid</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.850" end="00:26:31.739" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.269" end="00:26:33.539" style="s2">the same time has the right kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.739" end="00:26:37.169" style="s2">constraints hints and elements that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.539" end="00:26:40.739" style="s2">actual structure will emerge on it yep</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.169" end="00:26:44.639" style="s2">which is I mean the if anybody spends</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.739" end="00:26:46.349" style="s2">time speaking to Matan and Adam by the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.639" end="00:26:47.789" style="s2">way both of whom I know reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.349" end="00:26:49.080" style="s2">I don&#39;t know a whole lot of the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.789" end="00:26:51.539" style="s2">folks as well so if you speak to any of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.080" end="00:26:52.859" style="s2">them yeah it doesn&#39;t take but a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.539" end="00:26:54.589" style="s2">seconds if you&#39;re paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.859" end="00:27:02.969" style="s2">recognize that you&#39;re dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.589" end="00:27:05.089" style="s2">kind of mind that is not well normal and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.969" end="00:27:07.409" style="s2">I mean that in the mathematical sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.089" end="00:27:08.700" style="s2">and also with a psychological sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.409" end="00:27:11.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of mind that one would</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.700" end="00:27:15.239" style="s2">hope is what you&#39;d put on this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.429" end="00:27:17.309" style="s2">project yeah yeah great I feel like this</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.239" end="00:27:18.359" style="s2">could be a good place to wrap is there</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.309" end="00:27:20.909" style="s2">anything else you&#39;d like to add no I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.359" end="00:27:23.820" style="s2">feel like that was actually I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.909" end="00:27:26.820" style="s2">was pretty good yeah yeah I think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.820" end="00:27:29.099" style="s2">covered some great territory so Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.820" end="00:27:30.989" style="s2">thanks a lot for your time it was great</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.099" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">talking with you like to see but all</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.989" end="00:27:33.440" style="s2">right okay</p>
