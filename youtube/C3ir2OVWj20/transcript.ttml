<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">are going to try to grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:37.950" style="s2">together last time we started what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.180" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">think is a very healthy tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.950" end="00:00:42.180" style="s2">light of how things are going in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:44.340" style="s2">where instead of diving right into the</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.180" end="00:00:47.730" style="s2">ultra timely ultra heavy material we</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.340" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">start with something amusing a joke an</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.730" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">anecdote something just to set the mood</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:55.079" style="s2">so that we all feel okay so with that</p>

<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">on a different topic the lesson is</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.189" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">married as much as it gets a bad rap</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">people say it&#39;s just a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:12.600" style="s2">why do I need the government to sanction</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">my relationship marriage is a marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.600" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">thing and among its best features or it</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">makes it really complicated and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">expensive for someone to leave you this</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">is truly presumably also so expensive</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">yeah I haven&#39;t checked but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:30.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard yeah but just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">thinking through all the steps that be</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.270" end="00:01:32.180" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:34.350" style="s2">let&#39;s just put it this way Heather</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.180" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">however expensive you have heard</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.350" end="00:01:40.130" style="s2">divorces I think it&#39;s way worse than</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:45.079" style="s2">that sure it&#39;s this is fabulous great</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.130" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">alright so we do have a lot going on we</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.689" end="00:02:11.459" style="s2">an autonomous zone having been declared</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">in the center of Seattle which I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.459" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">say would be absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">beyond belief if we hadn&#39;t already seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:22.019" style="s2">this block and a half from our own home</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:25.140" style="s2">at Evergreen in 2017 so that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.019" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">we have a shooting that has just taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.140" end="00:02:28.290" style="s2">place in Atlanta that is suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">trending on Twitter there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.290" end="00:02:32.579" style="s2">things that need to be discussed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:34.920" style="s2">carefully and of course there&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.579" end="00:02:37.049" style="s2">any time to parse these things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.920" end="00:02:39.689" style="s2">figure out how to get into them in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.049" end="00:02:41.970" style="s2">that everybody can get their footing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.689" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">anyway I think you have a sense of where</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.970" end="00:02:45.690" style="s2">we might we might begin with that</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">material here well actually what I have</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.690" end="00:02:48.629" style="s2">what I&#39;ve written up but I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:49.819" style="s2">by showing us and I&#39;ve written up isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.629" end="00:02:52.709" style="s2">directly about either of those things</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.819" end="00:02:55.409" style="s2">but it obviously speaks to the current</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.709" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">moment so I think we&#39;re gonna start by</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.409" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">showing a video that you would point it</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:04.079" style="s2">out to me it&#39;s a bit over two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:05.700" style="s2">long and and then I have a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.079" end="00:03:07.590" style="s2">monologue and then we&#39;ll launch into</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.700" end="00:03:47.629" style="s2">everything else so Zack if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.590" end="00:03:51.329" style="s2">show the first video I am NOT your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.629" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">you are not my enemy yet this land no</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.329" end="00:04:04.099" style="s2">matter what but in the day no matter</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:04:04.099" style="s2">what I&#39;m here for you okay</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:41.919" style="s2">one of a couple very much like it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.889" end="00:05:43.539" style="s2">we have now seen and before you get to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.919" end="00:05:46.509" style="s2">your comments about it I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.539" end="00:05:48.099" style="s2">put a placeholder here and say I not</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.509" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">only want to talk about what that video</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.099" end="00:05:54.490" style="s2">means but I want to talk about what role</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:57.070" style="s2">it is or isn&#39;t playing in our discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.490" end="00:05:59.169" style="s2">of the current moment so we&#39;ll return to</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.070" end="00:06:02.020" style="s2">that later all right all right</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.169" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">so in this video we have people clearly</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.909" end="00:06:16.599" style="s2">want to remind us of the First Amendment</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.289" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">as I did a couple of episodes ago and 20</p>

<p begin="00:06:52.220" end="00:06:55.640" style="s2">the last clip was making an appeal to</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.930" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">here is another one no less important</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.230" end="00:07:23.450" style="s2">but harder for most to grapple with the</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.480" end="00:14:30.610" style="s2">actually dovetails very well with what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.370" end="00:14:33.580" style="s2">think the secondary meaning of that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.610" end="00:14:35.650" style="s2">video that we saw is so I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.580" end="00:14:38.589" style="s2">to back us up slightly and put something</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.650" end="00:14:40.540" style="s2">on the table so late last night as I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.589" end="00:14:43.810" style="s2">trying to get one of our cats to come in</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.540" end="00:14:46.300" style="s2">I went for a walk with the dog and I was</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.960" end="00:14:58.510" style="s2">moment and there was a lot in it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.210" end="00:15:03.490" style="s2">really well done and I recommend it the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.510" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">purpose of the of the piece is largely</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.490" end="00:15:08.170" style="s2">to do something that I&#39;ve advocated many</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:09.400" style="s2">times I&#39;ve said in order to have in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:11.110" style="s2">order to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.400" end="00:15:13.620" style="s2">compassionate policy you have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.110" end="00:15:16.690" style="s2">dispassionate analysis right it feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.620" end="00:15:19.300" style="s2">counterintuitive but anyway he does a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.690" end="00:15:22.690" style="s2">very good job of going through these</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.300" end="00:15:24.820" style="s2">statistics that accompany use of lethal</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.690" end="00:15:26.650" style="s2">force by police and what it has to say</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.820" end="00:15:30.070" style="s2">about the presence or absence of racism</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.650" end="00:15:31.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s really it&#39;s remarkably careful</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.070" end="00:15:33.580" style="s2">but the place he starts is someplace</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.840" end="00:15:36.190" style="s2">that I think a lot of us have landed in</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.580" end="00:15:38.170" style="s2">independently he alleges that we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.190" end="00:15:40.570" style="s2">actually losing our minds and that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.170" end="00:15:44.200" style="s2">has something to do with the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.570" end="00:15:46.030" style="s2">and we&#39;ve talked about this and anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.200" end="00:15:47.770" style="s2">think I think all people who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.030" end="00:15:49.480" style="s2">to grapple with the meaning of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.770" end="00:15:51.460" style="s2">moment are landing on this formulation</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.480" end="00:15:53.740" style="s2">but the question is okay we&#39;re losing</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.460" end="00:15:56.530" style="s2">our minds but can we say anything more</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.740" end="00:15:59.530" style="s2">about it and the reason that that video</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.530" end="00:16:02.020" style="s2">of that apparently peaceful protests are</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.530" end="00:16:04.300" style="s2">being hauled off I mean hauled out of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.020" end="00:16:06.250" style="s2">crowd specifically because he&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.300" end="00:16:08.650" style="s2">talking that really looks like an</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.250" end="00:16:10.480" style="s2">egregious violation of his First</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.650" end="00:16:12.010" style="s2">Amendment rights and it&#39;s not the only</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.480" end="00:16:14.140" style="s2">video that looks like this but what</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.010" end="00:16:17.470" style="s2">struck me most was that I had not seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.140" end="00:16:20.410" style="s2">them right I came to that video because</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.470" end="00:16:22.150" style="s2">Sam Harris said something on his Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.410" end="00:16:23.830" style="s2">feed about what is the meaning of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.150" end="00:16:26.020" style="s2">videos in which apparently peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.830" end="00:16:28.270" style="s2">protesters are addressed by the police</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.020" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">and I thought I haven&#39;t seen those</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.270" end="00:16:31.510" style="s2">videos I&#39;ve seen videos in which the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:33.010" style="s2">police are very aggressive but I also</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.510" end="00:16:34.600" style="s2">know that the protesters are being very</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.010" end="00:16:37.570" style="s2">aggressive what&#39;s he talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.600" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">and so I went looking and I found videos</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.570" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">on Camille Foster&#39;s Twitter feed and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:44.710" style="s2">looked at them and they were exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:48.580" style="s2">described and I thought this is so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.710" end="00:16:50.440" style="s2">relevant at this moment that the fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.580" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">that I am not running into it is telling</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.440" end="00:16:54.730" style="s2">us something and I think what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:57.700" style="s2">telling us is that Twitter&#39;s algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.730" end="00:17:00.040" style="s2">whatever it is thinks I&#39;m a conservative</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.700" end="00:17:02.230" style="s2">because I say a lot of things about what</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.040" end="00:17:04.540" style="s2">isn&#39;t right over on the left and it has</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.230" end="00:17:06.820" style="s2">misunderstood me and also it thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.540" end="00:17:08.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re conservative which you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.820" end="00:17:12.010" style="s2">but that if you were a conservative you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.680" end="00:17:15.339" style="s2">would be uninterested in seeing things</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.010" end="00:17:17.950" style="s2">that confound your current views right</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.339" end="00:17:20.680" style="s2">or maybe even to say that it thinks is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.950" end="00:17:23.680" style="s2">the mistake because what it is doing I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.680" end="00:17:26.050" style="s2">would suggest is it is simply fee</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.680" end="00:17:28.840" style="s2">people that which confirms what they</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.050" end="00:17:32.590" style="s2">already believe and so here&#39;s my very</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.840" end="00:17:34.450" style="s2">simple contention about some large</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.590" end="00:17:35.040" style="s2">fraction of what is taking place at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.450" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.040" end="00:17:41.110" style="s2">everybody is plugged into an apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:44.560" style="s2">that is sitting in between us the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.110" end="00:17:46.840" style="s2">conversation used to and what it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.560" end="00:17:48.490" style="s2">doing is it is feeding us things that</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.840" end="00:17:52.930" style="s2">confirm what we actually believe much of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.490" end="00:17:55.420" style="s2">which is real but that in effect people</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.930" end="00:17:57.490" style="s2">smart scientific people who know very</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.420" end="00:18:00.190" style="s2">well that the right way to think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.490" end="00:18:01.990" style="s2">carefully is to be falsification astute</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.190" end="00:18:04.450" style="s2">for things that disconfirm your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.990" end="00:18:06.610" style="s2">are being fed and overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.450" end="00:18:08.680" style="s2">verification aestethic and that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.610" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">causing everybody to be dead sure they</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.680" end="00:18:13.870" style="s2">know what&#39;s going on when very few of us</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">have any clue and one thing that is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.870" end="00:18:17.890" style="s2">different about this moment than the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:21.130" style="s2">moment of 20 years ago or 40 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.890" end="00:18:22.780" style="s2">is that we had editors and people have</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.130" end="00:18:25.270" style="s2">complained about editors and the move</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.780" end="00:18:28.120" style="s2">towards social media is seen by some as</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.270" end="00:18:32.260" style="s2">a populist revolution in which anyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.120" end="00:18:35.020" style="s2">can have voice but if you want to watch</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.260" end="00:18:36.700" style="s2">fox news and also want to watch CNN you</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.020" end="00:18:39.130" style="s2">know something about the editorial</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.700" end="00:18:40.900" style="s2">biases of those networks and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.130" end="00:18:43.720" style="s2">choose to watch both and you know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.900" end="00:18:46.090" style="s2">you are going to get still skewed still</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.720" end="00:18:49.030" style="s2">edited still presumably biased but</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.090" end="00:18:51.850" style="s2">versions of the biases and edits of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.030" end="00:18:55.840" style="s2">those perspective networks whereas on</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.650" end="00:19:11.980" style="s2">don&#39;t follow thousands of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.970" end="00:19:13.810" style="s2">specifically so that I can see what</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.980" end="00:19:16.450" style="s2">these people are saying there are many</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.810" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">people whom you and I follow who have</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.450" end="00:19:20.800" style="s2">been posting these videos and neither of</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:22.990" style="s2">us were seeing them that tells us that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.800" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">this is not the same as being able to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.990" end="00:19:26.830" style="s2">and decide I&#39;m going to read the New</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.210" end="00:19:48.730" style="s2">you have to swim upstream to counteract</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.610" end="00:19:51.640" style="s2">the algorithm and so this is having an</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.640" end="00:20:00.040" style="s2">think and for me the iconic instance of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.290" end="00:20:02.920" style="s2">this is Dave Chappelle&#39;s new video right</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.440" end="00:20:20.230" style="s2">not really a comedy piece and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.669" end="00:20:22.630" style="s2">Chappelle talks about that and I must</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.230" end="00:20:27.700" style="s2">say I know you share my feelings about</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.630" end="00:20:31.990" style="s2">this but I think Chappelle is he&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.700" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">love and gratitude for what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.780" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">delivered this piece that he&#39;s put out</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:59.380" style="s2">very popular piece retweeted by Joe</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:01.210" style="s2">Rogan very enthusiastically Barry Weiss</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.380" end="00:21:03.010" style="s2">I think who is punishing us for</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.210" end="00:21:10.059" style="s2">something I don&#39;t know what but in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.010" end="00:21:15.160" style="s2">case the the Chappelle piece is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.059" end="00:21:17.740" style="s2">and it&#39;s wrong completely authentically</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.160" end="00:21:19.510" style="s2">and so anyway in some sense no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.740" end="00:21:21.220" style="s2">speaking there presumably many of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.510" end="00:21:23.650" style="s2">people watching have seen it or you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.220" end="00:21:25.000" style="s2">you you guys have the luxury of stepping</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.650" end="00:21:27.520" style="s2">aside and watching and I don&#39;t at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.000" end="00:21:29.260" style="s2">moment yeah what what is wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.520" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">what I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I&#39;m asking that up</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.260" end="00:21:31.809" style="s2">because I&#39;ve seen it and don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:33.010" style="s2">anything wrong but because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.809" end="00:21:35.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s in it what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.010" end="00:21:38.799" style="s2">with it is that it doesn&#39;t take into</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.710" end="00:21:40.780" style="s2">account what sam harris painstakingly</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.799" end="00:21:43.299" style="s2">goes through which is that our</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.780" end="00:21:46.450" style="s2">intuitions about what is going on have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.299" end="00:21:51.550" style="s2">very little to do with what the data</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.450" end="00:21:53.680" style="s2">suggests is going on and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.550" end="00:21:55.810" style="s2">now I want to be very careful that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.680" end="00:21:57.490" style="s2">people do not misinterpret what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.810" end="00:22:00.430" style="s2">saying I think there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.490" end="00:22:02.050" style="s2">real about this moment and this protest</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.430" end="00:22:05.620" style="s2">and one of the things is driving me</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.050" end="00:22:08.980" style="s2">crazy is that the message is so wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.620" end="00:22:12.220" style="s2">the focus is so wrong that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.980" end="00:22:14.740" style="s2">understand that the tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.220" end="00:22:16.570" style="s2">frustration that is boiling over in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.740" end="00:22:18.790" style="s2">streets and frankly threatening the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.570" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">Republic and maybe more that that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.790" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">frustration is simply being delivered</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:26.770" style="s2">with a false set of labels and so we</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:30.250" style="s2">don&#39;t even know how to interpret it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.770" end="00:22:33.130" style="s2">so my point to you is that Chapelle</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.250" end="00:22:36.130" style="s2">looks at the protests and he says</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.130" end="00:22:38.170" style="s2">effectively you&#39;re goddamn right right</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.130" end="00:22:40.090" style="s2">of course people are angry of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.170" end="00:22:41.950" style="s2">they&#39;re angry and he talks about some of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.090" end="00:22:44.950" style="s2">these cases that we&#39;ve seen on video</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.950" end="00:22:48.070" style="s2">that just seems so upsetting right but</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.950" end="00:22:51.040" style="s2">the problem is that those cases are at</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.070" end="00:22:53.020" style="s2">best anecdotes and of course even if</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.040" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">those cases are exactly what we think</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.020" end="00:22:58.420" style="s2">they are the fact that those cases may</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">not be disproportionate suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.420" end="00:23:02.020" style="s2">race may not be playing the role that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:04.390" style="s2">think it&#39;s playing and does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.020" end="00:23:08.530" style="s2">that black people are not perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.390" end="00:23:10.750" style="s2">some sort of substantial obstacle that</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.530" end="00:23:13.450" style="s2">is blocking progress that I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.750" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">has stalled progress no they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.450" end="00:23:17.380" style="s2">detecting something and when you see</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.390" style="s2">somebody do something egregious on</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.380" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">videotape and you feel this force</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.390" end="00:23:23.080" style="s2">holding you back and you put two and two</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:26.200" style="s2">together and you say those two things</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.080" end="00:23:28.300" style="s2">are the same thing right you may not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.200" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">right it may be that those things have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.300" end="00:23:32.260" style="s2">nothing to do with each other and as I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">have said before the visceral anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.260" end="00:23:36.370" style="s2">will always be more powerful than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.500" style="s2">dispassionate statistic right and if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.370" end="00:23:42.490" style="s2">can take a non-racial example I said in</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.500" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">my talk how the magic trick is done that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.490" end="00:23:47.470" style="s2">a woman who&#39;s walking down the street</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:49.930" style="s2">who takes some look that I give her to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.470" end="00:23:53.170" style="s2">be full of some kind of meaning that she</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.930" end="00:23:55.270" style="s2">finds creepy doesn&#39;t know whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.170" end="00:23:57.430" style="s2">actually a creepy look or am I just</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.270" end="00:23:58.540" style="s2">awkward and I gave the guy who walked</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.430" end="00:24:01.330" style="s2">down the street next to her the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.540" end="00:24:03.880" style="s2">weird look right you can&#39;t tell if all</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.330" end="00:24:05.120" style="s2">you have is an edit and so what we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.880" end="00:24:10.020" style="s2">is in an hair</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.120" end="00:24:13.500" style="s2">leigh-anne inherently biased set it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.020" end="00:24:15.240" style="s2">much more interesting in some sense when</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.500" end="00:24:17.310" style="s2">the thing matches some narrative about</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.240" end="00:24:19.140" style="s2">some very powerful force of racism that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.310" end="00:24:20.970" style="s2">is alive and well in the US and you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.140" end="00:24:23.220" style="s2">what there is a force of racism that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.970" end="00:24:25.350" style="s2">alive and well in the US but it&#39;s small</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.220" end="00:24:28.170" style="s2">right most people are not encountering</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.350" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">it every day the number of you know one</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.170" end="00:24:34.790" style="s2">of the things that Sam reveals is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:39.570" style="s2">actually in 2019 the number of police</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.790" end="00:24:41.040" style="s2">shootings was at an all-time low</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.570" end="00:24:42.630" style="s2">the number of killings by police in Los</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.040" end="00:24:44.550" style="s2">Angeles in 2019 was at an all-time low</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.630" end="00:24:45.600" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.550" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">question about are we moving in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.600" end="00:24:49.230" style="s2">right direction are these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:52.050" style="s2">racially biased these are questions that</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:54.660" style="s2">are addressed by tools that we know now</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.050" end="00:24:58.170" style="s2">here&#39;s the crazy thing what did we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.660" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">this last week those very tools are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.170" end="00:25:08.250" style="s2">under attack shut down stem Y is shut</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:10.890" style="s2">down stem marching with some cartoonish</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.250" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">presentation of the role racism is</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.890" end="00:25:17.430" style="s2">playing in America because if you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:19.020" style="s2">the tools then you can test the claim so</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.430" end="00:25:21.090" style="s2">those who are advancing false claims</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.020" end="00:25:23.490" style="s2">have an interest in shutting down those</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.090" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">tools shutting down any claim that has</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.490" end="00:25:29.610" style="s2">been demonstrated with them any doubt</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:31.320" style="s2">that has been established and so well</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.610" end="00:25:33.720" style="s2">this emerges in part I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.320" end="00:25:36.540" style="s2">quote I will I will paraphrase it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.720" end="00:25:40.740" style="s2">hopefully I don&#39;t butcher it but the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.540" end="00:25:42.600" style="s2">Audrey Lorde quotation from I think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.740" end="00:25:44.760" style="s2">will have been the 1970s in which she</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.600" end="00:25:46.740" style="s2">says you don&#39;t you can&#39;t tear down the</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.740" end="00:25:52.470" style="s2">know which is a ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.590" end="00:25:55.260" style="s2">disempowering message actually as as so</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.470" end="00:25:57.630" style="s2">much of the material in the message</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.260" end="00:26:00.030" style="s2">income coming across the transom from</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.630" end="00:26:03.180" style="s2">these these movements these so-called</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.030" end="00:26:04.890" style="s2">anti-racist movements are often actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.180" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">disempowering for exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.890" end="00:26:09.630" style="s2">populations whom they are purporting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">try to raise up right and to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.630" end="00:26:17.970" style="s2">that so my claim about Chappell would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">that he is he would present the story as</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.970" end="00:26:21.190" style="s2">it really is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:23.320" style="s2">if he could see it but he is also</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.190" end="00:26:26.190" style="s2">subject to a world of algorithms that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.320" end="00:26:29.530" style="s2">have categorized him some way and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.190" end="00:26:32.169" style="s2">somehow I think he&#39;s missed the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.530" end="00:26:35.460" style="s2">but he&#39;s still Dave Chappelle so in some</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.169" end="00:26:37.390" style="s2">sense as much as I hate to see him</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.460" end="00:26:40.410" style="s2">present something that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.390" end="00:26:43.480" style="s2">incorrect it&#39;s also hopeful because</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.410" end="00:26:46.090" style="s2">being Dave Chappelle he&#39;s capable of</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.480" end="00:26:49.090" style="s2">seeing it right and so what would be</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.090" end="00:26:51.130" style="s2">amazing is if there was a dialogue in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.090" end="00:26:53.020" style="s2">which the point was okay Dave we heard</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.130" end="00:26:54.730" style="s2">what you have to say here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.020" end="00:26:57.070" style="s2">counterpoint that would be a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.730" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">dialogue yeah no it certainly would and</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.070" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">this is gonna seem wrong but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">responding with an anecdote but I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:06.520" style="s2">that the point here is that here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:09.940" style="s2">here&#39;s one of my interactions with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.520" end="00:27:11.530" style="s2">police from when I was in high school in</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.940" end="00:27:15.250" style="s2">the would have been the mid to late 80s</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.530" end="00:27:19.750" style="s2">87 maybe when I was newly driving and my</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.250" end="00:27:23.020" style="s2">point here is going to be I got to see I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.750" end="00:27:24.580" style="s2">got to see firsthand that there was</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.020" end="00:27:27.220" style="s2">disparity at least for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.580" end="00:27:31.240" style="s2">police officers in LA in the 80s between</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.220" end="00:27:35.380" style="s2">how they treated a black person versus</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.380" end="00:27:38.620" style="s2">it stuck with me and this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.090" end="00:27:40.809" style="s2">this has been one of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.620" end="00:27:44.290" style="s2">have I&#39;ve told you I&#39;ve only said it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.809" end="00:27:47.080" style="s2">publicly once actually before now but my</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.290" end="00:27:48.700" style="s2">point ultimately is things have gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.080" end="00:27:51.160" style="s2">lot better since then and the way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.700" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">assess that claim is through the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.160" end="00:27:55.900" style="s2">statistics the very statistics that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:28:00.790" style="s2">say that Sam Harris was going through in</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.900" end="00:28:02.830" style="s2">his most recent podcast so it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.790" end="00:28:06.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s a short little anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.830" end="00:28:10.450" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m driving in my ten-year-old car</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.600" end="00:28:13.090" style="s2">on Sunset Boulevard on the curvy part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.450" end="00:28:15.309" style="s2">Sunset Boulevard in West LA where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.090" end="00:28:17.770" style="s2">the speed limit is 35 but if you enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.309" end="00:28:22.390" style="s2">driving and if you&#39;re breaking the law</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.770" end="00:28:24.040" style="s2">you might go 50 and I come around a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.390" end="00:28:27.309" style="s2">curve and someone else is doing the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.040" end="00:28:28.929" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a little the day and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.309" end="00:28:31.500" style="s2">only time this ever happened pretty</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.929" end="00:28:35.430" style="s2">quickly four of us in a pack of cars are</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.500" end="00:28:37.830" style="s2">driving stupidly fast on sunset and we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.430" end="00:28:40.500" style="s2">come around one curve and there&#39;s a cop</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.830" end="00:28:43.620" style="s2">waiting his cops often were you know in</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.500" end="00:28:46.170" style="s2">a car turns out a siren pulls out behind</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.620" end="00:28:49.620" style="s2">us you know directs us into the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.170" end="00:28:51.570" style="s2">into the next side street and pulls us</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.620" end="00:28:53.310" style="s2">all over as he should have we were being</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.570" end="00:28:57.300" style="s2">a responsible no none of us knew each</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.310" end="00:29:00.570" style="s2">other we just spontaneous street racing</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.300" end="00:29:02.130" style="s2">taking his street racing right and none</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.570" end="00:29:05.010" style="s2">of us knew each other none of us were</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.130" end="00:29:07.110" style="s2">driving fancier expensive cars and none</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.010" end="00:29:08.850" style="s2">of us knew until the moment that he</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.110" end="00:29:11.160" style="s2">forced us all over as he should have</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.850" end="00:29:12.630" style="s2">done and it was a a white cop with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.160" end="00:29:15.780" style="s2">white guy who the white cop sitting next</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.630" end="00:29:18.150" style="s2">to him got out of the car and he ordered</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.780" end="00:29:21.420" style="s2">all of us out of the car barking equally</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.150" end="00:29:22.920" style="s2">at each of us and we got out and I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.420" end="00:29:25.170" style="s2">the only person in my car and I&#39;m white</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.920" end="00:29:27.030" style="s2">and there were a couple of people on</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.170" end="00:29:30.330" style="s2">each of two of the other cars and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.030" end="00:29:33.690" style="s2">were white and the fourth car had a</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.330" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">young black man it and the cop proceeded</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.690" end="00:29:40.170" style="s2">to speak very gently and politely to me</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:43.290" style="s2">and to the other white people and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.170" end="00:29:46.260" style="s2">other cars and quite differently quite</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.290" end="00:29:49.290" style="s2">aggressively at quite quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.260" end="00:29:50.850" style="s2">volume to this young black man and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.290" end="00:29:53.040" style="s2">fact is in this case we had all been</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.850" end="00:29:55.350" style="s2">behaving exactly the same way we were</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.040" end="00:29:59.190" style="s2">all kiltie of exactly the same crime</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.350" end="00:30:00.960" style="s2">right and as far as I can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.190" end="00:30:03.750" style="s2">outcome of this is that he led us all</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.960" end="00:30:05.460" style="s2">off with warning so the formal legal</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.750" end="00:30:08.310" style="s2">outcome was it was equivalent for</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.460" end="00:30:10.740" style="s2">everyone but the fact is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.310" end="00:30:13.110" style="s2">four items in this case one of four</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.740" end="00:30:14.640" style="s2">drivers doing exactly the same thing got</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.110" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">singled out for treatment on the basis</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.640" end="00:30:17.460" style="s2">of what there was only one thing that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:19.740" style="s2">could see that was different about him</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.460" end="00:30:23.490" style="s2">and it was his skin colour that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.740" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">have been I think 1986 1987 and it that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.490" end="00:30:27.930" style="s2">was an anecdote and I had no access to</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:30.540" style="s2">the statistics at that time but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.930" end="00:30:33.420" style="s2">understood in my gut that there was</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.540" end="00:30:35.450" style="s2">something about driving while black that</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.420" end="00:30:39.030" style="s2">was real that would never be true for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.450" end="00:30:42.060" style="s2">question is to what extent have police</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.030" end="00:30:44.490" style="s2">improved and has it become ever less</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.060" end="00:30:48.300" style="s2">acceptable to be racist in Americans</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.490" end="00:30:50.550" style="s2">in the years since then yes and so it</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.300" end="00:30:52.890" style="s2">you know I think driving while black</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.550" end="00:30:54.150" style="s2">registered with a lot of us we got it</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:55.980" style="s2">then there was a different experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.150" end="00:30:59.220" style="s2">and that this was something so</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.980" end="00:31:01.320" style="s2">universally shared by black people that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.220" end="00:31:05.250" style="s2">even though white people were unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.320" end="00:31:06.780" style="s2">to encounter it directly we inferred</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.250" end="00:31:08.220" style="s2">that something there was something we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.780" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">could not see a force we could not see</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.220" end="00:31:11.850" style="s2">this is exactly the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">will happen in a world where the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.850" end="00:31:17.160" style="s2">algorithms feed you that which you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:20.190" style="s2">expect or want to hear and so we are now</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.160" end="00:31:23.520" style="s2">watching a movement that and I saw a</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.190" end="00:31:25.860" style="s2">remarkable footage of the protests in</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.520" end="00:31:29.300" style="s2">Paris this is spreading this is now a</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.860" end="00:31:33.000" style="s2">global phenomenon that is ostensibly</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.300" end="00:31:35.490" style="s2">reacting to a systematic pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.000" end="00:31:37.260" style="s2">lethal violence that is racially</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.490" end="00:31:41.580" style="s2">motivated amongst police that is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.260" end="00:31:44.610" style="s2">reflected in the data right that is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.580" end="00:31:46.230" style="s2">frightening prospect for two reasons one</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.610" end="00:31:47.760" style="s2">so can you spell that out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.230" end="00:31:50.100" style="s2">more I haven&#39;t seen what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.760" end="00:31:51.270" style="s2">Paris I&#39;d like to know exactly what I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.100" end="00:31:53.370" style="s2">like you to just maybe even just say</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.270" end="00:31:57.030" style="s2">that in different words I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.370" end="00:31:59.880" style="s2">think is taking place is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.030" end="00:32:01.830" style="s2">something deeply wrong you can feel it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.880" end="00:32:04.980" style="s2">in this Dave Chappelle piece right Dave</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.830" end="00:32:07.020" style="s2">Chappelle has had it he is sick and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.980" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">tired of being told there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.020" end="00:32:12.540" style="s2">problem and he has landed in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:14.580" style="s2">spot because the message is so</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.540" end="00:32:16.740" style="s2">overwhelming that you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.580" end="00:32:20.100" style="s2">problem in lethal violence by white cops</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.740" end="00:32:23.040" style="s2">against black citizens right that he is</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.100" end="00:32:26.790" style="s2">now he just simply didn&#39;t check it he</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.040" end="00:32:28.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t go falsification astray if he had</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.790" end="00:32:32.160" style="s2">what he would find is that the data do</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.920" end="00:32:35.430" style="s2">not reflect this pattern that it is true</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.160" end="00:32:37.530" style="s2">that blacks are disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.430" end="00:32:40.020" style="s2">killed by cops but not</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.530" end="00:32:42.840" style="s2">disproportionately relative to their</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.020" end="00:32:46.050" style="s2">disproportionate share of crime now the</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.840" end="00:32:48.390" style="s2">discussion I want to have is what is</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.050" end="00:32:50.340" style="s2">that disparity in crime about and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.390" end="00:32:52.620" style="s2">think a lot of people including a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.340" end="00:32:55.230" style="s2">frankly sophisticated white thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.620" end="00:32:57.490" style="s2">believe that this has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.230" end="00:32:58.780" style="s2">with black people being different</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.490" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s where this</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.780" end="00:33:05.380" style="s2">is coming from so what I said on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:07.179" style="s2">the other day was that this patterns</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.380" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">that we are seeing have very little to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.179" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">do with modern racism and have a lot to</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.380" style="s2">do with past racism and that this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:16.720" style="s2">different for two populations as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.380" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">said elsewhere black population and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.720" end="00:33:22.870" style="s2">Indian population in the u.s. have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">special situation other populations deal</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.870" end="00:33:25.990" style="s2">with racism there&#39;s a level of ambient</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:28.210" style="s2">racism it doesn&#39;t prevent them from</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.990" end="00:33:30.250" style="s2">succeeding these two populations have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.210" end="00:33:33.040" style="s2">special obstacle that they face and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.250" end="00:33:35.410" style="s2">what we are seeing and distinct from one</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.040" end="00:33:37.870" style="s2">another quite distinct but they share a</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.410" end="00:33:41.320" style="s2">feature right which is both of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.870" end="00:33:44.530" style="s2">cases there was a systematic effort to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.320" end="00:33:47.230" style="s2">erase the on board culture to neutralize</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.530" end="00:33:51.010" style="s2">the on board culture because that on</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.230" end="00:33:54.250" style="s2">board culture was dangerous to the role</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.010" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">that white people that European people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.250" end="00:34:00.280" style="s2">needed these populations to to play so</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:02.860" style="s2">so just at the most at the most surface</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.280" end="00:34:05.610" style="s2">level do the explicit taking of Native</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.860" end="00:34:08.169" style="s2">American children and putting them into</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.610" end="00:34:10.840" style="s2">white schools basically re educating</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.379" end="00:34:34.899" style="s2">right the breaking apart of families</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">right the mixing of people who were from</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.899" end="00:34:38.379" style="s2">different had different traditions to</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.490" end="00:34:40.030" style="s2">begin with so that everything starts out</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.379" end="00:34:41.649" style="s2">as a pidgin and then becomes a Creole</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.030" end="00:34:43.540" style="s2">but it&#39;s not it&#39;s nobody&#39;s original</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.540" end="00:34:49.659" style="s2">historic racism hasn&#39;t been a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:52.629" style="s2">force throughout throughout the 15 16 17</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.659" end="00:34:54.909" style="s2">18 19 century but it&#39;s not even this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.629" end="00:34:56.830" style="s2">racism with a special mechanism right</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.909" end="00:34:58.980" style="s2">this special mechanism takes the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.830" end="00:35:01.240" style="s2">cultural program that people have a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.980" end="00:35:03.310" style="s2">disrupts the connection with the thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.240" end="00:35:06.460" style="s2">to which it&#39;s evolved so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.310" end="00:35:09.220" style="s2">black people and Indians were removed</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.460" end="00:35:11.170" style="s2">from what you and I would technically</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.220" end="00:35:12.270" style="s2">call the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.170" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">an environment of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.270" end="00:35:17.049" style="s2">adaptiveness for their culture right so</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.700" style="s2">your culture matches your environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.049" end="00:35:20.200" style="s2">you remove people from their environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.700" end="00:35:21.910" style="s2">either by transporting them across an</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.200" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">ocean in a ship or by putting them on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.910" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">reservation and taking them off their</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:26.650" style="s2">ancestral lands right already they have</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:28.329" style="s2">a new problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.650" end="00:35:30.069" style="s2">right their culture is not adapted to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.329" end="00:35:32.740" style="s2">the place they&#39;ve just landed and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.069" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">you go through systematic process of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.740" end="00:35:36.250" style="s2">disrupting that culture further in order</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:37.869" style="s2">to make people compliant and docile and</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.250" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">unable to resist and all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.869" end="00:35:42.940" style="s2">and then something happens there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:45.400" style="s2">awakening this is wrong maybe you stop</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.940" end="00:35:49.510" style="s2">doing it but you don&#39;t fix the problem</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.400" end="00:35:51.940" style="s2">right and so anyway I believe that those</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.510" end="00:35:54.460" style="s2">things echo through to this moment in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.940" end="00:35:57.220" style="s2">most profound way and that it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.460" end="00:35:58.930" style="s2">resulting in the detection in these</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.220" end="00:36:00.579" style="s2">populations that something is wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.930" end="00:36:01.990" style="s2">no secret in these populations that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.579" end="00:36:03.549" style="s2">something is very secret is very</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.990" end="00:36:06.220" style="s2">seriously wrong mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.549" end="00:36:09.099" style="s2">but the question is what do you say if</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.220" end="00:36:11.890" style="s2">you if the problem is subtle right if</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.099" end="00:36:14.170" style="s2">the problem is one of somebody busted my</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.890" end="00:36:17.140" style="s2">software and then they loaded some</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.170" end="00:36:19.000" style="s2">software that works somewhat for me but</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.140" end="00:36:20.200" style="s2">it also works for them right and now I</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.000" end="00:36:21.670" style="s2">have a problem most people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.200" end="00:36:23.950" style="s2">because I have to disentangle those two</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.670" end="00:36:25.990" style="s2">forces right that&#39;s so you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.950" end="00:36:28.240" style="s2">about human soft right now oh yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.990" end="00:36:29.829" style="s2">okay yeah I&#39;d be back up and make that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.240" end="00:36:31.210" style="s2">super clear because I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.829" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">computers until the end of that sentence</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.210" end="00:36:37.180" style="s2">no no yeah yeah I mean computers were</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:39.190" style="s2">very rare until the 20th century that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.180" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">how I understand it yeah but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.190" end="00:36:44.109" style="s2">so there is a real problem but I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:45.640" style="s2">the point I&#39;m getting at is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.109" end="00:36:47.380" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t a serious problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.640" end="00:36:50.109" style="s2">every bit as serious as people perceive</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.380" end="00:36:51.970" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t housed in these simple</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.109" end="00:36:54.309" style="s2">things what&#39;s the problem with being</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.970" end="00:36:55.900" style="s2">black it&#39;s that you know you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.309" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2">danger of being slaughtered on any given</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.900" end="00:37:01.030" style="s2">day by a police officer no for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:03.339" style="s2">we can check that we can check it with</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.030" end="00:37:04.720" style="s2">the tools of stem right why are we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.339" end="00:37:06.609" style="s2">shutting down stem because you can check</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.720" end="00:37:08.170" style="s2">it with the tools of stem and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.609" end="00:37:11.470" style="s2">because there&#39;s only one explanation</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.170" end="00:37:13.990" style="s2">allowed because we have compelled speech</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.470" end="00:37:16.359" style="s2">which moves us into compelled thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.990" end="00:37:19.630" style="s2">right and you must destroy stem in order</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.359" end="00:37:21.430" style="s2">to not have people say actually there</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.630" end="00:37:24.160" style="s2">are a lot of possible explanations let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.430" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">figure out which one is true let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.160" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">yep so so that that raises the question</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:32.670" style="s2">then of what is taking place so the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:36.340" style="s2">tough thing I think if you&#39;re being fed</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.670" end="00:37:38.970" style="s2">some analog of what I&#39;m seeing right the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.340" end="00:37:42.190" style="s2">temptation is just to say well okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.970" end="00:37:43.570" style="s2">this movement is phony the claims are</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.190" end="00:37:46.750" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.570" end="00:37:49.210" style="s2">this is jeopardizing the Republic let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.750" end="00:37:53.350" style="s2">just shut it down right and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.210" end="00:37:54.100" style="s2">awareness that the claims are wrong in</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.350" end="00:37:56.440" style="s2">my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.100" end="00:37:58.600" style="s2">the named movements that are at the head</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.440" end="00:38:00.310" style="s2">of this thing are illegitimate they are</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.600" end="00:38:04.120" style="s2">pushing a phony story and they are</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.310" end="00:38:06.370" style="s2">pushing the most absurd remedies I can</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.120" end="00:38:09.910" style="s2">imagine I mean the idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.370" end="00:38:11.590" style="s2">talking about abolishing the police and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.910" end="00:38:13.180" style="s2">you&#39;ve got maybe this is where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.590" end="00:38:15.160" style="s2">going but you&#39;ve got a video that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.180" end="00:38:17.290" style="s2">gonna have Zach show with another one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.160" end="00:38:18.610" style="s2">these proposed remedies oh we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.290" end="00:38:20.140" style="s2">go with a number of these things maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.610" end="00:38:24.820" style="s2">we should in fact hey Zach can you put</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.140" end="00:38:26.860" style="s2">up the New York Times piece here so</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.820" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">first of all we have been in endless</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.860" end="00:38:32.830" style="s2">arguments we hear people say defund the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:35.830" style="s2">police abolish the police hold on a</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.830" end="00:38:37.630" style="s2">second and we are always when we say</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.830" end="00:38:39.670" style="s2">abolish the police do you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.630" end="00:38:41.740" style="s2">there&#39;s not a neighborhood in America</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.670" end="00:38:43.360" style="s2">where that would not be a catastrophe no</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.740" end="00:38:45.310" style="s2">matter how bad your police are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.360" end="00:38:47.020" style="s2">no place where removing them would be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.310" end="00:38:49.360" style="s2">net gain for the people who live there</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.020" end="00:38:51.030" style="s2">and then we&#39;re told so actually I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.360" end="00:38:55.150" style="s2">come up with a name for this that Steve</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.030" end="00:38:58.360" style="s2">as recline off&#39; occation of language</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.150" end="00:39:00.250" style="s2">right so Ezra Klein takes something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.360" end="00:39:03.070" style="s2">kill all men and he says well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.250" end="00:39:05.110" style="s2">really what they mean so in this case</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.070" end="00:39:07.030" style="s2">we&#39;ve got you know there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.110" end="00:39:09.130" style="s2">police and then he you know somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.030" end="00:39:11.500" style="s2">gonna come in and they&#39;re gonna as</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.130" end="00:39:13.150" style="s2">recline of fuck the thing up and tell us</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.500" end="00:39:14.830" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t mean abolish the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.150" end="00:39:17.050" style="s2">police that it means something else like</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.830" end="00:39:19.630" style="s2">reform them or you know demilitarized</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.050" end="00:39:20.980" style="s2">them or something like that but then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.630" end="00:39:22.300" style="s2">find out in the New York Times actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.980" end="00:39:27.220" style="s2">lo and behold we were right all along</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.300" end="00:39:30.790" style="s2">okay you can now put it up here we go</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.220" end="00:39:33.820" style="s2">okay yes we literally mean abolish the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.790" end="00:39:35.080" style="s2">police okay I knew that you knew that</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.820" end="00:39:36.630" style="s2">because we&#39;ve actually had the police</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.080" end="00:39:38.250" style="s2">abolished on us</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.630" end="00:39:39.780" style="s2">in the New York Times under its new</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.250" end="00:39:41.700" style="s2">leadership has gone in the head and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.780" end="00:39:44.340" style="s2">given us the evidence that we were</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.700" end="00:39:46.530" style="s2">looking for thank you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.340" end="00:39:47.970" style="s2">well I mean you know in a sense they</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.530" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">have done us a service because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.970" end="00:39:51.000" style="s2">you know and this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.400" style="s2">arguments that those of us who are</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.000" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">fiercely in favor of maintaining free</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.400" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">speech even for abhorrent perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:03.720" style="s2">have said which is when somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:04.920" style="s2">advancing something truly awful you want</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.720" end="00:40:06.060" style="s2">to hear what they have to say you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.920" end="00:40:07.950" style="s2">want to shut it down because that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.060" end="00:40:10.770" style="s2">actually prevents us from being fully</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.950" end="00:40:12.900" style="s2">horrified so this article in The New</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.770" end="00:40:14.550" style="s2">York Times actually says look we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.900" end="00:40:16.740" style="s2">talking about literally about from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.550" end="00:40:19.140" style="s2">police they can&#39;t be reformed it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.740" end="00:40:22.350" style="s2">anywhere mention the net effect question</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.140" end="00:40:24.840" style="s2">well what they proposed with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.350" end="00:40:26.700" style="s2">law and order instead oh well they have</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.840" end="00:40:29.940" style="s2">lots of lovely proposals but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.700" end="00:40:32.340" style="s2">were this the least bit reasonable then</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.940" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">the point is we are going to provide</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.340" end="00:40:37.500" style="s2">this mechanism that makes the police</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:39.540" style="s2">unnecessary and then we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.500" end="00:40:41.850" style="s2">abolish the police that&#39;s not the point</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.540" end="00:40:44.250" style="s2">somehow these people are they&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.850" end="00:40:46.050" style="s2">confused or so disingenuous that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.250" end="00:40:50.370" style="s2">are actually advocating we abolish the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.050" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">police first right this is madness this</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.370" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">could not possibly be a dumber idea and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:58.260" style="s2">you and I have seen this in person we</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:01.050" style="s2">have had the police withdrawn from a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.260" end="00:41:03.270" style="s2">riot where they were shouting my name</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.050" end="00:41:05.250" style="s2">and they were apparently hunting for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.270" end="00:41:07.680" style="s2">one car to the next and the police were</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.250" end="00:41:10.260" style="s2">withdrawn from the situation we saw</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.680" end="00:41:13.470" style="s2">people inside of 24 hours of that order</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.260" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">battered by student protesters student</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.470" end="00:41:19.140" style="s2">on student violence with weapons for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:21.450" style="s2">crime of disagreeing we saw the whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.140" end="00:41:23.250" style="s2">thing unfold and the fact is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.450" end="00:41:25.860" style="s2">happening again it&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.250" end="00:41:27.060" style="s2">center of Seattle and you know I mean on</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.860" end="00:41:29.790" style="s2">the one hand I&#39;m kind of pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.060" end="00:41:31.620" style="s2">because I feel like we lived it so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.790" end="00:41:34.440" style="s2">other people don&#39;t have to and yet we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.620" end="00:41:36.150" style="s2">doing it again but all right second</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.440" end="00:41:38.910" style="s2">degree this stuff that&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.150" end="00:41:42.180" style="s2">Seattle is squarely and governor</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.910" end="00:41:44.370" style="s2">Inslee&#39;s Court like that goes on his</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.180" end="00:41:45.690" style="s2">ledger because he did nothing when</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.370" end="00:41:48.180" style="s2">Evergreen happened and he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.690" end="00:41:49.619" style="s2">nothing now he didn&#39;t even mention</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.180" end="00:41:51.540" style="s2">when Evergreen happened he went radio</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.619" end="00:41:54.180" style="s2">silent and was radio silent I believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.540" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">for years never mentioned evergreens was</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.180" end="00:41:58.410" style="s2">happening in his office we went to his</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:01.079" style="s2">office with your students asked for an</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.410" end="00:42:02.609" style="s2">audience got instead two of his two of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.079" end="00:42:03.809" style="s2">his aides it&#39;s on civil rights and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.609" end="00:42:05.819" style="s2">on higher ed yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.809" end="00:42:07.290" style="s2">spent two hours talking to them we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.819" end="00:42:09.930" style="s2">told that we get a response no response</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.290" end="00:42:11.730" style="s2">no response notice never responded and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.930" end="00:42:12.920" style="s2">then when he was asked about somehow</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.730" end="00:42:16.230" style="s2">he&#39;s still the governor of Washington</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.920" end="00:42:19.020" style="s2">anyway he was asked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.230" end="00:42:21.690" style="s2">Capitol Hill autonomous zone in Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.020" end="00:42:24.150" style="s2">and he responded that he didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:26.700" style="s2">about it right which is an amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.150" end="00:42:28.680" style="s2">amazing claim but anyway we should talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.700" end="00:42:33.119" style="s2">about what the Capitol Hill autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.680" end="00:42:34.980" style="s2">zone actually means but let&#39;s just say</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.119" end="00:42:37.500" style="s2">that at the very least there&#39;s a battle</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.980" end="00:42:40.140" style="s2">over interpretation you&#39;ve got lots of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.500" end="00:42:45.210" style="s2">people claiming that the autonomous zone</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.140" end="00:42:47.790" style="s2">is is chaos it&#39;s Anarchy run amok is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.210" end="00:42:48.900" style="s2">anarchy well and that it&#39;s chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.790" end="00:42:50.040" style="s2">then you have other people claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.900" end="00:42:51.750" style="s2">it&#39;s being miss portrayed and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.040" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">actually a lovely place and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.750" end="00:42:55.470" style="s2">demonstrating everything it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:57.450" style="s2">demonstrate basically the police shut</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.470" end="00:42:59.309" style="s2">down their precinct and walked away you</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.450" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">could see this as it was happening I</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.309" end="00:43:02.309" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what the hell was going on I</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:04.170" style="s2">was watching aerial footage of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.309" end="00:43:06.299" style="s2">police taking their computers and things</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.170" end="00:43:08.339" style="s2">out of this building said what are they</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.299" end="00:43:15.750" style="s2">about to do but all right yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.339" end="00:43:20.520" style="s2">you show us that video from the no the</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.750" end="00:43:20.730" style="s2">other one who&#39;s kind of fit with it I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.520" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.730" end="00:43:24.750" style="s2">like me when I walk around anywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:27.450" style="s2">sweat like I have a glandular problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.750" end="00:43:29.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a horrifying condition I promise</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.450" end="00:43:32.339" style="s2">you nevertheless so this is where we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.869" end="00:43:34.140" style="s2">if you might recall again I&#39;ll tell the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.339" end="00:43:36.450" style="s2">story I tell remind you we were standing</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.140" end="00:43:38.520" style="s2">right over here by this fuck Trump sign</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.450" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">when they threw the fucking relays at us</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.520" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">and that was a fucking thing and so here</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:51.049" style="s2">it is this is just another wall of our</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:51.049" style="s2">art our our expression of our feelings</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.869" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">all right so that remarkable piece of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.759" end="00:44:26.329" style="s2">video I mean it starts out with him</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:27.739" style="s2">showing that in the Capitol Hill</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.329" end="00:44:31.339" style="s2">autonomous zone they should work the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.739" end="00:44:33.380" style="s2">arts and so there was a beautiful mural</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.339" end="00:44:36.829" style="s2">there I noticed a lot of sentiments were</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.380" end="00:44:38.119" style="s2">clearly expressed repeated for a greater</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.829" end="00:44:41.119" style="s2">artistic expression</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.119" end="00:44:42.199" style="s2">shoot shoot all of the police did it say</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.119" end="00:44:44.150" style="s2">that was good</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.199" end="00:44:45.499" style="s2">fuck 12 this is when I have can you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.150" end="00:44:47.449" style="s2">imagine how screwed we&#39;d be if they got</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.499" end="00:44:49.189" style="s2">rid of 12 I mean we&#39;re already in an</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.449" end="00:44:52.689" style="s2">awkward relationship with 13 they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.189" end="00:44:55.670" style="s2">gonna get rid of 12 now all right</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.689" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">by the way fuck 12 is about what is it</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.670" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s the letters of the alphabet 12 is</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.439" end="00:45:15.170" style="s2">yes 13 12 is a cab and 12 is the police</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.799" end="00:45:19.759" style="s2">so in any case the the person shooting</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.170" end="00:45:21.319" style="s2">this this mural is obviously relieved of</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.759" end="00:45:23.029" style="s2">his camera at which point he suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.319" end="00:45:25.939" style="s2">remembers that law and order heck</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.029" end="00:45:29.449" style="s2">actually has a positive effect as well</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.939" end="00:45:31.039" style="s2">as a negative one so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.449" end="00:45:33.079" style="s2">remarkable thing but lots of things are</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.039" end="00:45:35.719" style="s2">going on in the Capitol Hill autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.079" end="00:45:37.219" style="s2">zone including apparently extortion from</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.719" end="00:45:40.519" style="s2">the business owners they&#39;re being forced</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.219" end="00:45:45.709" style="s2">to tie the effectively pay protection to</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.519" end="00:45:48.229" style="s2">have their businesses not damaged but</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.709" end="00:45:49.999" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about the larger issue okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.229" end="00:45:52.039" style="s2">because what&#39;s really going on here I</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.999" end="00:45:54.199" style="s2">think now we don&#39;t know why it is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.039" end="00:45:56.029" style="s2">the police walked away from this</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.199" end="00:45:57.859" style="s2">neighborhood when they did but it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.029" end="00:46:00.049" style="s2">clearly planned mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.859" end="00:46:03.529" style="s2">my guess would be that they walked away</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.049" end="00:46:05.829" style="s2">in hopes that the protesters would do</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.529" end="00:46:08.749" style="s2">would run amok and that that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.829" end="00:46:09.320" style="s2">therefore explain to the world why the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.749" end="00:46:14.680" style="s2">police need</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.320" end="00:46:17.090" style="s2">to crack down I think the the protesters</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.680" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">realized that they had an opportunity on</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.090" end="00:46:21.590" style="s2">their hands and that opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.890" end="00:46:23.990" style="s2">involved if they can just restrain their</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.590" end="00:46:25.400" style="s2">impulses in this instance and if they</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.990" end="00:46:26.840" style="s2">can behave themselves it will</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.400" end="00:46:28.550" style="s2">demonstrate to the world that they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.840" end="00:46:29.930" style="s2">correct that you can just remove the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.550" end="00:46:31.850" style="s2">police and everything will be fine and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.930" end="00:46:33.890" style="s2">then suddenly that plan will start</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.850" end="00:46:36.800" style="s2">spreading at which point absolute mayhem</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.890" end="00:46:38.510" style="s2">is going to break out now they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.800" end="00:46:40.340" style="s2">doing a great job because of course the</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.510" end="00:46:42.200" style="s2">problem with trying to maintain your</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.340" end="00:46:44.060" style="s2">discipline when the police have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.200" end="00:46:46.130" style="s2">withdrawn is that it creates a power</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.060" end="00:46:48.020" style="s2">vacuum and bad people will take</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.130" end="00:46:52.360" style="s2">advantage of a power vacuum so what we</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.020" end="00:46:57.170" style="s2">have is R as Simone having come in and</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.360" end="00:47:00.320" style="s2">he is patrolling the thing with weapons</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.170" end="00:47:02.630" style="s2">and harassing people and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.320" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">becoming exactly like evergreen I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.630" end="00:47:08.600" style="s2">it&#39;s really evergreen 2.0 at greater</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:13.430" style="s2">scale with worse weapons and you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.600" end="00:47:15.020" style="s2">I&#39;d still say I&#39;m I&#39;m a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.430" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">impressed that it hasn&#39;t broken down</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.020" end="00:47:20.680" style="s2">worse faster but this is really where we</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:22.670" style="s2">are we&#39;re in a battle over</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.680" end="00:47:25.820" style="s2">interpretations of what is taking place</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.670" end="00:47:28.850" style="s2">if they can maintain message discipline</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.820" end="00:47:31.670" style="s2">so that the world sees basically a you</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.850" end="00:47:33.350" style="s2">know a kumbaya phenomenon going on there</p>

<p begin="00:47:33.350" end="00:47:37.970" style="s2">attempt to duplicate the success that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.870" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">demonstrated in the Capitol Hill</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.970" end="00:47:41.300" style="s2">autonomous zone elsewhere and it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:41.480" style="s2">other autonomous zones are now being set</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.300" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.480" end="00:47:47.210" style="s2">I believe in Portland one is being set</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">up and actually let&#39;s just cut to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.210" end="00:47:53.750" style="s2">chase what is this all really about so</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:55.850" style="s2">I&#39;m going to make a claim my claim is</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.750" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">going to be and I said this back when</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.850" end="00:48:01.880" style="s2">evergreen happened that the real plan</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:04.340" style="s2">actually let me step back this is two</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.880" end="00:48:05.690" style="s2">things that have come together okay this</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.340" end="00:48:07.670" style="s2">movement that we are seeing is two</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.690" end="00:48:10.280" style="s2">things come together one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.670" end="00:48:13.070" style="s2">occupied 2.0 and although we</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.280" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">participated in occupy occupy 2.0 I</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.070" end="00:48:17.390" style="s2">don&#39;t mean anything that I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:19.940" style="s2">remotely sign on to okay occupy started</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.390" end="00:48:22.670" style="s2">out as a complaint about the bias in our</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.940" end="00:48:23.270" style="s2">system started out as a complaint about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.670" end="00:48:25.070" style="s2">two big</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.270" end="00:48:26.750" style="s2">to fail which was used as an excuse to</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.070" end="00:48:28.040" style="s2">bail out the people who had caused the</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.750" end="00:48:30.830" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.040" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">you know the tarp program etc but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.830" end="00:48:36.410" style="s2">morphed into an anarchist nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:38.600" style="s2">it became foolish it lost its way this</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.410" end="00:48:40.970" style="s2">is now the 2.0 version of that anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.600" end="00:48:42.860" style="s2">nightmare and it is fused together with</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.970" end="00:48:45.530" style="s2">black lives matter black lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.860" end="00:48:47.150" style="s2">which is according to its slogan a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.530" end="00:48:49.220" style="s2">match for something important black</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.150" end="00:48:53.450" style="s2">lives are undervalued and I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.220" end="00:48:55.960" style="s2">is true we can see that based on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.450" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">failure to invests in black communities</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.960" end="00:49:00.560" style="s2">but these two things have come together</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:04.250" style="s2">an economic complaint about a rigged</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.560" end="00:49:06.950" style="s2">system that morphed into an anarchist</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.250" end="00:49:08.930" style="s2">nightmare and an actual complaint about</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.950" end="00:49:11.180" style="s2">real bias that is hard to put your</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.930" end="00:49:13.850" style="s2">finger on against black people that has</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.180" end="00:49:17.450" style="s2">now become an excuse for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.850" end="00:49:21.110" style="s2">other things and the plan that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.450" end="00:49:25.070" style="s2">unfolding is actually this reparations</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.110" end="00:49:27.550" style="s2">at all times in every venue right every</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.070" end="00:49:30.460" style="s2">interaction is going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.550" end="00:49:33.500" style="s2">reparation in it and the reparation is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.460" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">first and foremost about blacks but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.500" end="00:49:40.010" style="s2">really about the intersectional the you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:42.109" style="s2">will receive reparations on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.010" end="00:49:45.320" style="s2">where you fall intersectionally and as</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.109" end="00:49:47.210" style="s2">you have pointed out there are very real</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.320" end="00:49:49.940" style="s2">trans people who face very real</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.210" end="00:49:51.550" style="s2">obstacles in life but trans is the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.940" end="00:49:54.560" style="s2">place where you can opt into</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.550" end="00:49:56.270" style="s2">intersectional points so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.560" end="00:49:57.800" style="s2">movement proposing reparations</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.270" end="00:49:59.030" style="s2">everywhere and the reparations</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.800" end="00:50:02.869" style="s2">everywhere is a very frightening</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.030" end="00:50:04.369" style="s2">prospect because a you can&#39;t actual</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.869" end="00:50:06.140" style="s2">reparations program which I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.369" end="00:50:08.780" style="s2">favor but nonetheless is at least a</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.140" end="00:50:11.450" style="s2">coherent proposal that would be done</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.780" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">with society deciding to take resources</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.450" end="00:50:16.490" style="s2">and distribute them in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:19.030" style="s2">if it happens in every interaction it is</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.490" end="00:50:21.500" style="s2">the absolute destruction of meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.030" end="00:50:24.170" style="s2">so let&#39;s take a look at that other end</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.500" end="00:50:28.520" style="s2">of relationship of everything it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.170" end="00:50:32.109" style="s2">it&#39;s the inversion of decency it is just</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.520" end="00:50:36.440" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s see that other video ok I</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.109" end="00:50:40.280" style="s2">want you to find by the end by the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.440" end="00:50:44.380" style="s2">leave this autonomous cell I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.280" end="00:50:49.700" style="s2">give $10 to one african-american person</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.380" end="00:50:52.040" style="s2">from this autonomous zone and if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.700" end="00:50:55.099" style="s2">find that&#39;s difficult if you find this</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.040" end="00:50:57.800" style="s2">hard for you to give $10 to people of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.099" end="00:50:59.960" style="s2">color to black people especially you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.800" end="00:51:02.420" style="s2">have to think really critically about in</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.960" end="00:51:05.390" style="s2">the future are you gonna actually give</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.420" end="00:51:07.430" style="s2">up power and land and capital when you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.390" end="00:51:10.099" style="s2">have it if you&#39;re if you have a hard</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.430" end="00:51:12.349" style="s2">time giving up $10 you guys think about</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.099" end="00:51:14.810" style="s2">are you really down with this struggle</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.349" end="00:51:17.150" style="s2">are you really down with the movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.810" end="00:51:19.339" style="s2">because if that is a challenge for you</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.150" end="00:51:23.000" style="s2">then I&#39;m unsure if you&#39;re in the right</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.339" end="00:51:25.609" style="s2">place so fine an african-american person</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.000" end="00:51:28.910" style="s2">the white people I see you I see every</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.609" end="00:51:32.359" style="s2">single one of you and I remember your</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.910" end="00:51:35.450" style="s2">faces you find that african-american</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.359" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">person and you give them $10 cash app</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.450" end="00:51:44.300" style="s2">then month ten dollars in your pocket</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:48.589" style="s2">that&#39;s my challenge to you do it all</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.300" end="00:51:51.050" style="s2">right so that video contains a lot one</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.589" end="00:51:53.089" style="s2">thing is the reaction of people when</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.050" end="00:51:55.310" style="s2">they are actually asked to hand over</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.089" end="00:51:57.380" style="s2">money individually is much less</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.310" end="00:52:00.650" style="s2">enthusiastic when then when they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.380" end="00:52:02.510" style="s2">trying to force other people to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.650" end="00:52:06.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not surprising at all from a game</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.510" end="00:52:08.410" style="s2">theoretic perspective but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.650" end="00:52:12.740" style="s2">really need to just understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.410" end="00:52:15.950" style="s2">proposals are so insane so dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.740" end="00:52:18.530" style="s2">that we have to not take them seriously</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.950" end="00:52:20.420" style="s2">we have to understand that even if the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.530" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">movement is motivated by actual</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.420" end="00:52:24.710" style="s2">frustration about really really</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:30.589" style="s2">important things that the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.710" end="00:52:34.040" style="s2">is basically threatening to scuttle the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.589" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">entire operation for no reason so</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.040" end="00:52:40.030" style="s2">imagine for a second what the world</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:44.780" style="s2">would look like if if this movement</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.030" end="00:52:47.750" style="s2">succeeds in advancing its vision what</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.780" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">does law-and-order look like going</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.750" end="00:52:51.180" style="s2">forward under</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:53.930" style="s2">the you know the world after the police</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.180" end="00:52:57.030" style="s2">have been disbanded can you show the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.930" end="00:53:00.329" style="s2">proposals the the demands that were</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.030" end="00:53:05.760" style="s2">issued from the Capitol Hill autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.329" end="00:53:09.329" style="s2">zone I sent it to you well we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.760" end="00:53:12.839" style="s2">about what they were so the demands the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.329" end="00:53:15.180" style="s2">long list of demands you know remove</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.839" end="00:53:17.190" style="s2">signature move long list of demands and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.180" end="00:53:19.109" style="s2">then I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen this list</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.190" end="00:53:20.849" style="s2">yet but often at the top of the list is</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.109" end="00:53:22.410" style="s2">a demand to be able to take as many much</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.849" end="00:53:25.800" style="s2">time as you want to make further demands</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.809" end="00:53:42.109" style="s2">diminutive couch I&#39;m sure um okay but on</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.069" end="00:53:46.109" style="s2">this list yeah you can put it up so</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.109" end="00:53:48.089" style="s2">scroll down look and if you&#39;re the top</p>

<p begin="00:53:58.140" end="00:54:01.380" style="s2">historical moment we will begin with our</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.490" end="00:54:02.790" style="s2">demands pertaining to the justice system</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.380" end="00:54:05.339" style="s2">the Seattle Police Department</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.790" end="00:54:08.450" style="s2">and attached court system are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.339" end="00:54:11.280" style="s2">reform we do not request reform we</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.450" end="00:54:12.930" style="s2">demand abolition most of the police and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.280" end="00:54:15.420" style="s2">the court system it&#39;s literally both law</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.930" end="00:54:18.230" style="s2">and order that they demand abolitionists</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.420" end="00:54:23.549" style="s2">believe me it is both law and order as</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.230" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">they also demand further down if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.549" end="00:54:29.099" style="s2">scroll down there&#39;s a highlight oh</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:32.460" style="s2">there&#39;s the highlight we demand retrial</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.099" end="00:54:35.099" style="s2">of all people of color currently serving</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.460" end="00:54:37.619" style="s2">a prison sentence for violent crime by a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.099" end="00:54:41.250" style="s2">jury of their peers in their community</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.619" end="00:54:43.470" style="s2">so they would like to retry all people</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.250" end="00:54:44.640" style="s2">of color yes there so this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.470" end="00:54:46.859" style="s2">time I&#39;m seeing this are they demanding</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.640" end="00:54:48.750" style="s2">a retrial for people of color who were</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.859" end="00:54:50.220" style="s2">serving sentences for nonviolent crime</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.750" end="00:54:51.329" style="s2">or just those who were serving sentences</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.220" end="00:54:53.730" style="s2">for violent crime that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.329" end="00:54:56.369" style="s2">extraordinary demand right there it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.730" end="00:54:58.410" style="s2">stands alone without a demand for</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.369" end="00:54:59.970" style="s2">retrial of people who actually were</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.410" end="00:55:01.150" style="s2">found guilty of committing non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.970" end="00:55:04.300" style="s2">crime</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.150" end="00:55:06.130" style="s2">if I remember correctly they delayed</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.300" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">offenses yeah they demanded a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.130" end="00:55:11.050" style="s2">number of people be just simply released</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:13.240" style="s2">which you know in the case of marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.050" end="00:55:16.859" style="s2">nonviolent marijuana offenses I&#39;d be all</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.240" end="00:55:18.730" style="s2">for that but but in any case they are</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.859" end="00:55:19.300" style="s2">proposing oh I mean imagine how this</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.730" end="00:55:23.670" style="s2">would look</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.300" end="00:55:27.670" style="s2">okay you start retrying people of color</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.670" end="00:55:31.710" style="s2">who are currently serving a prison</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.670" end="00:55:33.330" style="s2">sentence for violent crime right</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.710" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">how fair do we think these trials would</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.330" end="00:55:37.050" style="s2">be they have no chance of being fair</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:39.300" style="s2">right now well they have no chance of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.050" end="00:55:42.020" style="s2">being fair right now they&#39;re certainly</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.300" end="00:55:45.210" style="s2">going to be a bias in favor of assuming</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.020" end="00:55:46.619" style="s2">that there was so much bias in the first</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.210" end="00:55:50.940" style="s2">trial that it should probably be</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.619" end="00:55:52.830" style="s2">overturned right but also you know they</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.940" end="00:55:55.140" style="s2">effectively I mean elsewhere I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.830" end="00:55:57.140" style="s2">just the advocacy for the complete</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.140" end="00:56:00.510" style="s2">ablution abolition of the prison system</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.140" end="00:56:02.580" style="s2">so we&#39;re talking about a turning a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.510" end="00:56:05.760" style="s2">of very dangerous people is actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.580" end="00:56:08.790" style="s2">dangerous people who in many cases may</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.760" end="00:56:11.550" style="s2">be psychopathic may not be in any way</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.790" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">recoverable right so at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.550" end="00:56:14.190" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about eliminating the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:16.190" style="s2">police so the mechanism that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.190" end="00:56:20.280" style="s2">disincentivize those people from</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.190" end="00:56:24.420" style="s2">harassing murdering everybody you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.280" end="00:56:27.480" style="s2">anybody who resists but they also might</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.420" end="00:56:30.720" style="s2">generate themselves effectively an army</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.480" end="00:56:33.270" style="s2">in other words given the tenor of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.720" end="00:56:35.640" style="s2">moment I would imagine that your chances</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.270" end="00:56:37.910" style="s2">of being exonerated in a retrial would</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.640" end="00:56:40.890" style="s2">have a lot to do with whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.910" end="00:56:46.950" style="s2">said the right kinds of things about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.890" end="00:56:48.450" style="s2">movement and it&#39;s its necessity so ok</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.950" end="00:56:55.050" style="s2">you can take that you can take that down</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.450" end="00:57:03.480" style="s2">now Zak ok so anyway the basic point I</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.050" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">guess is the proposals are not if they</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.480" end="00:57:09.900" style="s2">were advanced in a brainstorming session</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:13.830" style="s2">about how civilization might be remade</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.900" end="00:57:16.349" style="s2">they would be immediately shot down on</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.830" end="00:57:20.339" style="s2">the basis that they are not tenable and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.349" end="00:57:23.160" style="s2">the people who advanced such terrible</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.339" end="00:57:26.670" style="s2">dangerous ideas would lose credibility</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.160" end="00:57:28.890" style="s2">in in in an honest brainstorming session</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.670" end="00:57:31.109" style="s2">about civilization and the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.890" end="00:57:33.300" style="s2">don&#39;t have the power to do that has to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.109" end="00:57:36.180" style="s2">do only with the social incentives</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.300" end="00:57:37.470" style="s2">surrounding this moment right anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.180" end="00:57:39.930" style="s2">that points in one direction is</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.470" end="00:57:42.630" style="s2">considered not only legitimate but</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.930" end="00:57:44.339" style="s2">obvious and important and anything that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.630" end="00:57:45.010" style="s2">goes in the other direction is presumed</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.339" end="00:57:48.330" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.010" end="00:57:50.620" style="s2">null and void and the result of pure</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.330" end="00:57:54.370" style="s2">racism it&#39;s such a simple game</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.620" end="00:57:56.890" style="s2">so obviously game upon and yet those of</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.370" end="00:57:58.390" style="s2">us who are saying just that are because</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.890" end="00:58:00.760" style="s2">we are all within this game that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.390" end="00:58:03.610" style="s2">never wanted to play so easily accused</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.760" end="00:58:07.000" style="s2">of by simply saying that we must be</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.610" end="00:58:09.340" style="s2">doing so by reason of racism all you</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.000" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">have to do is cloak something in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.340" end="00:58:12.940" style="s2">language of black lives matter or shut</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:15.580" style="s2">down stem or whatever it is whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.940" end="00:58:17.710" style="s2">tagline is at the moment and you can get</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.580" end="00:58:19.900" style="s2">away with almost anything else you can</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.710" end="00:58:22.170" style="s2">slip in almost anything else as long as</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.900" end="00:58:24.580" style="s2">it fits generally under that guise and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.170" end="00:58:26.380" style="s2">anything that runs counter you you are</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.580" end="00:58:29.620" style="s2">not allowed to investigate to think</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.380" end="00:58:33.750" style="s2">about to consider so then the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.620" end="00:58:38.500" style="s2">is I find us in a very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.750" end="00:58:41.830" style="s2">predicament which is ok we&#39;re beginning</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.500" end="00:58:44.080" style="s2">to figure out we&#39;re beginning to be able</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.830" end="00:58:46.600" style="s2">to discuss just how preposterous the</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.080" end="00:58:49.000" style="s2">movement is which does not mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.600" end="00:58:51.490" style="s2">fuel that is driving it isn&#39;t based on</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.000" end="00:58:53.680" style="s2">something very important all right the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.490" end="00:58:56.950" style="s2">frustration about an economic system</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.680" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">that is rigged against many people</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.950" end="00:59:00.610" style="s2">that&#39;s rated against Millennials through</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:04.540" style="s2">debt it&#39;s rigged against certain</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.610" end="00:59:07.480" style="s2">populations based on where you where you</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.540" end="00:59:10.570" style="s2">are born and grow up what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.480" end="00:59:13.300" style="s2">schools are there the frustration is</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.570" end="00:59:15.670" style="s2">real it is bewildering to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.300" end="00:59:18.550" style="s2">either you it seems to be that either</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.670" end="00:59:20.650" style="s2">you land on the I&#39;m in favor of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.550" end="00:59:23.650" style="s2">protests side and therefore I accept</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.650" end="00:59:26.230" style="s2">their discussion of what has taken place</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.650" end="00:59:27.640" style="s2">and what should happen now or I reject</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.230" end="00:59:30.040" style="s2">these protests and I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.640" end="00:59:33.850" style="s2">this is unfair I believe civilization is</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.040" end="00:59:36.220" style="s2">pretty fair and I&#39;m not listening the</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.850" end="00:59:39.160" style="s2">right position is in the space that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.220" end="00:59:41.260" style="s2">not existed until now or has struggled</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.160" end="00:59:44.860" style="s2">to exist and so far failed to get a</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.260" end="00:59:47.800" style="s2">foothold which is how can we discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.860" end="00:59:50.740" style="s2">actual problem without embracing this</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.800" end="00:59:55.270" style="s2">lunacy and it is lunacy the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.740" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">removing the police is that is basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.270" end="01:00:04.150" style="s2">a gun to the head of the Republic</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="01:00:06.190" style="s2">so I think Sam did an excellent job of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.150" end="01:00:08.210" style="s2">extending the Overton Window</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.190" end="01:00:11.240" style="s2">statistically speaking so that we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.210" end="01:00:13.609" style="s2">look at the claim of lethal police</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.240" end="01:00:17.060" style="s2">violence and whether or not it appears</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.609" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">to be racially motivated Eric put out a</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.060" end="01:00:21.560" style="s2">very interesting essay at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:22.550" style="s2">of his most recent portal I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.560" end="01:00:23.930" style="s2">listened to the whole thing so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.550" end="01:00:25.369" style="s2">recommend the whole episode yet because</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.930" end="01:00:27.829" style="s2">I never do that if I haven&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.369" end="01:00:30.680" style="s2">but but anyway the essay at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.829" end="01:00:32.060" style="s2">beginning is quite excellent yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.680" end="01:00:35.349" style="s2">it&#39;s about something he talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.060" end="01:00:38.750" style="s2">when he was on the Dark Horse podcast</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.349" end="01:00:41.180" style="s2">several days ago the culture of</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.750" end="01:00:44.990" style="s2">meritocracy inside the black community</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.180" end="01:00:50.210" style="s2">which is a very interesting topic these</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.990" end="01:00:52.160" style="s2">are four rays into the no man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.210" end="01:00:54.650" style="s2">that exists between the two wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.160" end="01:00:56.510" style="s2">perspectives civilization is fair and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.650" end="01:00:59.930" style="s2">civilization is so biased that we have</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.510" end="01:01:03.109" style="s2">to pull the plug on it right the forays</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.930" end="01:01:04.849" style="s2">are really important we have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.109" end="01:01:06.560" style="s2">out how to discuss these things we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.849" end="01:01:08.030" style="s2">to figure out how to protect people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.560" end="01:01:09.800" style="s2">do discuss these things even when</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.030" end="01:01:11.450" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong they have to be protected</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.800" end="01:01:13.490" style="s2">so that they have the ability to explore</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.450" end="01:01:17.930" style="s2">without being immediately blown up for</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.490" end="01:01:22.339" style="s2">making an error right and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.930" end="01:01:26.030" style="s2">iconic example is Dave Chappelle I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.339" end="01:01:28.880" style="s2">I sort of feel like it&#39;s great that an</p>

<p begin="01:01:28.880" end="01:01:33.890" style="s2">frustration clearly right he clearly</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.369" end="01:01:39.290" style="s2">gets the real problem and who has gained</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.890" end="01:01:41.020" style="s2">the trust of so many people if he can be</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.290" end="01:01:44.270" style="s2">compelled that actually there is a way</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.020" end="01:01:47.119" style="s2">that this story does add up that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.270" end="01:01:50.359" style="s2">one of these two other versions that</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.119" end="01:01:55.970" style="s2">will be that will be a huge gain for all</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.359" end="01:01:58.940" style="s2">of us yeah yeah well we&#39;re at about an</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.970" end="01:02:02.569" style="s2">hour about an hour we&#39;re at four now I</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.940" end="01:02:05.190" style="s2">think that&#39;s where we&#39;re at for now okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.569" end="01:02:09.549" style="s2">so we wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.190" end="01:02:13.569" style="s2">so it&#39;d make a couple of say couple of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.549" end="01:02:17.470" style="s2">things about changes that are afoot we</p>
