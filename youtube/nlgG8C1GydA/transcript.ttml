<p begin="00:01:35.590" end="00:01:40.899" style="s2">inflection point where do we start there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.780" end="00:01:43.570" style="s2">what is the inflection point well I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.899" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">think we&#39;re deciding we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.570" end="00:01:47.320" style="s2">decide if there&#39;s such a thing as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.320" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">future that&#39;s what it looks like to me I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:56.950" style="s2">mean on the one hand we&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">tremendous technological progress in all</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.950" end="00:02:02.110" style="s2">sorts of directions simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.909" style="s2">that seems to be having mostly positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.110" end="00:02:06.369" style="s2">effects especially economically</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.909" end="00:02:09.670" style="s2">especially on a global scale and on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.369" end="00:02:12.549" style="s2">other hand we seem more confused about</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.670" end="00:02:14.110" style="s2">are the foundations of our culture and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.549" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">the potential directions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.110" end="00:02:18.690" style="s2">moving in than we have been for a while</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:21.820" style="s2">and that seems especially acute in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.690" end="00:02:24.040" style="s2">educational institutions and that seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.820" end="00:02:25.660" style="s2">to be a consequence of the constant</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.040" end="00:02:28.750" style="s2">cultural critique that&#39;s been generated</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.660" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">I would say mostly on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.750" end="00:02:34.790" style="s2">postmodern edge edge of the academic</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:39.409" style="s2">what would you say academic</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.409" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">out what&#39;s next when what do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:50.989" style="s2">offer to students all of that mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:54.700" style="s2">know that it was that this yesterday was</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.989" end="00:02:58.329" style="s2">published the 50th anniversary edition</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.700" end="00:03:03.319" style="s2">of Sol&#39;s nichkhun&#39;s Gulag Archipelago</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">suppose the question I have there is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.500" end="00:03:19.819" style="s2">why is that so important</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:24.069" style="s2">well the book was important because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.819" end="00:03:27.409" style="s2">was the first it was the first work that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.069" end="00:03:31.069" style="s2">succeeded in undermining the Marxist</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.069" end="00:03:37.939" style="s2">perspective simultaneously I mean other</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.379" end="00:03:40.699" style="s2">people had pointed out the terror of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.699" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">George Orwell among others often people</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.010" end="00:03:48.919" style="s2">on the Left interestingly enough but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:50.269" style="s2">was always possible right up until the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.919" end="00:03:52.720" style="s2">end of the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.269" end="00:03:55.729" style="s2">for the people who held on to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.720" end="00:03:58.909" style="s2">collectivist utopian dream in the West</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.729" end="00:04:00.859" style="s2">to rationalize what had happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.909" end="00:04:04.669" style="s2">Soviet Union partly by sweeping it under</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.859" end="00:04:07.370" style="s2">the rug but also partly by while using</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.669" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">the old adage that you can&#39;t make an</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.370" end="00:04:13.009" style="s2">omelet without breaking a few eggs it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:15.799" style="s2">became obvious by the end of the 1960&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.009" end="00:04:18.949" style="s2">that the omelet wasn&#39;t very well</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.799" end="00:04:21.590" style="s2">prepared and that millions of eggs so to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.949" end="00:04:24.889" style="s2">speak to belabor a metaphor had been</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.590" end="00:04:28.909" style="s2">broken and so when Solzhenitsyn wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.889" end="00:04:33.889" style="s2">his great book it became impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.909" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">anyone who was willing to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.889" end="00:04:39.259" style="s2">cultural moment to ignore the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.680" end="00:04:41.090" style="s2">something had gone dreadfully sideways</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.259" end="00:04:43.070" style="s2">and that it couldn&#39;t be attributed</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.090" end="00:04:45.310" style="s2">merely to a cult of personality or to</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.070" end="00:04:47.450" style="s2">some abnormality that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.310" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">intrinsically part of the doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.450" end="00:04:49.880" style="s2">itself and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">that was partly what soldier</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.880" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn revealed about the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">Union as such but at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:59.510" style="s2">evidence that precisely the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:01.760" style="s2">had been happening in places like Maoist</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.510" end="00:05:04.220" style="s2">China perhaps to even a larger degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.760" end="00:05:07.190" style="s2">well undoubtedly to a larger degree and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.220" end="00:05:11.690" style="s2">then in Cambodia and all the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.190" end="00:05:16.130" style="s2">places where Marxism produced utterly</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.690" end="00:05:19.790" style="s2">murderous consequences and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.130" end="00:05:23.720" style="s2">the book that did that and it made</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.790" end="00:05:25.400" style="s2">Marxism morally repugnant you know it</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.720" end="00:05:28.430" style="s2">was also one of the events that</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.400" end="00:05:30.170" style="s2">catalyzed the transformation of Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.430" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">into identity politics as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.170" end="00:05:34.910" style="s2">concerned because a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:38.180" style="s2">who held the the victim victimizer</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.910" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">narrative as sacrosanct that that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.180" end="00:05:42.470" style="s2">the appropriate way to look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:45.200" style="s2">to divide people into identity groups of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.470" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">whatever form and then to see history as</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.200" end="00:05:51.740" style="s2">the battle between them history the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.770" end="00:05:54.380" style="s2">present and the future that that trends</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.740" end="00:05:56.840" style="s2">that transmuted especially in France</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.380" end="00:06:00.080" style="s2">because even though the Marxists had</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.840" end="00:06:02.979" style="s2">been unmasked the murderous nosov the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.080" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">doctrine had been unmasked that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.979" end="00:06:07.190" style="s2">the people who&#39;d held that doctrine were</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">still looking for the easiest lateral</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.190" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">move and so that was one of the driving</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:14.150" style="s2">forces for the development of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:15.890" style="s2">post-modernism not the only one it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.150" end="00:06:18.380" style="s2">post modernists that are also figured</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.380" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">that really is an intractable problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.600" end="00:06:24.800" style="s2">they ran across the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:26.540" style="s2">categorization and that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.800" end="00:06:28.100" style="s2">happened in multiple disciplines at the</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.580" end="00:06:41.210" style="s2">very difficult to perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">because objects aren&#39;t just there for</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.310" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">turns out to be a virtually impossible</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:21.330" style="s2">in the West said like it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.320" end="00:09:24.780" style="s2">very important that we have a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.330" end="00:09:26.700" style="s2">of what the the governing assumptions of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.780" end="00:09:28.770" style="s2">our culture are or it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.700" end="00:09:30.870" style="s2">transcend them yeah well that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.770" end="00:09:32.700" style="s2">the issue because the question is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.870" end="00:09:35.370" style="s2">whether or not the past is over I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.700" end="00:09:38.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a Marx a Marxist philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.370" end="00:09:41.430" style="s2">named Richard Wolff who challenged me</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.760" end="00:09:43.950" style="s2">recently on YouTube to a a debate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.430" end="00:09:47.430" style="s2">really the answer that I posted was this</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.950" end="00:09:50.130" style="s2">forward and he accused me of being stuck</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.430" end="00:09:53.010" style="s2">in the past you know it&#39;s well the you</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.130" end="00:09:55.530" style="s2">know the The Wall fell in 1989 and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.010" end="00:09:58.620" style="s2">horrors of the Soviet era are over and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.530" end="00:10:01.440" style="s2">we we can&#39;t paint</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.620" end="00:10:04.260" style="s2">we can&#39;t eternally tar Marxism with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.440" end="00:10:08.130" style="s2">brush of these past events I mean as if</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.260" end="00:10:10.530" style="s2">these events are over or as if 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.130" end="00:10:13.680" style="s2">is sufficient time to forget about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.530" end="00:10:16.050" style="s2">corpses but that&#39;s his idea you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">to me it&#39;s the same idea that you might</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.050" end="00:10:20.730" style="s2">put forward if you were a neo-nazi</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:23.700" style="s2">by saying that well you know all that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.730" end="00:10:25.830" style="s2">happened back in 1945 the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.700" end="00:10:28.550" style="s2">doctrine was sound and we can&#39;t allow</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.830" end="00:10:31.110" style="s2">our judgement about these eternal truths</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.550" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">manifested in the National Socialist</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.110" end="00:10:36.180" style="s2">doctrine to be forever tainted by some</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">unfortunate historical events and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.180" end="00:10:40.560" style="s2">think that that&#39;s just well I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:42.180" style="s2">know what to say about it I mean one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.560" end="00:10:44.370" style="s2">the telling things about his comments</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.180" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">was that he only talked about the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.370" end="00:10:48.570" style="s2">Union and not all the other terrible</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:50.400" style="s2">places that the same doctrine had been</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.570" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">implemented with equally murderous</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.400" end="00:10:55.860" style="s2">effects and so that was quite the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:57.900" style="s2">argument by evasion but I what I tried</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.860" end="00:10:59.820" style="s2">to do in the foreword and in my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.900" end="00:11:02.220" style="s2">in general is I&#39;m always trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.820" end="00:11:05.280" style="s2">to the bottom of things what&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.220" end="00:11:07.290" style="s2">bottom and it seems to me that what</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.280" end="00:11:09.810" style="s2">happened if you look at what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.290" end="00:11:11.160" style="s2">the Russian Revolution like the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.810" end="00:11:13.650" style="s2">thing you want to do is give the devil</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.160" end="00:11:15.870" style="s2">is do ok and the way you do that is by</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.650" end="00:11:17.820" style="s2">pointing out that hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.870" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">structures no well we&#39;ll start even</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.820" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">before that people have problems that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:25.350" style="s2">have to be solved life is a sequence of</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:27.150" style="s2">problems that have to be solved if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.350" end="00:11:29.220" style="s2">don&#39;t solve the problems that life puts</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.150" end="00:11:30.060" style="s2">forward you suffer and you die so</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.220" end="00:11:32.070" style="s2">assuming the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.060" end="00:11:33.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t want those two outcomes then</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.070" end="00:11:37.080" style="s2">there are problems you have to solve and</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.720" end="00:11:39.000" style="s2">and so you have to set a name and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.080" end="00:11:40.770" style="s2">aim is to solve the problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.000" end="00:11:42.930" style="s2">because we&#39;re social creatures we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.770" end="00:11:44.670" style="s2">to solve the problems by organizing</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.930" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">collectively and the way we do that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.670" end="00:11:48.840" style="s2">generally speaking in relationship to an</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.790" style="s2">aim is to produce a hierarchy and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.840" end="00:11:52.740" style="s2">reason for that is that if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.790" end="00:11:54.630" style="s2">problem and you want it to be solved and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.740" end="00:11:56.550" style="s2">you get a variety of people working on</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.630" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">it you&#39;re soon going to discover that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.550" end="00:11:59.490" style="s2">some people are much better at solving</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:01.320" style="s2">the problem than others and that will</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.490" end="00:12:04.770" style="s2">inevitably produce a hierarchy and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.320" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">should because then the even the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.770" end="00:12:11.940" style="s2">structure of authority is is in sync</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.410" style="s2">with the aim and the aim is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.940" end="00:12:15.930" style="s2">because it&#39;s a problem that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.410" end="00:12:17.070" style="s2">agrees that is an actual problem so</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.930" end="00:12:18.810" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.070" end="00:12:20.700" style="s2">organizations and you should now the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.810" end="00:12:22.770" style="s2">problem with that is that as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.700" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">produce a hierarchical organization two</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.770" end="00:12:26.790" style="s2">things happen one is that a small</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">minority of the people do almost all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.790" end="00:12:30.060" style="s2">creative work that&#39;s the period of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.100" style="s2">principal and the other is that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.060" end="00:12:33.990" style="s2">benefits of the hierarchy flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.100" end="00:12:36.810" style="s2">disproportionately to a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.990" end="00:12:38.340" style="s2">people at the top so and that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.810" end="00:12:39.780" style="s2">manifestation of the Prix de principle</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.340" end="00:12:41.580" style="s2">and it is something that Marx pointed</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.780" end="00:12:43.830" style="s2">out although he blamed it on capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.580" end="00:12:46.680" style="s2">which which is a big mistake even if</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.830" end="00:12:49.080" style="s2">you&#39;re concerned for those the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.680" end="00:12:51.780" style="s2">dispossesses so you produce a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.080" end="00:12:53.550" style="s2">both the work the work flows from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.780" end="00:12:55.170" style="s2">minority of people and the benefits flow</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.550" end="00:12:57.150" style="s2">to a minority of people and those might</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.170" end="00:12:58.950" style="s2">not be the same people by the way right</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.150" end="00:13:01.230" style="s2">because hierarchies aren&#39;t perfect in</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.950" end="00:13:04.500" style="s2">their ability to distribute resources as</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.230" end="00:13:06.180" style="s2">a consequence of productive effort</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.500" end="00:13:09.150" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:11.370" style="s2">hierarchical organizations but then what</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.150" end="00:13:13.830" style="s2">the hierarchy does is produce a layer of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.370" end="00:13:16.080" style="s2">the dispossessed that stack up at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.830" end="00:13:18.600" style="s2">bottom near zero and it&#39;s the majority</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.080" end="00:13:20.610" style="s2">it&#39;s always the majority so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.600" end="00:13:23.250" style="s2">price you pay for hierarchies now what</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.610" end="00:13:26.190" style="s2">the left does is say look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.250" end="00:13:28.020" style="s2">dispossessed and keep the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.190" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">flexible enough so that it can twist and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.020" end="00:13:31.590" style="s2">Bend and transform when necessary but</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:34.410" style="s2">also so that the dispossessed don&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.590" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">so close to zero that they that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.610" end="00:13:45.700" style="s2">structure doesn&#39;t become so untenable</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.780" end="00:13:47.890" style="s2">that it destroys itself because of the</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.890" end="00:13:51.820" style="s2">propositions and so then you could say</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.050" end="00:13:53.800" style="s2">well there&#39;s a certain number of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.820" end="00:13:58.090" style="s2">on the Left who are genuinely motivated</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.800" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">by concern about dispossession as well</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:04.120" style="s2">that&#39;s to give the devil his due and so</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.290" end="00:14:06.340" style="s2">then you might say well there was moral</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.120" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">reasons there were moral reasons for at</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.340" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">least a subset of those who were</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.980" end="00:14:16.180" style="s2">the dispossessed but there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.930" end="00:14:17.980" style="s2">and this is the problem of the left</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.180" end="00:14:19.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem so on the right as</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.980" end="00:14:21.520" style="s2">well the problem on the right is once</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.900" end="00:14:23.230" style="s2">the higher arc is established those who</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.520" end="00:14:25.390" style="s2">dominate the top have every right to</p>

<p begin="00:14:27.580" end="00:14:32.140" style="s2">particular on the left the problem is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.160" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s not easy to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.140" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2">between care for the dispossessed and</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.870" end="00:14:41.350" style="s2">well you could say Authority the</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.350" end="00:14:45.310" style="s2">you could also say competence which i</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.420" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">think is more to the case or ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.310" end="00:14:50.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not easy to distinguish care for</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:14:57.790" style="s2">the hierarchy and if it&#39;s power than its</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:15:00.640" style="s2">hatred for power but if it&#39;s competence</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.790" end="00:15:02.350" style="s2">and it is competence if the hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.640" end="00:15:04.390" style="s2">functional then its hatred for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.350" end="00:15:06.070" style="s2">competent okay then you say all right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.390" end="00:15:08.260" style="s2">those are the two competing motivations</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.070" end="00:15:11.440" style="s2">care for the dispossessed and hatred for</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.260" end="00:15:13.630" style="s2">the let&#39;s say competent let&#39;s play that</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.440" end="00:15:15.850" style="s2">out historically speaking and see which</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.630" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">is the more powerful force well that got</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.850" end="00:15:20.620" style="s2">played out very rapidly in the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:23.650" style="s2">Revolution and what happened was even if</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.620" end="00:15:26.140" style="s2">there was a a minority and perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.650" end="00:15:27.910" style="s2">a majority although there wasn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.140" end="00:15:30.070" style="s2">perhaps even a majority of those who</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.910" end="00:15:32.970" style="s2">truly cared for the dispossessed those</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.070" end="00:15:35.800" style="s2">who hated the competent slaughtered them</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.970" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">it turned out that the hatred was a much</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.800" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">more potent geopolitical force than the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:46.030" style="s2">compassion and then and another twist</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.910" end="00:15:49.270" style="s2">occurred too because the the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.030" end="00:15:50.920" style="s2">was burrs huazi against proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.270" end="00:15:52.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say and so that&#39;s those at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.920" end="00:15:54.100" style="s2">uppermost pinnacle of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.420" end="00:15:56.020" style="s2">against those who the dispossessed and</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.100" end="00:15:57.790" style="s2">that was also the historical narrative</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.020" end="00:15:59.710" style="s2">and then it was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.790" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">right and responsibility of those who</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.710" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">were oppressed to rise up but that ran</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:06.520" style="s2">into another problem which is basically</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.820" end="00:20:08.710" style="s2">responsibility so those are really the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.340" end="00:20:12.970" style="s2">two reasons for that the individual has</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.710" end="00:20:14.919" style="s2">to be made primary but and and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.970" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">divinity element of the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.919" end="00:20:19.389" style="s2">this I think is coded in our deepest</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:21.250" style="s2">stories it&#39;s really deeply coded in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.389" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">Genesis particularly in the opening</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.250" end="00:20:26.620" style="s2">chapters of opening verses of Genesis is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:28.990" style="s2">that what human-beings confront in their</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.620" end="00:20:31.150" style="s2">lives is akin to what God Himself</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.990" end="00:20:34.840" style="s2">confronted at the beginning of time and</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.150" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s easy for us to believe that were</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.840" end="00:20:40.059" style="s2">deterministic creatures like clocks and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">and that it&#39;s the past that drives us</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.059" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">forward in a deterministic manner into</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:46.750" style="s2">the future but I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:51.549" style="s2">because people are so complex you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.419" end="00:20:53.559" style="s2">actually can&#39;t predict them as if</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.549" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">they&#39;re deterministic except in in very</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.559" end="00:20:57.490" style="s2">constrained circumstances and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:02.020" style="s2">hypothesis but it&#39;s not a very good one</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.490" end="00:21:02.980" style="s2">and although it has its utility what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.020" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.980" end="00:21:07.240" style="s2">what seems to me to be the case and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:09.340" style="s2">think this is how people conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.240" end="00:21:11.650" style="s2">themselves and how they act towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.340" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">themselves and towards other people and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.650" end="00:21:17.320" style="s2">how our social structures our political</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.320" end="00:21:23.080" style="s2">beings constantly confront a landscape</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.260" end="00:21:24.970" style="s2">of possibility its potential itself and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.080" end="00:21:27.760" style="s2">and we have a belief in the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.970" end="00:21:30.460" style="s2">potential we have an idea that there are</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.760" end="00:21:32.049" style="s2">things that could be it&#39;s a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.460" end="00:21:34.600" style="s2">conception of reality because it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.049" end="00:21:36.460" style="s2">materialistic conception because things</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.600" end="00:21:38.919" style="s2">that could be aren&#39;t measurable in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.460" end="00:21:41.890" style="s2">sense right but we certainly act as if</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.919" end="00:21:46.500" style="s2">they exist and we all treat each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.890" end="00:21:50.169" style="s2">as if our one of our fundamental ethical</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.500" end="00:21:52.210" style="s2">requirements is for you to confront that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.169" end="00:21:54.280" style="s2">potential properly and that would be to</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.210" end="00:21:57.900" style="s2">live up to your responsibility it is you</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.280" end="00:22:00.190" style="s2">have these gifts and talents and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.900" end="00:22:03.070" style="s2">possibilities that have been granted to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.190" end="00:22:06.130" style="s2">you and if you fail to make use of them</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.070" end="00:22:09.700" style="s2">your talents let&#39;s say then that&#39;s a sin</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.130" end="00:22:11.049" style="s2">of sorts and that&#39;s a religious way of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.700" end="00:22:12.580" style="s2">thinking about it but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.049" end="00:22:14.700" style="s2">because that&#39;s how people treat each</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.580" end="00:22:18.490" style="s2">other if you have a child for example or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.700" end="00:22:21.429" style="s2">a spouse or a friend brother to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.490" end="00:22:24.280" style="s2">you care about and you see you have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.429" end="00:22:26.530" style="s2">intuition that they could be making more</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.280" end="00:22:28.870" style="s2">of themselves and what they have then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.530" end="00:22:30.250" style="s2">they are then you&#39;re deeply disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.870" end="00:22:32.200" style="s2">in that and the reason you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.250" end="00:22:36.370" style="s2">disappointed in that is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.200" end="00:22:38.020" style="s2">a call to us an existential call to</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.370" end="00:22:40.870" style="s2">confront that potential</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.020" end="00:22:44.200" style="s2">that&#39;s everywhere that faces us in every</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.870" end="00:22:47.110" style="s2">direction and to transform it into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.200" end="00:22:50.170" style="s2">most functional and habitable order</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.110" end="00:22:53.050" style="s2">possible and the way that that is to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.170" end="00:22:55.140" style="s2">done properly is with truth and and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.050" end="00:22:57.790" style="s2">think that all of those ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.140" end="00:22:59.890" style="s2">integral to the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.790" end="00:23:03.730" style="s2">substrate of Western culture there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.890" end="00:23:06.580" style="s2">fundamental ideas and so if you put the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.730" end="00:23:09.100" style="s2">group before the individual then all of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.580" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">that disappears I guess when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.100" end="00:23:12.870" style="s2">you&#39;re debating with the radical leftist</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:15.040" style="s2">postmodern types about free speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.870" end="00:23:16.600" style="s2">you&#39;re actually not debating with them</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.040" end="00:23:18.850" style="s2">about free speech because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.600" end="00:23:20.950" style="s2">believe in free speech it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.850" end="00:23:23.230" style="s2">their conceptual universe because for</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.950" end="00:23:27.000" style="s2">for speech to be free and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.230" end="00:23:29.290" style="s2">valuable the people conducting the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.000" end="00:23:31.630" style="s2">conversation have to be sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.290" end="00:23:34.150" style="s2">individuals capable of generating</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.630" end="00:23:37.210" style="s2">independent thought independent of their</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.150" end="00:23:38.770" style="s2">canonical group identity and reach a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.210" end="00:23:41.140" style="s2">consensus through that process of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.770" end="00:23:43.020" style="s2">dialogue none of that exists in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.140" end="00:23:44.950" style="s2">postmodern world all of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.020" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">preconceptions would be attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.950" end="00:23:48.910" style="s2">well something like Eurocentric neo</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:50.290" style="s2">colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.910" end="00:23:51.490" style="s2">something like that though seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.290" end="00:23:53.500" style="s2">that was the work of that is is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.490" end="00:23:54.940" style="s2">radical dismissal of the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.500" end="00:23:57.280" style="s2">that the individual has access to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.940" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">anything at all that is to say that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.280" end="00:24:02.679" style="s2">that in if you don&#39;t the belief in free</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:05.830" style="s2">speech is fundamentally motivated by the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.679" end="00:24:08.110" style="s2">by or or sustained by the confidence</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.830" end="00:24:09.940" style="s2">that our discourse our dialogue that</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.110" end="00:24:11.770" style="s2">human thinking itself can reach</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.940" end="00:24:15.340" style="s2">something stable that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.770" end="00:24:17.110" style="s2">relationship beyond by Beyond immediacy</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.340" end="00:24:17.890" style="s2">and that and that and that there are</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.110" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">beyond power</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.890" end="00:24:21.790" style="s2">and beyond power really it reaches</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:23.260" style="s2">beyond power to truth there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.790" end="00:24:26.650" style="s2">in ever having a conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.260" end="00:24:28.270" style="s2">anything if the conversation itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.650" end="00:24:30.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have access to something</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.270" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">transcendent exactly right well so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.190" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">happens with this is especially true for</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">people like Foucault and Derrida to to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.740" style="s2">some degree is well the first thing you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:40.390" style="s2">do is you define the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.740" end="00:24:42.040" style="s2">motivation as power because that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.390" end="00:24:44.860" style="s2">there is is there&#39;s the dominance of one</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.040" end="00:24:46.990" style="s2">group or the other and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.860" end="00:24:49.000" style="s2">dialogue has to serve power because</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.990" end="00:24:50.800" style="s2">that&#39;s all there is and so yeah all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.000" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">that is obliterated and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.800" end="00:24:57.550" style="s2">and by doing that actually the the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:24:59.800" style="s2">postmodernists make it impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.550" end="00:25:02.020" style="s2">them to solve the conundrum that validly</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.800" end="00:25:04.600" style="s2">drove pause post-modernism to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.020" end="00:25:06.730" style="s2">so the conundrum is infinite set of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.600" end="00:25:08.650" style="s2">potential interpretations that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.730" end="00:25:11.950" style="s2">conundrum that&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.650" end="00:25:13.810" style="s2">complexity right and and it&#39;s real so</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.950" end="00:25:15.730" style="s2">then the question is well is there any</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.810" end="00:25:17.710" style="s2">solution to the problem of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.730" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">and this is where issues of moral</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.710" end="00:25:23.290" style="s2">relativism start to become paramount</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:25.780" style="s2">because if there&#39;s no solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.290" end="00:25:27.970" style="s2">problem of complexity then there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.780" end="00:25:30.220" style="s2">canonical interpretations and all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.970" end="00:25:32.620" style="s2">interpretations are just well what would</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.220" end="00:25:36.190" style="s2">you call it there their expedient they</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.620" end="00:25:39.520" style="s2">have the expedience of power but see my</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.190" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">best pathway through that essentially I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.520" end="00:25:44.350" style="s2">think has come from the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">psychologist Jean Piaget and Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.350" end="00:25:49.960" style="s2">could be considered a neo-kantian you</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:52.810" style="s2">know the Kant&#39;s fundamental doctrine was</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.960" end="00:25:54.790" style="s2">act such that if your action became a</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.790" end="00:26:01.750" style="s2">universal benefit and so and but but</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.640" end="00:26:03.670" style="s2">Piaget differentiated that and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.750" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">and demonstrated how that evolves</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.670" end="00:26:08.020" style="s2">naturally in the course of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.020" end="00:26:13.750" style="s2">through play it&#39;s absolutely brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.330" end="00:26:16.390" style="s2">so I can give you a quick example so my</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.750" end="00:26:18.970" style="s2">granddaughter who&#39;s 14 months old has</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.390" end="00:26:20.680" style="s2">just learned a new game and the game is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.970" end="00:26:23.110" style="s2">she plays it with her wooden spoon and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.680" end="00:26:24.430" style="s2">the game is she has the spoon and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.110" end="00:26:26.560" style="s2">she looks at you and then she gives you</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.430" end="00:26:28.510" style="s2">the spoon and then you take it from her</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.560" end="00:26:30.460" style="s2">and she lets it go and then she watches</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.510" end="00:26:32.110" style="s2">you and then you give the spoon back and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.460" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">she&#39;s very happy to get the spoon back</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.110" end="00:26:35.920" style="s2">but she&#39;s also very happy to give it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.000" end="00:26:37.720" style="s2">you and then she turns to the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.920" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">person and she gives them the spoon and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.720" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">then she gets it back and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:45.970" style="s2">play with her and and the play is well</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:47.430" style="s2">now you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.970" end="00:26:50.740" style="s2">embody the principle of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.430" end="00:26:53.080" style="s2">right we can trade and and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.740" end="00:26:54.580" style="s2">repeating game it&#39;s not one trade you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.080" end="00:26:56.680" style="s2">don&#39;t end up with a spoon and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.580" end="00:26:58.960" style="s2">end up with the spoon we both have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.680" end="00:27:01.030" style="s2">spoon some of the time across time and</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.960" end="00:27:03.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some utility in the exchange</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.030" end="00:27:04.600" style="s2">itself okay so she&#39;s playing with that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.400" end="00:27:07.150" style="s2">and thrilled about</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.600" end="00:27:09.490" style="s2">wonder cuz it&#39;s a walloping walloping</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.150" end="00:27:11.560" style="s2">discovery and so then you take the spoon</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.490" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">from her and maybe you you hold it a</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.560" end="00:27:15.100" style="s2">little longer than she expects and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.570" style="s2">makes her a little nervous but then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.100" end="00:27:18.280" style="s2">give it back and then she&#39;s relieved and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.570" end="00:27:20.170" style="s2">that makes her happy or you cover the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.280" end="00:27:21.610" style="s2">spoon with your hand and then she&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.170" end="00:27:23.170" style="s2">bit confused about where it might be and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.610" end="00:27:25.570" style="s2">you show it to her and you give it back</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.170" end="00:27:26.950" style="s2">and she&#39;s happy about that or she</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.570" end="00:27:28.930" style="s2">reaches out to grab it and you pull it</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.950" end="00:27:30.370" style="s2">away a little bit and move it back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.930" end="00:27:32.410" style="s2">forth so she has to do a little more</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.370" end="00:27:34.210" style="s2">effort to get it and as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.410" end="00:27:37.750" style="s2">don&#39;t push that and it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.210" end="00:27:40.120" style="s2">challenge to her both both physically in</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.750" end="00:27:41.800" style="s2">terms of coordination but also</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.120" end="00:27:43.600" style="s2">psychologically in terms of delay of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.800" end="00:27:45.940" style="s2">gratification she also finds that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.600" end="00:27:48.490" style="s2">gratifying and and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.940" end="00:27:51.910" style="s2">is that you&#39;re you&#39;re showing how her</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.490" end="00:27:54.250" style="s2">how robust and resilient the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.910" end="00:27:56.200" style="s2">reciprocity is across sequences of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.250" end="00:27:57.610" style="s2">transformations and it&#39;s just this</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.200" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">little thing you do at the table you</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.610" end="00:28:02.530" style="s2">think well that&#39;s nothing it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:04.990" style="s2">it&#39;s something and so the PIA jetty an</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.530" end="00:28:06.550" style="s2">idea is something like there&#39;s an if</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.990" end="00:28:08.800" style="s2">there&#39;s an implicit morality that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.550" end="00:28:10.420" style="s2">emerges to constrain the infinite set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.800" end="00:28:12.000" style="s2">interpretations and it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.420" end="00:28:15.570" style="s2">the structure that will maintain</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.000" end="00:28:17.530" style="s2">reciprocity optimally in the largest</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.570" end="00:28:20.260" style="s2">including the largest number of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.530" end="00:28:22.600" style="s2">across the largest amount of time and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.260" end="00:28:23.710" style="s2">and so the way that I&#39;ve been portraying</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.600" end="00:28:25.390" style="s2">that for the people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.710" end="00:28:26.680" style="s2">listening to my lectures is that well</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.390" end="00:28:28.990" style="s2">you need to take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.680" end="00:28:31.120" style="s2">yourself as if you care for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.990" end="00:28:33.120" style="s2">okay so first we figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.120" end="00:28:35.860" style="s2">yourself well it&#39;s not just you now</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.120" end="00:28:38.440" style="s2">because you aren&#39;t just you now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.860" end="00:28:40.660" style="s2">the community of use that extra stretch</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.440" end="00:28:42.730" style="s2">across time so in order for you to take</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.660" end="00:28:44.590" style="s2">care of yourself properly now you have</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.730" end="00:28:47.020" style="s2">to learn to play an inter ativ game with</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">yourself that&#39;s sustainable and even</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.020" end="00:28:51.010" style="s2">potentially improvable across time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.390" style="s2">there aren&#39;t many games that you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:53.770" style="s2">play like that so that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.390" end="00:28:55.420" style="s2">radically constrain the set of</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.770" end="00:28:57.250" style="s2">possibilities and then it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.420" end="00:28:59.110" style="s2">constrained than that because not only</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.250" end="00:29:01.630" style="s2">do you have to play a game with yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.110" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">that can repeat across time to minimize</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.630" end="00:29:06.070" style="s2">suffering to remove the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.480" style="s2">death to allow for the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.070" end="00:29:09.250" style="s2">productive movement and a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.480" end="00:29:11.770" style="s2">of happiness but you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.250" end="00:29:14.560" style="s2">with other people around you and across</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.770" end="00:29:17.170" style="s2">time and so there&#39;s you and the multiple</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.560" end="00:29:18.610" style="s2">use embedded in your family and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.170" end="00:29:21.340" style="s2">multiplicity of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.610" end="00:29:24.070" style="s2">members embedded inside a culture and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.340" end="00:29:26.500" style="s2">and the extension of that culture across</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.070" end="00:29:27.970" style="s2">time and so for you to act properly then</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.500" end="00:29:29.860" style="s2">all of those things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.970" end="00:29:32.679" style="s2">harmoniously balanced at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.860" end="00:29:34.990" style="s2">and that radically reduces the set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.679" end="00:29:39.400" style="s2">potential interpretations and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.990" end="00:29:43.350" style="s2">antidote to the to the chaos of of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.400" end="00:29:47.620" style="s2">infinite array of potential perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.350" end="00:29:49.000" style="s2">worlds and and well and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.620" end="00:29:50.740" style="s2">questions that emerge out of that like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.000" end="00:29:52.440" style="s2">well what&#39;s the best way to play that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.740" end="00:29:55.330" style="s2">game but we certainly know that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.440" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">reciprocity fair play the spirit of fair</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.330" end="00:30:00.160" style="s2">plays is is immensely important to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:02.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what Piaget documented and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.160" end="00:30:04.150" style="s2">what it&#39;s what we all know and also that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.710" end="00:30:06.100" style="s2">there&#39;s something about truth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.150" end="00:30:09.070" style="s2">absolutely integral to that as well so</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.100" end="00:30:13.690" style="s2">and the post modernists just they just</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.070" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">they got the problem right but they they</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.690" end="00:30:19.809" style="s2">never went the next steps and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:21.700" style="s2">partly because well why is it why is it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.809" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">they had an easy answer at hand that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.700" end="00:30:25.299" style="s2">required almost no transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:27.309" style="s2">their original worldview well we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.299" end="00:30:29.410" style="s2">keep the Marxism we&#39;ll just transform it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.309" end="00:30:32.230" style="s2">into something that looks different and</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.410" end="00:30:35.260" style="s2">that&#39;ll be good enough minimal change so</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.230" end="00:30:36.820" style="s2">it seems to me that the the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.260" end="00:30:38.679" style="s2">collective the collectivist thinking</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.820" end="00:30:41.549" style="s2">that&#39;s at work in the insistence that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.679" end="00:30:44.650" style="s2">only the group matters has the effect of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.549" end="00:30:46.570" style="s2">radically annihilating the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.650" end="00:30:48.190" style="s2">the individual in fact that maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.570" end="00:30:50.020" style="s2">its its asset well I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.190" end="00:30:51.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a actually that isn&#39;t saying I</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.020" end="00:30:53.590" style="s2">believe so at the border like and</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.880" end="00:30:55.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a murderous</p>

<p begin="00:30:55.240" end="00:31:00.220" style="s2">that needs to be accounted for and so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.970" end="00:31:03.400" style="s2">see what&#39;s at the bottom and this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.220" end="00:31:05.110" style="s2">partly consequence say of the insistence</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.400" end="00:31:08.110" style="s2">that the West is a patriarchal tyranny</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.049" end="00:31:19.030" style="s2">but because Abel deserved to be God&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:19.030" end="00:31:25.660" style="s2">right and it&#39;s very bitter it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:32.020" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly bitter if you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.370" end="00:31:32.230" style="s2">gap is widening because the person who</p>

<p begin="00:33:48.830" end="00:33:52.460" style="s2">motivations that pile up as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.600" end="00:33:54.410" style="s2">bitterness the hatred that bitterness</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.800" end="00:34:01.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve and you squandered it and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.290" end="00:34:04.790" style="s2">and the feeling of that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.970" end="00:34:07.130" style="s2">why Cain tells God after he gets caught</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.790" end="00:34:08.860" style="s2">after his murderous act he says that his</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.130" end="00:34:11.060" style="s2">punishment is more than he can bear</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.860" end="00:34:12.919" style="s2">because it&#39;s the realization of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.060" end="00:34:14.360" style="s2">he&#39;s done he&#39;s destroyed his own ideal</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.919" end="00:34:17.210" style="s2">and that&#39;s what you do if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.360" end="00:34:19.340" style="s2">collectivist you destroy yourself as an</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.340" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s nothing in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.950" end="00:34:27.919" style="s2">except I would say a continually opening</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:29.750" style="s2">pit of hopelessness and despair and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:31.820" style="s2">that drives bitterness and hatred and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.750" end="00:34:33.800" style="s2">desire for revenge and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.820" end="00:34:36.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a terrible cycle and we&#39;ve seen it</p>

<p begin="00:34:36.200" end="00:34:40.880" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t yet precisely learned</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.780" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">from that so to me it&#39;s part of an</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.380" end="00:36:30.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t a room the room that you see is</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:34.440" style="s2">your preconception of the space that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.930" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">inhabit what&#39;s there is is a fragment of</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.440" end="00:36:41.279" style="s2">infinity that&#39;s what&#39;s there and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:43.529" style="s2">you see is the is the is the low</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.279" end="00:36:46.440" style="s2">resolution consequence of your</p>

<p begin="00:36:46.440" end="00:36:50.430" style="s2">that&#39;s your initial room and you think</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:52.109" style="s2">well no that&#39;s not the room see part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.430" end="00:36:54.329" style="s2">what artists do for example when Van</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.109" end="00:36:54.869" style="s2">Gogh paints a room and you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.329" end="00:36:57.000" style="s2">glowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.869" end="00:36:59.849" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to show you what&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.000" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">your perception of the room and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.849" end="00:37:04.619" style="s2">this technically like the way that your</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:07.849" style="s2">visual system is set up is that whenever</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.619" end="00:37:10.650" style="s2">memory and presumption can can can</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.849" end="00:37:13.529" style="s2">replace direct perception it will</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.650" end="00:37:16.230" style="s2">because it&#39;s simpler so you literally</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.529" end="00:37:19.230" style="s2">see what you expect to see and if what</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.230" end="00:37:23.670" style="s2">you see is dull and drab and boring and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.230" end="00:37:26.430" style="s2">pointless and and and uninspiring then</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.670" end="00:37:28.490" style="s2">that&#39;s you it&#39;s not what&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.430" end="00:37:31.410" style="s2">what the artist does when he or she</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.490" end="00:37:33.750" style="s2">represents that mundane reality is to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.410" end="00:37:35.819" style="s2">remind you of what&#39;s behind it the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.750" end="00:37:37.859" style="s2">potential that&#39;s there and so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.819" end="00:37:39.450" style="s2">suggesting to people is that they take</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.859" end="00:37:42.500" style="s2">the potential that&#39;s right in front of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.450" end="00:37:46.019" style="s2">them it&#39;s like okay and here&#39;s the rule</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.500" end="00:37:49.349" style="s2">you&#39;re aiming up there&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.019" end="00:37:51.509" style="s2">you could change that you would change</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.349" end="00:37:53.940" style="s2">that might be a very small thing could</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.509" end="00:37:56.339" style="s2">well that&#39;s within the grasp of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.940" end="00:37:58.230" style="s2">power would is within the grasp of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.339" end="00:38:00.359" style="s2">will to combine those two things might</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.230" end="00:38:02.700" style="s2">be very small shift you might only be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.359" end="00:38:05.789" style="s2">willing to make a very tiny step forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.700" end="00:38:08.609" style="s2">it&#39;s like fine good enough make a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.789" end="00:38:10.650" style="s2">step forward and that makes you a slight</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.609" end="00:38:12.510" style="s2">bit stronger than you were before and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.650" end="00:38:14.910" style="s2">then the next step can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.510" end="00:38:18.000" style="s2">slightly larger and it&#39;s it&#39;s the path</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.910" end="00:38:21.030" style="s2">of humility it&#39;s what people it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.000" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">people act out when so there&#39;s this</p>

<p begin="00:39:03.330" end="00:39:07.830" style="s2">that place that we talked about already</p>

<p begin="00:39:20.670" end="00:39:25.380" style="s2">right assuming that we have some</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.380" end="00:39:29.550" style="s2">is certainly at least true at the human</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.640" end="00:39:40.860" style="s2">humbly so that&#39;s one step at a time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.220" end="00:39:42.540" style="s2">you do it despite your burden and your</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.170" end="00:40:01.800" style="s2">one thing that strikes people deepest in</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.790" end="00:40:03.810" style="s2">our human experience is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.800" end="00:40:05.760" style="s2">infinitely particular I mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.810" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">mentioned your your granddaughter I mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.760" end="00:40:10.470" style="s2">that the the the loves the people the</p>

<p begin="00:40:12.300" end="00:40:16.230" style="s2">this this top-down sense as if there</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.210" end="00:40:18.360" style="s2">could be that well you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.230" end="00:40:20.700" style="s2">kinds of clothes and the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.360" end="00:40:23.450" style="s2">experience for all human beings it that</p>

<p begin="00:40:26.730" end="00:40:31.050" style="s2">which it seems to me is infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.339" style="s2">particular but not infinitely particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.050" end="00:40:33.900" style="s2">in the sense of which those particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.339" end="00:40:36.420" style="s2">needs to squall off into nothingness</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.900" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">those particular czar precisely our</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.420" end="00:40:41.730" style="s2">points of access to the transcendent to</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.730" end="00:40:46.140" style="s2">that that&#39;s where the reality is yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.070" end="00:40:47.910" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s why you said that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.140" end="00:40:49.740" style="s2">modern man can&#39;t see God because they</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.910" end="00:40:51.180" style="s2">don&#39;t look low enough yes they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.740" end="00:40:52.589" style="s2">they&#39;re not paying attention to the</p>

<p begin="00:40:52.589" end="00:40:56.700" style="s2">because if the particularity is where</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.750" end="00:40:58.829" style="s2">the pen meets the paper right yes and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.700" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">it&#39;s just a tiny dot every every like</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.829" end="00:41:02.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re when you&#39;re writing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:04.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a dot and then it extends into a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.280" end="00:41:06.060" style="s2">line and those transform into words and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.260" end="00:41:07.740" style="s2">sentences and paragraphs but the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.060" end="00:41:10.500" style="s2">particular act is where the pen means</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.740" end="00:41:12.390" style="s2">yes yes yes that focal point right</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.500" end="00:41:14.460" style="s2">that&#39;s the center of the cross by the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.390" end="00:41:16.200" style="s2">way yes same yes yes we mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.460" end="00:41:20.190" style="s2">cross I mean certainly in the in in in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.200" end="00:41:21.540" style="s2">in in the in the history of of the West</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.190" end="00:41:23.880" style="s2">one of the ways this comes through is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.540" end="00:41:25.470" style="s2">and in the East to is in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.880" end="00:41:27.420" style="s2">theology is the very notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.470" end="00:41:30.570" style="s2">Incarnation you know what is that to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:32.910" style="s2">but that the the infinite is in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.570" end="00:41:35.369" style="s2">particular and that they that that they</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.910" end="00:41:39.329" style="s2">are that they are Co inherent that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.369" end="00:41:41.790" style="s2">infinite in fact has no life except in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.329" end="00:41:45.329" style="s2">the particular and the particular itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.790" end="00:41:47.550" style="s2">has a relation to or is comprehended by</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.329" end="00:41:50.430" style="s2">that very infinite and so it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.550" end="00:41:54.780" style="s2">that that what is going on there is an</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.430" end="00:41:59.329" style="s2">affirmation that every particularity no</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.780" end="00:42:03.359" style="s2">matter how tiny itself is revelatory of</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.329" end="00:42:04.980" style="s2">a transcendent and yes I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.359" end="00:42:06.780" style="s2">from the Gospel of Thomas but I might</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.980" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">have this wrong the kingdom of God is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.780" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">spread upon the earth but men do not see</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:13.109" style="s2">it and that&#39;s that that&#39;s that infinite</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:15.180" style="s2">that&#39;s that infinite possibility in each</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.109" end="00:42:17.220" style="s2">moment of particularity and that is what</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.180" end="00:42:21.750" style="s2">artists that is what great artists are</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.220" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">reminding us of they&#39;ll take a slice of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.750" end="00:42:27.150" style="s2">space and time it was it money who</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:29.310" style="s2">painted the haystacks he went out into</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.150" end="00:42:31.829" style="s2">the fields in France and he painted the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.310" end="00:42:34.140" style="s2">same haystack like many many times under</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.829" end="00:42:36.060" style="s2">different conditions of lighting just to</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.140" end="00:42:38.460" style="s2">show how different it yes if it&#39;s if</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.060" end="00:42:39.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a haystack it&#39;s the same thing but</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.460" end="00:42:41.299" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t he</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.559" end="00:42:43.729" style="s2">attention to the particularity x&#39; and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.299" end="00:42:45.680" style="s2">what great artists are trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.729" end="00:42:48.739" style="s2">well first of all so imagine a painting</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.680" end="00:42:51.559" style="s2">so it&#39;s a painting of a landscape and so</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.739" end="00:42:53.689" style="s2">the first thing is that it&#39;s it&#39;s layers</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.559" end="00:42:55.579" style="s2">of time because the painter has gone out</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.689" end="00:42:57.170" style="s2">there and seeing the landscape and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.579" end="00:42:58.400" style="s2">seen it again and then seen it again and</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.170" end="00:43:00.259" style="s2">then seen it again and then seen it</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.400" end="00:43:01.819" style="s2">again and it has to pay attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.259" end="00:43:03.859" style="s2">particularity x&#39; of the light and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.819" end="00:43:06.529" style="s2">color and all of that to represent it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.859" end="00:43:09.349" style="s2">properly so it&#39;s and and and the mere</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.529" end="00:43:13.279" style="s2">fact that he&#39;s done that is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.349" end="00:43:16.249" style="s2">the acting out of the idea that in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.279" end="00:43:19.039" style="s2">tiny slice of time and space there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.249" end="00:43:21.199" style="s2">something worth attending to for an</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.039" end="00:43:24.259" style="s2">infinite amount of time but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.199" end="00:43:25.789" style="s2">because you just can&#39;t do it but you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.259" end="00:43:27.259" style="s2">need to know that you could do it and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.789" end="00:43:30.019" style="s2">then it would be worthwhile and so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.259" end="00:43:33.289" style="s2">painter encapsulate s&#39; the landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.019" end="00:43:36.619" style="s2">then frames it and says like look look</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.289" end="00:43:39.219" style="s2">through this window at the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.619" end="00:43:41.209" style="s2">that&#39;s behind the low-resolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.219" end="00:43:43.789" style="s2">representation of your assumption the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.209" end="00:43:45.979" style="s2">blindness that you the expedient</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.789" end="00:43:48.469" style="s2">blindness that you by necessity bring to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.979" end="00:43:50.569" style="s2">bear to every situation remember what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.469" end="00:43:52.429" style="s2">behind this always remember what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.569" end="00:43:52.849" style="s2">behind this and that&#39;s what art calls us</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.429" end="00:43:55.249" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.849" end="00:43:57.589" style="s2">that&#39;s what beauty calls us to do is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.249" end="00:44:00.049" style="s2">make contact with that then you say well</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.589" end="00:44:02.900" style="s2">the problem with the particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.049" end="00:44:05.029" style="s2">problem with it particularly is that it</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.900" end="00:44:06.829" style="s2">brings suffering and the bringing of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.029" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">suffering with particularly can also</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.829" end="00:44:11.209" style="s2">allow evil to enter the world because</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:13.279" style="s2">that particular suffering can engender</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.209" end="00:44:14.509" style="s2">bitterness and resentment and hatred and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.279" end="00:44:16.819" style="s2">all of those things and the desire to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.509" end="00:44:18.559" style="s2">destroy so that particularly carries</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.819" end="00:44:20.929" style="s2">with it a tremendous risk and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.559" end="00:44:22.939" style="s2">tremendous burden and so the answer the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.929" end="00:44:25.130" style="s2">question is well how do you tolerate the</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.939" end="00:44:27.499" style="s2">particularity and take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.130" end="00:44:29.390" style="s2">potential and the answer is to make a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.499" end="00:44:31.339" style="s2">relationship with the infinite that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.390" end="00:44:34.160" style="s2">behind the particularly and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.339" end="00:44:37.789" style="s2">fundamental religious idea is to if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.160" end="00:44:41.150" style="s2">can maintain that particularly but also</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.789" end="00:44:44.209" style="s2">stay in contact with what&#39;s transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.150" end="00:44:46.279" style="s2">and infinite beyond that then you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.209" end="00:44:48.619" style="s2">then you have the potential strength to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.279" end="00:44:50.329" style="s2">tolerate the catastrophe of yes what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.619" end="00:44:51.289" style="s2">limited yes and then you get to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.329" end="00:44:52.830" style="s2">your cake and eat it too</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.289" end="00:44:55.110" style="s2">in principle yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.830" end="00:44:57.630" style="s2">yes I want to return to education in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.110" end="00:45:01.890" style="s2">moment but but on the way there as it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.630" end="00:45:03.840" style="s2">were Jordan I want to ask you you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.890" end="00:45:07.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about this the inflection</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.840" end="00:45:10.250" style="s2">point what is the inflection point and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.230" end="00:45:12.630" style="s2">how might it be understood relative to</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.250" end="00:45:17.160" style="s2">what I would I take to be a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.630" end="00:45:20.270" style="s2">decadent worldview in its last gasps it</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.160" end="00:45:24.270" style="s2">seems to me even that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.270" end="00:45:27.020" style="s2">frankly simply slanderous attacks on you</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.270" end="00:45:32.330" style="s2">personal personally blatant</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.020" end="00:45:35.250" style="s2">misrepresentations of the the very plain</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.330" end="00:45:37.710" style="s2">fact of what you&#39;re saying it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.250" end="00:45:40.380" style="s2">me that there&#39;s an animus there that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.710" end="00:45:41.640" style="s2">precisely there&#39;s an animus there but</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.380" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">the question is where is that coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.640" end="00:45:44.850" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:47.430" style="s2">well we&#39;ve if you look at Derrida for</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.850" end="00:45:50.370" style="s2">example and his critique of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.430" end="00:45:52.830" style="s2">logo centrism you know as as the central</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.370" end="00:45:56.190" style="s2">motif of the West let&#39;s say and and he</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.830" end="00:45:58.860" style="s2">and he knew at multiple levels what that</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.190" end="00:46:01.230" style="s2">critique meant because he knew what</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.860" end="00:46:02.430" style="s2">logos meant logos means embodied truth</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.230" end="00:46:04.110" style="s2">and there is of course a religious</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.430" end="00:46:06.420" style="s2">dimension to that and so he was</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.110" end="00:46:08.760" style="s2">criticizing the notion of FAL logo</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.420" end="00:46:11.250" style="s2">centrism and and so he was going right</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.760" end="00:46:13.410" style="s2">at the core of the doctrine of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.250" end="00:46:16.500" style="s2">individual now the question is why might</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.410" end="00:46:19.350" style="s2">someone do that now I think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.500" end="00:46:20.910" style="s2">for that fundamentally is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.350" end="00:46:23.190" style="s2">terrible responsibility that goes along</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.910" end="00:46:28.530" style="s2">with it so imagine that you offered</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.190" end="00:46:31.710" style="s2">people here&#39;s the offer offer one you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.530" end="00:46:34.380" style="s2">you don&#39;t matter you it&#39;s it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.710" end="00:46:37.050" style="s2">say the narrowest of materialist</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.380" end="00:46:39.360" style="s2">viewpoints is you weren&#39;t here than you</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.050" end="00:46:41.310" style="s2">were for a brief period of time and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.360" end="00:46:43.770" style="s2">you&#39;re gone and that all washes out in</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.310" end="00:46:45.630" style="s2">the endless sands of time nothing in</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.770" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">your life is significant nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.630" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">humanity is significant nothing about</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.230" style="s2">the world itself is significant it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">a matter of blind random chance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.230" end="00:46:56.940" style="s2">all the same in the end</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:59.340" style="s2">who cares in a million years right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.940" end="00:47:02.280" style="s2">and the price you pay for that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.340" end="00:47:04.980" style="s2">insignificance but the advantage that</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.280" end="00:47:05.740" style="s2">you gain from that is that fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:07.540" style="s2">you have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.740" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">possibility because nothing you do</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.540" end="00:47:11.410" style="s2">matters and so then there&#39;s no moral</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:14.440" style="s2">burden there&#39;s no obligation and of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.410" end="00:47:16.300" style="s2">course if you can gather expedient</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.440" end="00:47:18.280" style="s2">pleasure well your deteriorating</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.300" end="00:47:21.280" style="s2">pointlessly then that&#39;s all to the good</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.280" end="00:47:23.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s a libertine ism as well and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.280" end="00:47:25.060" style="s2">that&#39;s inviting obviously because</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.560" end="00:47:27.690" style="s2">short-term pleasure is by definition</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.060" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">inviting and so you can abandon any</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.690" end="00:47:32.740" style="s2">pretension to a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.900" style="s2">infinite and consider that only a sign</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.740" end="00:47:37.240" style="s2">of delusion and weakness assume that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.900" end="00:47:39.610" style="s2">your life is material and irrelevant it</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.240" end="00:47:42.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter and then you can shrug</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.610" end="00:47:43.780" style="s2">off all responsibilities and pursue</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.010" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">short-term pleasure well there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.780" end="00:47:49.150" style="s2">real advantages in that it&#39;s very it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:50.830" style="s2">very easy pathway the alternative is as</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.150" end="00:47:55.090" style="s2">far as I&#39;m concerned is note you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.630" end="00:51:02.500" style="s2">would you how would you describe what</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.369" end="00:51:04.900" style="s2">that wave is that that you didn&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.500" end="00:51:07.450" style="s2">but that you will see some of its</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.900" end="00:51:10.180" style="s2">technological so so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.450" end="00:51:12.730" style="s2">wave is it&#39;s got multiple levels so so</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.180" end="00:51:14.650" style="s2">we could start from we&#39;ll start from I</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.730" end="00:51:16.210" style="s2">would say what&#39;s most obvious and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.650" end="00:51:19.810" style="s2">would be the medium rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.210" end="00:51:21.730" style="s2">message so I and these people that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.810" end="00:51:23.800" style="s2">been associated with this intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.730" end="00:51:25.270" style="s2">dark web group where we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.800" end="00:51:26.740" style="s2">fortunate position of being early</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.270" end="00:51:29.589" style="s2">adopters of extraordinarily powerful</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.740" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">technologies so and the technologies are</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.589" end="00:51:33.000" style="s2">twofold there&#39;s there&#39;s online video and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:35.190" style="s2">then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.000" end="00:51:37.020" style="s2">podcasts and and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.190" end="00:51:40.020" style="s2">technologically revolutionary in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.020" end="00:51:41.780" style="s2">variety of ways so online video is</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.020" end="00:51:44.520" style="s2">revolutionary because it brings</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.780" end="00:51:47.130" style="s2">something closely akin to a live</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.520" end="00:51:51.030" style="s2">performance to an infinitely large</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.130" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">number of people on demand permanently</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.030" end="00:51:54.270" style="s2">so then you think well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:57.090" style="s2">advantage of a book</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.270" end="00:51:59.430" style="s2">well it&#39;s permanent it&#39;s relatively</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.090" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">low-cost it&#39;s easily distributable right</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.430" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">so well what&#39;s the advantage to online</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:07.230" style="s2">video well it&#39;s it&#39;s inexpensive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:08.849" style="s2">not inexpensive it&#39;s free it&#39;s far</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.230" end="00:52:11.400" style="s2">easier to produce than a book like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.849" end="00:52:13.710" style="s2">lag time from video to publication is</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.400" end="00:52:16.290" style="s2">the day like we could put this online</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.710" end="00:52:19.290" style="s2">today instead of the three year lag that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.290" end="00:52:21.690" style="s2">a book would require and then far more</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.290" end="00:52:23.700" style="s2">people can watch and listen then can</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.690" end="00:52:27.599" style="s2">read because reading is a minority</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.700" end="00:52:29.730" style="s2">ability in some sense really real expert</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.599" end="00:52:31.590" style="s2">level reading you know that because such</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.730" end="00:52:33.390" style="s2">a tiny minority of people buy books and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.590" end="00:52:35.220" style="s2">people are made uncomfortable by books</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.390" end="00:52:37.230" style="s2">they&#39;re intimidated by them even if they</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.220" end="00:52:38.940" style="s2">have the intelligence in principle to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.230" end="00:52:40.619" style="s2">the reading it&#39;s not part of their</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.940" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">cultural milieu that&#39;s a small minority</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.619" end="00:52:47.400" style="s2">of people and so all of a sudden online</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:49.589" style="s2">video allows allows the spoken word to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.400" end="00:52:51.480" style="s2">have the same impact as the written word</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.589" end="00:52:54.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s deadly that&#39;s a good and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.480" end="00:52:57.180" style="s2">Burgh revolution and then with podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.180" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">that&#39;s even magnified because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.180" end="00:53:01.740" style="s2">have to sit and watch a podcast you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:03.960" style="s2">walk around you can exercise you can do</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.740" end="00:53:06.210" style="s2">the dishes you can you can drive many</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.960" end="00:53:08.490" style="s2">people who come to my lectures are like</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.210" end="00:53:10.800" style="s2">long-haul truckers and guys who run</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.490" end="00:53:13.560" style="s2">forklifts and you know they&#39;re in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.800" end="00:53:16.650" style="s2">machinery all day and all they do is</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.560" end="00:53:18.359" style="s2">listen to podcasts and so all of us and</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.650" end="00:53:20.430" style="s2">they can listen to the podcasts because</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.359" end="00:53:22.650" style="s2">more people can listen then can read and</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.430" end="00:53:24.330" style="s2">may be way more people can listen than</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.650" end="00:53:26.609" style="s2">can read we have no idea maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.330" end="00:53:29.220" style="s2">potential market is ten times as big and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.609" end="00:53:31.589" style="s2">so they can do it when they want to they</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.220" end="00:53:33.270" style="s2">can also do it in private if you read</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.589" end="00:53:34.500" style="s2">and you&#39;re on the subway people can tell</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.270" end="00:53:36.119" style="s2">you&#39;re reading if you&#39;re sitting at home</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.500" end="00:53:37.710" style="s2">and reading well then you&#39;re with a book</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.119" end="00:53:39.030" style="s2">and if you&#39;re uncomfortable with a book</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.710" end="00:53:41.099" style="s2">you think that&#39;s pretentious or</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.030" end="00:53:42.930" style="s2">presumptuous or part of a class that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.099" end="00:53:44.790" style="s2">don&#39;t belong to or anything that makes</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.930" end="00:53:46.650" style="s2">you feel inferior well you can just</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.790" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">circumvent that you listen</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.650" end="00:53:52.050" style="s2">private and so people and people are</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:54.030" style="s2">taking that opportunity like mad and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.050" end="00:53:55.470" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the wave let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.030" end="00:53:58.110" style="s2">technological revolution in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.470" end="00:54:00.450" style="s2">communication that&#39;s illustrated that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.110" end="00:54:01.890" style="s2">people have far more depth and capacity</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.450" end="00:54:03.960" style="s2">to concentrate that anyone would have</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.890" end="00:54:07.290" style="s2">imagined you even see this with Netflix</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.960" end="00:54:09.510" style="s2">and HBO it used to be on TV there was an</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.290" end="00:54:10.740" style="s2">idea that well movie was about as long</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.510" end="00:54:13.320" style="s2">as you could attract people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.740" end="00:54:15.150" style="s2">for 90 minutes that&#39;s the most the</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.320" end="00:54:16.770" style="s2">typical person could concentrate for</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.150" end="00:54:18.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like that turned out to be complete</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.770" end="00:54:21.420" style="s2">rubbish people will follow these</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.450" end="00:54:23.790" style="s2">incredibly complex like literary level</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.420" end="00:54:25.980" style="s2">net narratives Breaking Bad for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.790" end="00:54:28.230" style="s2">that has multiple characters following</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.980" end="00:54:30.810" style="s2">multiple streams of development for four</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.230" end="00:54:33.090" style="s2">endless hours and they&#39;ll binge watch it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.810" end="00:54:34.920" style="s2">so we have way more capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.090" end="00:54:37.760" style="s2">sustained concentration that we thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.920" end="00:54:40.050" style="s2">and these new bandwidth unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.760" end="00:54:42.270" style="s2">technologies are revealing that to us</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.050" end="00:54:45.240" style="s2">and I happen to be an early adopter of</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.270" end="00:54:48.060" style="s2">this and so that&#39;s that&#39;s part one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.240" end="00:54:49.950" style="s2">the wave and then then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.060" end="00:54:52.290" style="s2">message part and it has something to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.950" end="00:54:55.650" style="s2">with see our culture for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.290" end="00:54:57.570" style="s2">time has articulated out a right of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.650" end="00:54:59.640" style="s2">rights you have rights you need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.570" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">demand them you need to claim them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.640" end="00:55:04.680" style="s2">like but but that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s half</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:06.930" style="s2">the story and it&#39;s not the most salutary</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.680" end="00:55:09.090" style="s2">half because it turns out that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.930" end="00:55:10.890" style="s2">meaning in your life isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.090" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">consequence of the claiming of rights</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.890" end="00:55:15.240" style="s2">that rights are in some sense what other</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:17.160" style="s2">people owe you I know there&#39;s more to it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.240" end="00:55:18.840" style="s2">than that but but it&#39;s that in large</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.160" end="00:55:21.510" style="s2">part well you can just get what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.840" end="00:55:23.070" style="s2">owed it&#39;s like no that&#39;s not where</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.510" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find your meaning what</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.070" end="00:55:26.370" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna find where you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:27.870" style="s2">find your meaning is responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.370" end="00:55:30.270" style="s2">which is the other half of the rights</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.870" end="00:55:33.000" style="s2">responsibility equation and people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.270" end="00:55:36.030" style="s2">know that this is that the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.000" end="00:55:38.010" style="s2">the that what would you call this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.030" end="00:55:40.140" style="s2">where this is where this is the point</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.010" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">where things come together properly you</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.140" end="00:55:43.830" style="s2">need a meaning in your life to forestall</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:45.840" style="s2">the suffering and to make you strong</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.830" end="00:55:46.860" style="s2">enough to resist malevolence where is</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.840" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">the meaning to be found</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.860" end="00:55:53.550" style="s2">rights impulsive pleasure and happiness</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:56.130" style="s2">no responsibilities oh who would have</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.550" end="00:55:58.500" style="s2">guessed that it&#39;s not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.130" end="00:56:00.270" style="s2">narrative because the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.500" end="00:56:01.860" style="s2">narrative even is usually about duty</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.270" end="00:56:04.290" style="s2">patriotism or something like that which</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.860" end="00:56:06.200" style="s2">which is okay but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.200" end="00:56:12.030" style="s2">this is different it&#39;s like no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.090" end="00:56:17.250" style="s2">understand is that what makes life worth</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.030" end="00:56:20.490" style="s2">living is to pick up the tube to to take</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.250" end="00:56:23.310" style="s2">its catastrophe and embrace it and carry</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.490" end="00:56:25.950" style="s2">it and to realize through that process</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.310" end="00:56:27.570" style="s2">who you are so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.950" end="00:56:30.050" style="s2">figured out in this lecture tour there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.570" end="00:56:32.040" style="s2">this old idea that you go into the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.050" end="00:56:34.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a Nietzsche an idea that you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.040" end="00:56:36.660" style="s2">gaze into the abyss you gaze long and</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.350" end="00:56:38.370" style="s2">what you find in the abyss is a monster</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.660" end="00:56:40.320" style="s2">Tolstoy wrote about that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.370" end="00:56:42.150" style="s2">dragon at the bottom of the abyss let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.320" end="00:56:45.390" style="s2">say that&#39;s Satan himself for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.150" end="00:56:46.950" style="s2">and but if you go into that into that as</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.660" end="00:57:07.830" style="s2">fie that well what does that mean it</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.580" end="00:57:09.330" style="s2">means something what means that if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.830" end="00:57:11.250" style="s2">look in the darkness you find the light</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.330" end="00:57:12.780" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing it means and that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.250" end="00:57:14.550" style="s2">light really stands out against the</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.780" end="00:57:16.200" style="s2">darkness but that the light is to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.550" end="00:57:17.790" style="s2">found in the darkness so that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.200" end="00:57:20.250" style="s2">interesting thing that&#39;s a quest</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.790" end="00:57:21.900" style="s2">narrative but it means more than that it</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.250" end="00:57:25.500" style="s2">means something fundamental so we know</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.900" end="00:57:28.220" style="s2">for example that if you take yourself</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.500" end="00:57:31.080" style="s2">out of your current state of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.220" end="00:57:33.090" style="s2">predictability and safety and you put</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.080" end="00:57:35.460" style="s2">yourself in a new situation you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.090" end="00:57:37.290" style="s2">right you&#39;ll absorb you incorporate new</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.460" end="00:57:39.540" style="s2">information so that&#39;s a cognitive issue</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.290" end="00:57:42.390" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t all that happens what</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.540" end="00:57:44.460" style="s2">happens is that new genes turn on within</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.390" end="00:57:47.430" style="s2">you and code for the production of new</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.460" end="00:57:50.940" style="s2">proteins that happens neurologically new</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.430" end="00:57:52.830" style="s2">parts of you turn on and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.940" end="00:57:54.720" style="s2">that if you can move yourself out into</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.830" end="00:57:57.510" style="s2">the world and push yourself out against</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:58:00.420" style="s2">a maxim array of challenges more and</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.510" end="00:58:01.860" style="s2">more of you turn on turns on and - and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.420" end="00:58:05.070" style="s2">then the question would be well what</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.860" end="00:58:06.780" style="s2">would you be if all of you that could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.070" end="00:58:08.820" style="s2">turned on was turned on and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.780" end="00:58:11.310" style="s2">would be you would be the resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.820" end="00:58:14.260" style="s2">of the ancestral father that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.310" end="00:58:15.520" style="s2">would be and so that&#39;s why Christ says</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.260" end="00:58:17.770" style="s2">I am the way and the truth and the life</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.520" end="00:58:19.900" style="s2">and no one comes to the Father except</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.770" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">through me what that means is that if</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.900" end="00:58:26.290" style="s2">you take on the unbearable burden of</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:28.840" style="s2">being voluntarily then that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.290" end="00:58:29.770" style="s2">you into the ancestral father and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.840" end="00:58:32.230" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.770" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2">and so that&#39;s unbelievably optimistic</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.230" end="00:58:36.370" style="s2">because what it it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.000" end="00:58:37.900" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s dark beyond belief</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.370" end="00:58:39.640" style="s2">rights to say well the world is</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.900" end="00:58:41.440" style="s2">characterized by suffering and by</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.640" end="00:58:43.720" style="s2">malevolence of a depth that&#39;s virtually</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.440" end="00:58:46.030" style="s2">beyond comprehension but if you choose</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.720" end="00:58:49.000" style="s2">to comprehend that what you discover in</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.030" end="00:58:51.700" style="s2">that is the light that destroys the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.000" end="00:58:53.620" style="s2">darkness and that&#39;s well that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.700" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">that&#39;s really something to discover it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.620" end="00:58:59.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s it&#39;s the discovery that</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:01.570" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a discovery that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.860" end="00:59:03.130" style="s2">profound than that that&#39;s the search for</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.570" end="00:59:05.410" style="s2">the Holy Grail or the Philosopher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.130" end="00:59:07.240" style="s2">Stone all of that and isn&#39;t that that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:08.980" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the search and indeed the</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.240" end="00:59:12.100" style="s2">finding that every human being is is</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.980" end="00:59:15.130" style="s2">made for what I want to ask you Arden is</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.100" end="00:59:18.040" style="s2">about the role of Education here it</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.130" end="00:59:19.630" style="s2">seems to me that that what the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.040" end="00:59:21.820" style="s2">that people are finding in your work</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.630" end="00:59:23.560" style="s2">that you can listen to in a podcast you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.820" end="00:59:27.820" style="s2">can you can&#39;t you can while you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.560" end="00:59:31.450" style="s2">a long run drive across the prairies or</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.820" end="00:59:34.300" style="s2">whatever it may be but it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.450" end="00:59:38.500" style="s2">that that the the deconstruction of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.300" end="00:59:40.210" style="s2">culture by a worldview that has denied</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.500" end="00:59:43.210" style="s2">the integrity of the individual that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.210" end="00:59:45.720" style="s2">denied the individuals relation to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.210" end="00:59:48.880" style="s2">transcendent to any stable knowing</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.720" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">denied the dignity of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.880" end="00:59:54.010" style="s2">that that deconstruction is not for no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.040" end="00:59:55.930" style="s2">reason that the the postmodern view</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.010" end="00:59:58.330" style="s2">calls itself deconstruction that has</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.930" end="01:00:00.190" style="s2">very deconstructive effects in my view</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.330" end="01:00:03.880" style="s2">in the world it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.190" end="01:00:06.300" style="s2">rebirth or the the Renaissance of a more</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.880" end="01:00:09.520" style="s2">adequate a more fully human culture</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.300" end="01:00:11.290" style="s2">depends on more than it depends on</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.520" end="01:00:13.330" style="s2">institutional life we need cultural</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.290" end="01:00:17.550" style="s2">forms we architecture there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.330" end="01:00:21.940" style="s2">of a fully a full culture is a complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.550" end="01:00:24.430" style="s2">an infinitely complex structure but I</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.940" end="01:00:28.180" style="s2">think we&#39;ve we&#39;ve as it were deleted out</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.430" end="01:00:29.710" style="s2">the memory banks in so many profound</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.180" end="01:00:31.240" style="s2">and so what I&#39;m what I would like to ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.710" end="01:00:32.830" style="s2">you about is the we still have the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.240" end="01:00:34.210" style="s2">libraries we still have the libraries</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.830" end="01:00:35.260" style="s2">well you thank God well thank God for</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.210" end="01:00:37.690" style="s2">that and that&#39;s where I want to turn to</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.260" end="01:00:39.790" style="s2">education because you say in at one</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.690" end="01:00:43.030" style="s2">point you say that we need to rescue the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.790" end="01:00:44.320" style="s2">treasure trove of the past the trestle</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.030" end="01:00:46.510" style="s2">we rescue the values of the treasure</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.320" end="01:00:48.310" style="s2">trove of the past and to integrate them</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.510" end="01:00:50.560" style="s2">and I suppose did like to ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.310" end="01:00:54.190" style="s2">the role the universities are for is to</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.560" end="01:00:55.900" style="s2">remind people to to lead people to doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.190" end="01:00:57.460" style="s2">that I mean we wandered around Cambridge</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.900" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">today and you showed me King&#39;s chapel</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.460" end="01:01:01.359" style="s2">for example which is so beautiful that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:03.490" style="s2">it&#39;s just beyond belief and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:06.280" style="s2">call right that&#39;s it&#39;s a call to a mode</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.490" end="01:01:08.530" style="s2">of being and it&#39;s a Socrates believed</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.280" end="01:01:10.900" style="s2">that all learning was remembering and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.530" end="01:01:13.810" style="s2">and it&#39;s true in the sense that we just</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.900" end="01:01:15.430" style="s2">discussed is that through encounter with</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.810" end="01:01:18.100" style="s2">the tragedy of life and the malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.430" end="01:01:20.170" style="s2">of life that that more of you will come</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.100" end="01:01:24.220" style="s2">to manifest itself but that can be that</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.170" end="01:01:26.410" style="s2">can be facilitated by your incorporation</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.220" end="01:01:28.630" style="s2">of the greatness of the past so you say</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.410" end="01:01:31.480" style="s2">well each great philosopher each great</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.630" end="01:01:34.450" style="s2">thinker is a fragment of the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.480" end="01:01:37.510" style="s2">ancestral being is a fragment of God the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.450" end="01:01:39.070" style="s2">Father let&#39;s say and you get a fragment</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.510" end="01:01:40.540" style="s2">from Nietzsche and you get a fragment</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.070" end="01:01:42.190" style="s2">from Plato and you get a fragment for</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.540" end="01:01:44.770" style="s2">Vidkun Stein and you get a fragment from</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.190" end="01:01:46.810" style="s2">Shakespeare and and and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.770" end="01:01:50.050" style="s2">something imagine this there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.810" end="01:01:52.930" style="s2">that makes all those people great it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.050" end="01:01:55.450" style="s2">whatever greatness is and it&#39;s broken up</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.930" end="01:01:57.820" style="s2">apart it&#39;s broken up across all of them</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.450" end="01:01:59.650" style="s2">but if you and if you experience if</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.820" end="01:02:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;re exposed to each of them then you</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.650" end="01:02:05.500" style="s2">you absorb what&#39;s your you&#39;re exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.520" end="01:02:09.210" style="s2">and have the possibility to imitate and</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.500" end="01:02:11.470" style="s2">absorb that greatness across it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.210" end="01:02:13.570" style="s2">fragmentation across many people and</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.470" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">then you can that can come to awaken</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.570" end="01:02:17.619" style="s2">that within you and that is the purpose</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:19.660" style="s2">of the universities and the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.619" end="01:02:22.510" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t something casual</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.660" end="01:02:24.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like well it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s good to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.510" end="01:02:25.780" style="s2">more if you go to university and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.250" end="01:02:27.940" style="s2">take a humanities degree you&#39;ll come out</p>

<p begin="01:02:27.940" end="01:02:32.740" style="s2">not the that&#39;s not it&#39;s such it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.280" end="01:02:35.050" style="s2">weak way of putting it it&#39;s that no you</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.740" end="01:02:36.460" style="s2">wake up and realize who you are and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.050" end="01:02:38.050" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to take it it&#39;s on your</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.340" end="01:02:48.630" style="s2">because that call isn&#39;t there yes well</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.980" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">there&#39;s no answer to the call you might</p>

<p begin="01:03:15.869" end="01:03:20.010" style="s2">on the feminist end of things is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.730" end="01:03:22.980" style="s2">idea that Western culture is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.010" end="01:03:24.800" style="s2">patriarchal tyranny and so first of all</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.980" end="01:03:27.750" style="s2">we could say well that&#39;s inappropriate</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.800" end="01:03:30.300" style="s2">psychologically because the way that you</p>

<p begin="01:03:34.650" end="01:03:37.770" style="s2">always true but you also have to say</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.270" end="01:03:40.710" style="s2">that there&#39;s the wise king but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.770" end="01:03:42.990" style="s2">no wise king there&#39;s only a tyrant okay</p>

<p begin="01:03:42.990" end="01:03:47.790" style="s2">all male and so and so then and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.050" end="01:03:50.609" style="s2">that&#39;s a view of history right is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.790" end="01:03:53.340" style="s2">the view of history is that well women</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.609" end="01:03:54.720" style="s2">have been a primary force of oppression</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.340" end="01:03:57.450" style="s2">in relationship to women throughout</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.720" end="01:03:59.790" style="s2">history has been men no idea about the</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.790" end="01:04:04.020" style="s2">their mutual desire to lift each other</p>

<p begin="01:04:10.260" end="01:04:14.490" style="s2">tyranny and men are responsible okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.050" end="01:04:17.369" style="s2">well so where does that leave young men</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.490" end="01:04:19.590" style="s2">well let&#39;s say young men are attempting</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.369" end="01:04:22.109" style="s2">to manifest competence in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.590" end="01:04:23.460" style="s2">to become good people well there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.109" end="01:04:25.109" style="s2">good and there&#39;s no competence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.460" end="01:04:27.630" style="s2">only power and it&#39;s related to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.109" end="01:04:29.790" style="s2">patriarchal tyranny and so that</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.630" end="01:04:32.250" style="s2">conflation of competence with power</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.790" end="01:04:36.410" style="s2">which is an absolutely pathological move</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.250" end="01:04:39.750" style="s2">in my estimation is also the desire to</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.410" end="01:04:41.760" style="s2">discourage and to devalue and to destroy</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.750" end="01:04:44.190" style="s2">and partly it&#39;s based on fear because</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.760" end="01:04:46.619" style="s2">the idea would be well a fully-fledged</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.190" end="01:04:48.780" style="s2">man is nothing but a powerful tyrant and</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.619" end="01:04:49.859" style="s2">therefore dangerous better to emasculate</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.780" end="01:04:51.869" style="s2">him completely</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.859" end="01:04:53.850" style="s2">so is nothing but harmless even though</p>

<p begin="01:05:07.950" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">we never talked about so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.470" end="01:05:15.329" style="s2">what&#39;s facing young men is that at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:18.510" style="s2">they&#39;re discouraged from for becoming</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.329" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">what they could be at least they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.510" end="01:05:23.250" style="s2">encouraged but it&#39;s worse than that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:25.970" style="s2">they&#39;re actively discouraged and so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.250" end="01:05:28.529" style="s2">universities have become they&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.970" end="01:05:31.079" style="s2">institutions of active discouragement</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.529" end="01:05:32.970" style="s2">and especially for men and so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.079" end="01:05:34.710" style="s2">consequence of that well especially in</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.970" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">the humanities and social sciences well</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.710" end="01:05:38.819" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious all you have to do is look</p>

<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:05.309" style="s2">they die yes yes it seems to me that the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.690" end="01:07:07.800" style="s2">ideology that&#39;s dominant and very much</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.309" end="01:07:09.770" style="s2">the university is not only just</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.800" end="01:07:14.610" style="s2">attractive in all these ways but chess</p>

<p begin="01:07:31.160" end="01:07:35.160" style="s2">inadequate to its satisfaction what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.300" end="01:07:37.080" style="s2">see in young people today many many</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.160" end="01:07:39.500" style="s2">young people I know you see this in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.080" end="01:07:41.940" style="s2">thousands that you encounter is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.500" end="01:07:44.010" style="s2">they&#39;re not interested in fighting some</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.940" end="01:07:47.040" style="s2">cultural war they simply want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.010" end="01:07:49.860" style="s2">discover the deepest truth of themselves</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.040" end="01:07:51.810" style="s2">and so I want to ask you a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.860" end="01:07:53.310" style="s2">about about the role of Education we</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.810" end="01:07:55.620" style="s2">talked about the lighting up and that</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.310" end="01:07:58.770" style="s2">the awakening the encounter with depth</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.620" end="01:08:00.570" style="s2">and truth you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.770" end="01:08:03.930" style="s2">kind of abstract view of Education as</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.570" end="01:08:05.340" style="s2">though it&#39;s a kind of inert process you</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.930" end="01:08:08.130" style="s2">know you&#39;re just sort of downloading</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.340" end="01:08:12.660" style="s2">into the into the into the mind but in</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.130" end="01:08:16.260" style="s2">fact the nature of our of our of our the</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.660" end="01:08:19.440" style="s2">nature of our souls is such that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.260" end="01:08:21.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a dynamic reality you know the room</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.440" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">is not just the room it&#39;s the place in</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.180" end="01:08:24.299" style="s2">which you and you encounter yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:25.680" style="s2">the in the in the rule of clean up your</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.299" end="01:08:28.230" style="s2">room but it seems to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.680" end="01:08:30.359" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in in in all education</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.230" end="01:08:32.700" style="s2">at its best and that it&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.359" end="01:08:34.170" style="s2">simply for the library to be there there</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.700" end="01:08:36.210" style="s2">needs the certain mediation of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.170" end="01:08:37.890" style="s2">institution so for example ie we could</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.210" end="01:08:39.480" style="s2">have the piano and the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.890" end="01:08:40.890" style="s2">this room you know we could say well</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.480" end="01:08:43.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a piano you&#39;re free to play the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.890" end="01:08:44.940" style="s2">piano but I can&#39;t play the piano I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.319" end="01:08:50.730" style="s2">know the chords and the scales I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.940" end="01:08:54.210" style="s2">and yet if I if I if I did all that then</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.730" end="01:08:56.220" style="s2">what I can make happen on the piano is</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.210" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">infinitely richer than if I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.220" end="01:09:00.060" style="s2">learned to play the piano and I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:01.560" style="s2">I suppose when we talk about rescuing</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.060" end="01:09:03.240" style="s2">the values of the treasure trove that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.560" end="01:09:05.400" style="s2">discipline as the precondition for</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.240" end="01:09:07.260" style="s2">freedom yes right which is which is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.400" end="01:09:08.609" style="s2">which is actually a Nietzschean idea at</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.700" end="01:09:34.080" style="s2">manage that then things open up and</p>

<p begin="01:09:34.080" end="01:09:38.850" style="s2">is like that&#39;s very very very difficult</p>

<p begin="01:10:05.820" end="01:10:10.710" style="s2">definitely the case that disciplinary</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.710" end="01:10:16.050" style="s2">that is their places of guidance and and</p>

<p begin="01:10:19.500" end="01:10:23.370" style="s2">that&#39;s why we have disciplines right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.840" end="01:10:26.070" style="s2">mean the words aren&#39;t there by accident</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.370" end="01:10:28.470" style="s2">you have to narrow yourself first and</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.070" end="01:10:30.210" style="s2">then you can broaden outward and so</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.470" end="01:10:32.370" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s part of the process of</p>

<p begin="01:10:35.460" end="01:10:39.090" style="s2">childhood you&#39;re nothing but potential</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.200" end="01:10:40.830" style="s2">but it&#39;s not realized and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.090" end="01:10:42.120" style="s2">how to realize it and so then the</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.830" end="01:10:43.830" style="s2">question is well how do you get to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.120" end="01:10:46.230" style="s2">point where you realize the potential</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.830" end="01:10:48.300" style="s2">and the answer is you sacrifice almost</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.230" end="01:10:50.580" style="s2">all of it to a single Direction this is</p>

<p begin="01:10:59.190" end="01:11:03.930" style="s2">thing about the Catholic Church is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:06.450" style="s2">it forced everything to be interpreted</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.930" end="01:11:09.390" style="s2">within a single explanatory framework</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.450" end="01:11:11.580" style="s2">and that was a discipline and once that</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.390" end="01:11:13.740" style="s2">discipline was established then the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.580" end="01:11:15.240" style="s2">disciplined mind could explode in every</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.740" end="01:11:18.240" style="s2">direction which is precisely what</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.240" end="01:11:20.100" style="s2">happened and so and and and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.240" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">thing about growing up is that when</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.100" end="01:11:24.150" style="s2">you&#39;re a teenager and a young adult you</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:26.610" style="s2">have to sacrifice everything you could</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.150" end="01:11:28.710" style="s2">have been as a child to be the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.610" end="01:11:30.810" style="s2">that you&#39;re aiming at but then that</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.710" end="01:11:32.820" style="s2">opens up and the universities are part</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.810" end="01:11:35.250" style="s2">and parcel of that process and you need</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.820" end="01:11:38.040" style="s2">the guidance because the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.250" end="01:11:41.160" style="s2">the the library is too large to wander</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.040" end="01:11:42.660" style="s2">through it unaided yes and that and I</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.160" end="01:11:45.690" style="s2">think that hat comes down to to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.660" end="01:11:47.610" style="s2">question of what you need to what what</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.690" end="01:11:49.710" style="s2">are the books that can be read to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.610" end="01:11:52.620" style="s2">transformative I mean we you know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:11:54.390" end="01:11:58.410" style="s2">that light that turns those lights on is</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.190" end="01:12:00.930" style="s2">not just a random otherness I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.410" end="01:12:03.870" style="s2">can look at a brick wall all day and</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.930" end="01:12:05.220" style="s2">never get anything like what we get by</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.870" end="01:12:07.140" style="s2">looking at the King&#39;s chapel that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.220" end="01:12:09.870" style="s2">just came from a few minutes ago that</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.140" end="01:12:11.850" style="s2">that the the levels of pattern and</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.870" end="01:12:17.400" style="s2">depths and beauty that are present in</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.850" end="01:12:21.810" style="s2">that building that&#39;s a kind of metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.400" end="01:12:25.020" style="s2">for what the most wonderful most for</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.810" end="01:12:27.180" style="s2">contexts of our own of our own past</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.020" end="01:12:29.250" style="s2">offered to us you know they&#39;re they are</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.180" end="01:12:34.410" style="s2">lying in the Shelf but when opened up</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.250" end="01:12:37.680" style="s2">and explored fully they in Ostia they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.410" end="01:12:40.170" style="s2">portals so I suppose a book isn&#39;t paper</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.680" end="01:12:42.030" style="s2">yes that that&#39;s that&#39;s your memory</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.170" end="01:12:44.790" style="s2">that&#39;s your perception of the book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.030" end="01:12:47.100" style="s2">a portal yes and and and you know one of</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.790" end="01:12:49.410" style="s2">the ideas the postmodern idea is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.100" end="01:12:51.390" style="s2">well there&#39;s no Canon and if there is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.410" end="01:12:53.190" style="s2">Canon it&#39;s only there to support the</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.390" end="01:12:54.630" style="s2">tyrannical patriarchy because of course</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.190" end="01:12:56.280" style="s2">the tyrannical patriarchy is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.630" end="01:12:58.020" style="s2">explanation for everything but I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.280" end="01:13:00.060" style="s2">trying to solve that problem technically</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.020" end="01:13:01.950" style="s2">with I have a small staff that&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.060" end="01:13:04.230" style="s2">to produce an educational system online</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.950" end="01:13:06.210" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been trying to understand well</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.230" end="01:13:07.860" style="s2">what is it that makes a book canonical</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.210" end="01:13:11.400" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a technical answer to</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.860" end="01:13:13.260" style="s2">that so you imagine that books exist in</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.400" end="01:13:14.820" style="s2">relationship to one another that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.260" end="01:13:16.500" style="s2">perfectly reasonable post modernist</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.820" end="01:13:18.330" style="s2">claim by the way books exist in</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.500" end="01:13:20.580" style="s2">relationship to one another okay well</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.330" end="01:13:23.340" style="s2">some books have hardly any relationship</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.580" end="01:13:25.410" style="s2">to other books those are trivial books</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.340" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">now they might be undiscovered works of</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.410" end="01:13:28.680" style="s2">genius that&#39;s another possibility if</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:30.510" style="s2">they&#39;re recently written but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.680" end="01:13:32.940" style="s2">matter because you can&#39;t separate the</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.510" end="01:13:34.530" style="s2">wheat from the chaff at present it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.940" end="01:13:36.870" style="s2">difficult there&#39;s too much chaff</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.530" end="01:13:38.970" style="s2">but if you go back into the past you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.870" end="01:13:41.790" style="s2">rank order books by the degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.970" end="01:13:44.460" style="s2">they&#39;ve influenced other books so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.790" end="01:13:46.440" style="s2">like citations in some sense and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.460" end="01:13:47.730" style="s2">books that have influenced the largest</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.440" end="01:13:48.690" style="s2">number of other books are the canonical</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.730" end="01:13:50.190" style="s2">books</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.690" end="01:13:52.110" style="s2">and the ultimate canonical book in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.190" end="01:13:53.550" style="s2">West is clearly the biblical corpus</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.110" end="01:13:55.590" style="s2">because it&#39;s influenced virtually</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.550" end="01:13:58.350" style="s2">everything and so you have to know it</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.590" end="01:14:00.570" style="s2">because it&#39;s implicit in everything else</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.350" end="01:14:03.180" style="s2">and so you start there and so you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.570" end="01:14:04.860" style="s2">that you have that knowledge at least to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.180" end="01:14:07.350" style="s2">some degree and it gives you the</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.860" end="01:14:09.719" style="s2">foundation the metaphorical foundation</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.350" end="01:14:12.239" style="s2">the conceptual foundation the mythical</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.239" end="01:14:15.510" style="s2">then maybe you can know that now</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.590" end="01:14:17.610" style="s2">Shakespeare opens up to some degree and</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.510" end="01:14:19.710" style="s2">now Milton opens up to some degree and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.610" end="01:14:21.270" style="s2">Dante opens up to some degree and you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.710" end="01:14:24.480" style="s2">think well why should those open up and</p>

<p begin="01:14:30.420" end="01:14:35.219" style="s2">those books are about you they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.000" end="01:14:37.110" style="s2">the patterns in those books are the</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.880" end="01:14:53.010" style="s2">they say look this is canonical why</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.670" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">because it&#39;s had a disproportionate</p>

<p begin="01:17:34.350" end="01:17:39.930" style="s2">have dozens of young men who come to me</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.200" end="01:17:42.540" style="s2">all the time after my talks and say look</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.930" end="01:17:46.530" style="s2">they give me a note one did last night</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.540" end="01:17:48.600" style="s2">here&#39;s the note six weeks six months ago</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.530" end="01:17:50.400" style="s2">I was deeply suicidal I had no reason to</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.600" end="01:17:52.620" style="s2">live I was completely nihilistic I</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.400" end="01:17:55.920" style="s2">started watching your lectures I started</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.620" end="01:17:57.270" style="s2">to adopt a more responsible outlook I</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.920" end="01:17:58.980" style="s2">realized that that was important I</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.270" end="01:18:01.080" style="s2">started to try to tell the truth and to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.980" end="01:18:03.360" style="s2">put myself together and without that I</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.080" end="01:18:06.630" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be here and that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.360" end="01:18:08.310" style="s2">note and that happens over and over you</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.630" end="01:18:10.470" style="s2">know and then I go talk to journalists</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.310" end="01:18:12.300" style="s2">and this happened in Scandinavia it</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.470" end="01:18:14.070" style="s2">happened with this GQ interview I just</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.300" end="01:18:15.390" style="s2">did well your message is primarily</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.070" end="01:18:17.640" style="s2">directed towards you</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.390" end="01:18:19.470" style="s2">man it&#39;s like and there&#39;s this judgment</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.640" end="01:18:21.390" style="s2">about that it&#39;s like oh there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.470" end="01:18:23.640" style="s2">problem with that is there I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.390" end="01:18:25.200" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the point but that is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.640" end="01:18:27.510" style="s2">audience is what there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.200" end="01:18:29.640" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with talking to</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.510" end="01:18:32.340" style="s2">young men and encouraging them it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.640" end="01:18:34.440" style="s2">that makes me somehow somehow suspicious</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.340" end="01:18:38.360" style="s2">the hatred of humanity that is present</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.440" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">in that critique is mind blow it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.360" end="01:18:42.240" style="s2">absolutely beyond belief and you think</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:44.220" style="s2">well it&#39;s only misogyny it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.240" end="01:18:45.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s like what who are you</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.220" end="01:18:48.840" style="s2">leaving for the women to have as</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.750" end="01:18:50.730" style="s2">partners these did demolished and weak</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.840" end="01:18:53.010" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a zero-sum quality of it I</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.730" end="01:18:55.500" style="s2">mean as if as if as if lifting up any</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.010" end="01:18:57.960" style="s2">human being is not a good for all of us</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.500" end="01:19:00.150" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s the whole point about the</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.960" end="01:19:02.310" style="s2">necessity of our care for the oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.150" end="01:19:04.980" style="s2">is because they are part of us no you</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.310" end="01:19:06.540" style="s2">only care about them in groups the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.980" end="01:19:08.250" style="s2">individual impressed person is</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.540" end="01:19:09.810" style="s2">irrelevant it&#39;s the group of oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.250" end="01:19:11.790" style="s2">people that&#39;s relevant and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.810" end="01:19:14.370" style="s2">just help one person oh well you see</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.790" end="01:19:16.110" style="s2">then then that&#39;s in that&#39;s that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.370" end="01:19:18.000" style="s2">that flies at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.110" end="01:19:19.710" style="s2">collectivist doctrine you say something</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.000" end="01:19:21.420" style="s2">very very powerful when you talked about</p>

<p begin="01:19:21.420" end="01:19:24.960" style="s2">universities in an image that comes to</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.190" end="01:19:26.820" style="s2">my mind is the image of a fountain and</p>

<p begin="01:19:26.820" end="01:19:32.520" style="s2">drink dislike their thirst and and and</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.730" end="01:19:34.350" style="s2">and it seems to me that we need we need</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.520" end="01:19:36.150" style="s2">new institutions of higher education</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.350" end="01:19:38.820" style="s2">that&#39;s the fountain of living water yes</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.150" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">yes yes Moses that&#39;s why Moses is a</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.220" end="01:19:47.970" style="s2">excites me Jordan is that is that what</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.660" end="01:19:50.520" style="s2">we see right now in is is this longing</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.970" end="01:19:53.160" style="s2">there&#39;s so many thirsty people it seems</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.520" end="01:19:55.170" style="s2">to me we simply need to to build new</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.160" end="01:19:57.390" style="s2">fountains because you know as you say</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.170" end="01:20:00.540" style="s2">the books are in the library we can we</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.390" end="01:20:02.760" style="s2">can we can give a rebirth to the past in</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.540" end="01:20:05.040" style="s2">the form of the hunger and thirst that</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.760" end="01:20:06.570" style="s2">are in young people simply by feeding it</p>

<p begin="01:23:04.890" end="01:23:09.900" style="s2">people come up and say you know oh this</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.170" end="01:23:11.580" style="s2">has been so useful to me things were so</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.900" end="01:23:13.560" style="s2">terrible and falling apart in so many</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.580" end="01:23:15.180" style="s2">ways and like all of a sudden I&#39;m just</p>

<p begin="01:23:15.180" end="01:23:19.290" style="s2">them together it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.500" end="01:23:21.150" style="s2">watching the young men who come in and</p>

<p begin="01:24:04.560" end="01:24:08.730" style="s2">that because they&#39;re hoping that I would</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.200" end="01:24:10.530" style="s2">in fact be thrilled to hear that because</p>

<p begin="01:24:39.540" end="01:24:44.730" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely remarkable to see this</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.760" end="01:24:46.920" style="s2">to see how much desperation there is for</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.730" end="01:24:48.750" style="s2">this when I talk to audiences about the</p>

<p begin="01:28:15.389" end="01:28:21.119" style="s2">in that love it&#39;s that the potential</p>

<p begin="01:28:21.119" end="01:28:27.090" style="s2">every individual for deep transformation</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.880" end="01:28:29.610" style="s2">for a connection to the transcendent and</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.090" end="01:28:33.149" style="s2">and and and and and and just to talk</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.610" end="01:28:35.369" style="s2">about that that longing that seems to me</p>

<p begin="01:28:51.959" end="01:28:55.320" style="s2">partly why this is an inflection point</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.309" end="01:28:57.510" style="s2">too because so many things are</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.320" end="01:28:59.639" style="s2">transforming the landscape of</p>

<p begin="01:29:07.499" end="01:29:15.030" style="s2">our ethical choices are becoming more</p>

<p begin="01:29:16.289" end="01:29:20.099" style="s2">reflection of us and so we better make</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.329" end="01:29:22.409" style="s2">sure that it reflects the part of us</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.099" end="01:29:22.920" style="s2">that we want reflected and you talked</p>

<p begin="01:29:35.190" end="01:29:39.510" style="s2">clinical practice and to see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.080" end="01:29:41.699" style="s2">there that unnecessary suffering in that</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.510" end="01:29:44.280" style="s2">malevolence is like well it it would be</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.699" end="01:29:46.080" style="s2">best to move away from that towards</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.280" end="01:29:48.630" style="s2">something better that&#39;s something I</p>

<p begin="01:29:51.000" end="01:29:54.719" style="s2">up and then when I see someone decide to</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.219" end="01:29:57.120" style="s2">aim up I think well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.719" end="01:30:00.210" style="s2">something that&#39;s one more step away from</p>

<p begin="01:30:02.730" end="01:30:06.989" style="s2">the city of god it&#39;s move away from the</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.219" end="01:30:09.360" style="s2">abyss and I think it&#39;s easier for people</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.989" end="01:30:11.040" style="s2">to believe in the abyss it was for me to</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.360" end="01:30:12.780" style="s2">believe in the existence of malevolence</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.040" end="01:30:13.890" style="s2">and apocalypse and catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.780" end="01:30:16.170" style="s2">I mean all you have to do is study</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.890" end="01:30:19.410" style="s2">history to believe that think well not</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.170" end="01:30:21.989" style="s2">that anything but that away from that</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.410" end="01:30:23.850" style="s2">well away from that is amorphous right</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.989" end="01:30:25.800" style="s2">it&#39;s again it&#39;s like Moses leading his</p>

<p begin="01:30:25.800" end="01:30:32.550" style="s2">it&#39;s like well where are we going well</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.370" end="01:30:35.010" style="s2">away from that well that&#39;s into the</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.550" end="01:30:36.540" style="s2">desert and that&#39;s where we are now well</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.010" end="01:30:38.820" style="s2">that&#39;s not so good but at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.540" end="01:30:40.500" style="s2">away from that well that&#39;s something but</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.820" end="01:30:41.730" style="s2">then there&#39;s something beyond that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.500" end="01:30:45.000" style="s2">like well what is it that we&#39;re striving</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.730" end="01:30:46.860" style="s2">towards and and well we can each imagine</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.000" end="01:30:48.660" style="s2">that in our own way in some sense but I</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.860" end="01:30:51.150" style="s2">would say what you start locally is like</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.660" end="01:30:53.310" style="s2">fix up what you can fix up when you see</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.150" end="01:30:55.770" style="s2">a problem that announces itself to you a</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.310" end="01:30:58.350" style="s2">small problem that&#39;s your problem that</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.770" end="01:31:00.840" style="s2">you could fix that&#39;s your one step you</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.350" end="01:31:03.480" style="s2">take it yes it seems to be in addition</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.840" end="01:31:05.699" style="s2">to that that life of the individual we</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.480" end="01:31:09.179" style="s2">we need to think very broadly about the</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.699" end="01:31:12.780" style="s2">institutional life that supports all of</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.179" end="01:31:14.820" style="s2">that individual realization and freedom</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.780" end="01:31:16.380" style="s2">we need to think about universities when</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.820" end="01:31:18.900" style="s2">you think about our architecture we need</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.380" end="01:31:21.900" style="s2">to think about that is to say that that</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.900" end="01:31:25.980" style="s2">the the whole horizon that lies before</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.900" end="01:31:29.760" style="s2">us needs to be considered for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.980" end="01:31:32.820" style="s2">fullness of possibility that that it</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.760" end="01:31:35.550" style="s2">holds and that those possibilities are</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.820" end="01:31:36.600" style="s2">not realizable simply by you know this</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.550" end="01:31:38.670" style="s2">individual doing this</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.600" end="01:31:43.590" style="s2">that ended into doing that but that they</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.670" end="01:31:46.230" style="s2">also require a kind of it requires that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.590" end="01:31:48.840" style="s2">we think about the whole and that we</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.230" end="01:31:52.650" style="s2">allow to give birth we allow to come</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.840" end="01:31:57.600" style="s2">into being the kinds of institutional</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.650" end="01:31:59.820" style="s2">lives institutional life that upon which</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.600" end="01:32:02.160" style="s2">our realization depends upon which that</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.820" end="01:32:04.680" style="s2">awakening depends and so it simply can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.160" end="01:32:07.770" style="s2">be simply a matter of about living our</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.680" end="01:32:10.830" style="s2">lives in a kind of solitary way nobody</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.770" end="01:32:13.290" style="s2">know what we what to think about what</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.830" end="01:32:15.240" style="s2">are the fountains on which you know if</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.290" end="01:32:18.060" style="s2">we&#39;re in the desert it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.240" end="01:32:21.930" style="s2">that okay so we&#39;re in the desert it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.060" end="01:32:23.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lonely and dry place but</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.930" end="01:32:25.710" style="s2">there are the narrative fragments were</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.790" end="01:32:28.050" style="s2">there sure that&#39;s all the deities that</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.710" end="01:32:29.760" style="s2">the Israelites come to worship the false</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.050" end="01:32:32.450" style="s2">idols because the narrative fragments</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.760" end="01:32:35.280" style="s2">and that is the precisely the moment</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.450" end="01:32:37.620" style="s2">paradoxically at which we can rediscover</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.280" end="01:32:39.900" style="s2">ourselves what our what our nature what</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.620" end="01:32:42.410" style="s2">our longing is for and so it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.900" end="01:32:45.950" style="s2">that we&#39;re at a time of astonishing</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.410" end="01:32:48.210" style="s2">possibility but that we must take it up</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.950" end="01:32:49.530" style="s2">well hopefully you know when you train</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.210" end="01:32:51.300" style="s2">graduate students and you train</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.530" end="01:32:54.300" style="s2">undergraduates you know you orient them</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.300" end="01:32:55.980" style="s2">towards the truth and then they learn to</p>
