<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">think we have to turn it around</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">but uh it&#39;s getting harder with every</p>

<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">that almost everyone has had and so in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">some sense</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:44.399" style="s2">that&#39;s simply the nature of the beast at</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:47.439" style="s2">this point</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.399" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">yep okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.439" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">final question from episode 36</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">what is the importance of genitals</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">hormones chromosomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">gonads and secondary sex characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:02:00.159" style="s2">when describing gender</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard them called outdated so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.159" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">a tiny question</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">yeah just a little question uh you want</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:06.799" style="s2">to go on your</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">your usual riff here a little my little</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">tirade um</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">yeah so sex sex is basically binary</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">um the gametes that we produce um</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:21.599" style="s2">uh being the thing that is most</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">fundamental to what sex is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.599" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">if you produce or have produced or might</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">produce or will produce at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">your development</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">in your life history small mobile</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">gametes that have been stripped of most</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">of the cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:34.720" style="s2">plasm you are male and those gametes are</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:35.760" style="s2">called sperm if you&#39;re a plant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.720" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">called pollen</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.760" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">if you produce have produced might</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">produce will produce etc at some point</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">in your life history gametes that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">large and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">sessile don&#39;t move filled with cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:48.959" style="s2">then you are female and those gametes</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">are called eggs</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.959" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">from that truth and we have in our</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">lineage 500 uninterrupted</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">million years of sexual reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">uh wherein you can point to that&#39;s male</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.239" style="s2">that&#39;s female you find a new species</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">you figure out what gametes they produce</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.239" end="00:03:04.480" style="s2">and you know who&#39;s male who&#39;s female</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">even if the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.480" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">organism looks unlike anything else that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:12.720" style="s2">you have ever seen they will have</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">large immobile gametes or small mobile</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.720" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">gametes and that is how you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">gender is the behavioral expression</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:23.599" style="s2">of sex chromosomes in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">mammals and birds different evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.599" end="00:03:28.799" style="s2">um can delineate which sex you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">to become</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.799" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">genitals are primary sexual</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.959" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">that are used to deliver those gametes</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">hormones are physiological mechanisms by</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">sex is displayed</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">and manifest in the body secondary sex</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">um like facial hair and persistent and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">large breasts</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">in women are manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">of the chromosomes of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">of the hormones and all of it stems from</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">originally the binary of sex so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">secondary sex chromosomes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:12.159" style="s2">or rather secondary sex characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">and genitals</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.159" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">are produced by sex why is it that as</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">soon as we get to behavior we decide</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">that these are not correlated this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">totally cultural it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">with evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">um this is a religious standpoint so no</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">it&#39;s not outdated</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.440" style="s2">uh what is outdated is the frankly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">religious approach that suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.440" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">the behavioral manifestation of sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">some of which are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">um kind of old school and we can get rid</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">old-style gender norms we don&#39;t need any</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">but gender is the behavioral expression</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:48.720" style="s2">of sex all these other things are other</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">expressions of sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.720" end="00:04:52.479" style="s2">sex is binary gender isn&#39;t but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:53.919" style="s2">still strongly bimodal</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.479" end="00:04:55.680" style="s2">all right so if i can just add a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.919" end="00:04:59.840" style="s2">things please um</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.680" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">one 500 million good years of sex</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.840" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not a bad run they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">also good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.639" style="s2">all right i don&#39;t know i wasn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:09.199" style="s2">for all of them yeah true</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.639" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">the thing that i sometimes hear you say</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.199" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">um the gamete issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">is wildly correlated with the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">downstream things there&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">ambiguous genitals and things but in</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">general the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">gametes which are binary are predictive</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:28.080" style="s2">of the chromosomes that you will find in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.720" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">the cells they are predictive of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.080" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">secondary sexual characteristics that</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">you will find</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">and they are predictive of the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">not all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">but almost all the time they are</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">predictive of it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">the meaning of this which we rarely get</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">is that gender being the software of sex</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.479" end="00:05:49.120" style="s2">that software</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">fits the difference in gametes which</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.120" end="00:05:52.479" style="s2">predicts a difference in reproductive</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">and females that we find in culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.880" style="s2">after culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">derive so cross culture across time over</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.880" end="00:06:04.800" style="s2">and over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re being misled about</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.800" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">is that the software</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">is arbitrary because it&#39;s software it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">could be anything you could swap out</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:13.120" style="s2">male characteristics for females</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:15.199" style="s2">no you can&#39;t the reason you can&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.120" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">because the strategy derives</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.199" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">from the biological underpinnings</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">that trace all the way back to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.280" style="s2">difference in gamete size</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">which is universal and sexual creatures</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.280" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">yeah it emerges in part from a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">cultural blank slatism</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">which emerges itself in part at least in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:34.560" style="s2">academic circles from</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">cultural anthropology&#39;s missteps in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.560" end="00:06:39.520" style="s2">middle of the last century</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">um in which it was uh it was argued</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.520" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">successfully apparently such that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">entire field is mostly captured now</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">uh that culture is is arbitrary and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">uh whatever one culture is doing could</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">just as easily have been a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">suite of things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">no it&#39;s not true you know culture fits</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">the environment in which the people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">who have created that culture live and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">similarly</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">uh the behavior of sex fits the sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">that uh the environment in which the</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">different sexes have</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">experienced life and you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.599" style="s2">environment changes and obviously it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:13.360" style="s2">changing very rapidly now</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.599" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">gender norms will change as well and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.360" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">they will become more fluid and we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:21.919" style="s2">we can have a much less uh old-school</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">old-fashioned archaic regressive</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">of what women are supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:29.360" style="s2">and what men are supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">but we can&#39;t imagine that it was</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.360" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">arbitrary from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">that it had no uh that it had no reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:36.400" style="s2">for being</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">or that it is going to be possible to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.400" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">get rid of all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:42.960" style="s2">uh that are effectively behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:46.720" style="s2">downstream effects of sex</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.960" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">so um the way to remember this</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.720" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">is that even if you look at plants the</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">parts that</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">are male are much more enthusiastic for</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">example about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">having sex with other plants</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">than the female parts right that&#39;s they</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">don&#39;t do a life history first</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:04.639" style="s2">they just go and have sex right and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">thing is it&#39;s for the same reason that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.639" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">you find this</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">in animals which is that the females the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">large gamete</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">is the beginning of this strategy in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">which females are predisposed to greater</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">investment in offspring which causes</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">choosiness to pay back</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:20.319" style="s2">so if you can find that in a plant that</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">literally doesn&#39;t think about anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.319" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">it&#39;s incapable</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">of being culturally oppressed or</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:27.039" style="s2">anything else now you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">pissed off the plant enthusiasts</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.039" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">and the maybe even the plants that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">conscious plant enthusiasts yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:35.919" style="s2">um but anyway the fact is this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">ancient pattern and it&#39;s there for</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.919" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">reasons that aren&#39;t that hard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">it didn&#39;t get invented in humans it</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t invented by a patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not time to introduce</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">some changes we can renegotiate the deal</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">between the sexes but let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">pretend it doesn&#39;t arise out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">something comprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">and and certainly aspects of this have</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">been taken advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">uh by by regimes and by individuals</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">throughout history 100</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">just just like with with race you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">we when we say this we are not claiming</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">uh that you know that sexism isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been real and but</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">but but and i don&#39;t know that i&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">said this anywhere else just like</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">historical racism has been much worse in</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">the us</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">in the past than it is now historical</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:23.680" style="s2">sexism has been much worse in the past</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:26.720" style="s2">than it is now</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.680" end="00:09:29.760" style="s2">and so these hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:31.760" style="s2">and frankly just flat-out wrong claims</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.760" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">that sexism is an all-time high and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.760" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">racism is an all-time high</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">you we just know this isn&#39;t true and</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">therefore you can start to suspect</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">almost anything that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">else that comes out of such people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.760" style="s2">mouths when they make those claims</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.480" style="s2">absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.760" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">okay on to the first question from um</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.480" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">from today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">live stream from</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">from tommy unique name would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">consider using score voting instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">ranked choice voting</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.560" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">i recommend podcast 2012 106</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:02.800" style="s2">october 6th interview with nobel</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.640" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">dr arrow says that</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:09.600" style="s2">score voting is probably the best in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:11.760" style="s2">practice i didn&#39;t recognize i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.600" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">recognize score voting as a term but</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.760" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">um obviously arrow is a is a person who</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">is familiar to both of us</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:19.279" style="s2">yes he is actually the person on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:21.839" style="s2">because he</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.279" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">proved uh arrow&#39;s impossibility theorem</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.839" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">was that there was no mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">uh no voting system that you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">institute that would get</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">a vote inherently to represent the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.079" style="s2">actual will of the people now</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">the system we have is particularly bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.079" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">and i take it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">that um ken arrow&#39;s indication</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">of score voting uh means that although</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">he has proven that it can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:47.279" style="s2">represent it</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.200" style="s2">perfectly that it is much closer to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.279" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">representing it so presumably there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.200" end="00:10:52.079" style="s2">scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">of the degree to which a voting system</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.079" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">represents the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">will of the people that is to say um</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">the collective output of not only</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:03.760" style="s2">the order of preferences but the degree</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">of preferences that weights these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.760" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">so anyway i&#39;d be certainly interested in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">looking into it there is a question</p>

<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">superior to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.440" end="00:11:18.880" style="s2">first past the post so rank choice</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">voting is one possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.880" end="00:11:22.480" style="s2">score voting is apparently another and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about the practical</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.480" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">details of getting this into some system</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.480" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">that actually works</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.519" style="s2">which is something that we face inside</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">unity 2020 and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.519" end="00:11:33.040" style="s2">ranked choice voting is good enough</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">maybe score voting is better</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.040" end="00:11:36.399" style="s2">hopefully score voting is both better</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">and easier to implement and</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">uh yeah i&#39;d be happy to look into it</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">choice as a fallback</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">yep so this is what this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.760" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">plan is maybe score voting would be</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">yep and long term but but the but the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">default</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">the default plan is rank choice which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">the same as rank order</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">well i don&#39;t want to promise anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:48.320" style="s2">because the implementation layer</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">is not my purview and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.320" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">doing it are you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">stretched pretty thin but yes our</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">objective is to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">as well as we can yeah and am i right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">i just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">i&#39;m out of my depth here ranked choice</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">and ranked ordered voting is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:04.720" style="s2">i certainly think so yeah yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">this question is four questions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">they&#39;re big ones</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">are more males born after wars do</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">attractive parents have more girls</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">if either what&#39;s the mechanism does</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">anybody know</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">um so these are those are actually two</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.600" style="s2">questions although they&#39;re both related</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">to well the first one is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.600" end="00:13:28.000" style="s2">related to the question of sex ratios</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:31.200" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.000" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">and uh the second one is</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.200" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">a little bit the one about attractive</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">parents having more girls is a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">uh related to sex ratios but more</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:41.199" style="s2">um more to the question of sexual</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:44.240" style="s2">selection and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.199" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">how as parents can you maximize um</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.240" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">your genes going forward bitch you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">as we&#39;ve said over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">again it&#39;s an uninteresting goal and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">um this is sort of the least of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">parents do um but it obviously still is</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">part of what parents do</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">is uh leaving copies of themselves the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.279" style="s2">next generation</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">hear that zach all right yeah he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.279" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">on it um</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">so are more males born after wars so</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:09.120" style="s2">you can do a number of things here first</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">of all just to make it clear why you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.120" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">would expect it</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">is that wars tend to eliminate men they</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">don&#39;t just eliminate men</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">right wartime is bad for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:20.399" style="s2">things for all sorts of reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">because men fight wars and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:24.480" style="s2">that is a cultural universal</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:25.440" style="s2">yes um that men do the actual fighting</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.480" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">they are killed</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.440" end="00:14:29.839" style="s2">at greater rates which would leave you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:31.199" style="s2">to expect that the production of men</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.839" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">well there&#39;s two ways to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.199" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">you could think about it at a lineage</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:35.440" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">where there is a need for men and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.440" end="00:14:39.120" style="s2">could think of it at</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">the individual level that is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.120" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">from the point of view of a parent</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">physiologically choosing whether to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">produce a male or a female</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">females are liable to be in surplus</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:49.279" style="s2">males are liable to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">scarce and therefore a male that you had</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.279" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">after war might be disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:53.279" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">both of which can be understood from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.279" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">sex racial perspective which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:14:59.519" style="s2">um it&#39;s fisher right who does sex ratio</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:01.680" style="s2">stuff um so r.a fisher</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.519" end="00:15:03.360" style="s2">the father of minor statistics and one</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.680" end="00:15:04.639" style="s2">of the best evolutionary biologists of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.360" end="00:15:07.199" style="s2">the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.639" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">one of his contributions was</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.199" end="00:15:11.760" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">that um not even all else being equal</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.760" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">but in almost every circumstance in</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">almost every circumstance there are</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:18.079" style="s2">exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">uh we expect the sex ratio at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.079" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">average age of first reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">uh to uh be one to one in populations</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">um and you know his logic is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">population level logic</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">uh which says basically if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">abundance of one sex</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">parents who can influence uh the sex</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">ratio of their own offspring</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">will end up having better luck in</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">producing grand offspring</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">if they produce the sex that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">currently underrepresented in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">so i would point out that there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">outgrowth of this discussion i wrote an</p>

<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">surplus of males that females would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.519" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">prized as offspring which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.800" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">opposite of what we see well it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not the one child policy</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">itself does not either predict this nor</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">violate</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">uh what fisher found and revealed about</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:31.279" style="s2">sex ratios it is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">cultural valuing of boy children over</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.279" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">girl children overlaid on a one child</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">policy that then produces too many boys</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:39.279" style="s2">such that you have um not enough not</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:40.560" style="s2">enough girls and therefore and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.279" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">after not enough women</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.560" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">right so the question in this case</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">is first of all uh is there conflict</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:52.000" style="s2">between the population level analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">and the individual level analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.000" end="00:16:55.600" style="s2">in the aftermath of war and which one</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">should dominate because after all</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.600" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">at least our argument is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">lineages that fight wars</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">typically and that that means that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:05.120" style="s2">are serving a lineage level purpose</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:07.039" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.120" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">conflict though you know i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.039" end="00:17:09.760" style="s2">it depends on the war</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">wow right it depends on the context you</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.760" end="00:17:12.959" style="s2">know if if an area has been so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">devastated</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.959" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">that uh most of the men have been killed</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">and the women have been either enslaved</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">and removed or</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">raped and inseminated um you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">necessarily well if they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">enslaved and removed then you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">necessarily have a sex ratio difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">right um but if uh if</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">if the women are still there and even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">they now have</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">within them the children of the of their</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">captors their warlords um you have</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">uh a a likely move both at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">individual level and the population</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">uh to produce more males yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:55.120" style="s2">potentially there&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:57.039" style="s2">possibility here</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.120" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">which is that you would see polygeny</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.039" end="00:17:59.919" style="s2">break out in the aftermath of wars which</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">actually i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.919" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">predicted would be likely because it</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense to sideline</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">um women reproductively just because</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:12.559" style="s2">you know an equal number of men so in</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">other words one man can fertilize many</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.559" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">in the absence of men as a result of war</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:20.000" style="s2">you might imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:21.520" style="s2">um that all women who were capable of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.000" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">producing offspring would end up</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.520" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">with offspring which i have argued is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:28.559" style="s2">basis for</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:30.240" style="s2">um lesbian coupling that lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.559" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">coupling a lesbian couple is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.240" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">capable of raising offspring</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">and gametes aren&#39;t that hard to get so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.720" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">not if you&#39;re a woman</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:39.520" style="s2">not if you&#39;re a woman um so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:43.039" style="s2">question here but the the one i the</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">piece i want to point out</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.039" end="00:18:47.760" style="s2">is that warfare is frequently going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">happen at least by our model</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.760" end="00:18:53.840" style="s2">when um there when there is a deficit of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">resources in other words austerity</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.840" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">causes populations to go to war so in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">one sense if</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">you were going to do this analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">maybe that the analysis has been done</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">and maybe that peter turton knows the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">answer to this question for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">but yeah we don&#39;t we don&#39;t know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">talking from an evil</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:09.520" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to make the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">predictions but we don&#39;t actually know</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.520" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">the answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">right yeah but it may be that the answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">is different depending upon whether you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.160" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">want or lost</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">right i would imagine that that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">has some important implications</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:21.919" style="s2">100 and i i guess i was speaking from</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">the assumption that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.919" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">the losers</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:27.200" style="s2">right yeah um but the other thing is if</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">austerity is generating this</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.200" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">and we have made arguments in other</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">places for mechanisms to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">austerity from causing conflict from</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">causing violence but in the case that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">such mechanisms don&#39;t exist or haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">worked and you have violence in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">sense what it may be doing is backing</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">the population away from carrying</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">which if you do the individual level</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">you would expect to have very little</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:53.039" style="s2">implication because an individual</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">just because the population may be</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.039" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">better off backing away from</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">carrying capacity the individual still</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">has an evolutionary interest</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">in creating as many copies as they can</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">in the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">on the other hand if we start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">in lineage level terms which i would</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.559" style="s2">argue we always should</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">that at a lineage level it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.559" end="00:20:12.799" style="s2">different analysis because the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">well-being of a lineage may indeed</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">allow for some kind of restraint with</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.840" style="s2">respect to immediate</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:21.679" style="s2">moving the immediate move back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.840" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">carrying capacity well but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.679" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">we have argued i&#39;m not sure that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">argued publicly yet but you know it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in our book that</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">uh that monogamy actually is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">filling a landscape more quickly and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">um yes you of course if you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">below carrying capacity you expect birth</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">rate to go up to sort of an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:42.240" style="s2">but you also expect a move further away</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.480" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">from polygamy towards monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.240" end="00:20:45.760" style="s2">as there are more resources available</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.919" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">and more landscape to move into</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.760" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">so i&#39;m alluding to that what i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">is that if you have an oscillation at</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.480" style="s2">the at carrying capacity and warfare</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">results from</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.480" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">some boost in population above normal</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">carrying capacity that then results in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">violence and the violence is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2">bloodletting that removes some people</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:08.320" style="s2">from the population</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">the evolutionary drive</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.320" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">to go into a population increase mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:15.039" style="s2">that would be facilitated by monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">which brings all</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.039" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">potential parents into child rearing</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">that that might not be incentivized</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">right so anyway let&#39;s just say this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:25.520" style="s2">complex question sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">um it may be that the pattern you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.520" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">hypothesize</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">is there in a general sense it may be</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">that it&#39;s there for</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">uh winners and not losers or vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:37.120" style="s2">or it may be that it&#39;s absent for other</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:38.880" style="s2">reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.120" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">dominate the question that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.880" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s certainly worth looking into</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:45.760" style="s2">yeah now as to the maybe we&#39;ve spent as</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:48.240" style="s2">much time as we should on this one but</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.760" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">uh do attractive parents have more girls</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.240" end="00:21:51.360" style="s2">uh and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">i guess i first read that more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.360" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">not as attractive but sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:56.400" style="s2">higher quality whatever that means which</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.000" style="s2">would be a direct allusion to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.400" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">traverse willard hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.000" end="00:22:04.960" style="s2">which was published in mid-70s probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:06.480" style="s2">which suggests that because put humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.960" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">aside for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.480" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">because the variability in reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">success is so much greater for males</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:15.360" style="s2">than it is for females that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">is um that females no matter</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.360" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">how many matings they get no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">the social system is tend to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">you know roughly two surviving offspring</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:24.400" style="s2">that make it into the next generation</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">that then go on to reproduce themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.400" end="00:22:28.559" style="s2">that is they exactly replace themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.000" end="00:22:29.600" style="s2">in a in a stable population situation</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.559" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">whereas males</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.600" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">have a highly variable number of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">offspring</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">and how many they have varies greatly by</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">the number of reproductive opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">that they find for themselves or make</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:42.799" style="s2">for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">so the prediction of the trevor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.799" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">wheeler hypothesis is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">the higher the quality offspring you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">produce the more likely you</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">are to produce males because because</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">males have such a greater variability in</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:57.520" style="s2">reproductive success</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:59.200" style="s2">you want to make sure that your highest</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.520" end="00:23:00.880" style="s2">quality offspring are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.200" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">males with a higher variability with a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.880" end="00:23:03.840" style="s2">higher chance of getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">more offspring themselves this is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.840" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">purely genetic argument</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">and obviously with humans where we tend</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">towards monogamy</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">and where female beauty in particular is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">a big predictor of basically wealth</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:18.159" style="s2">acquisition and also reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.159" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">this may this may at least um mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">the effects of trevor&#39;s willard or even</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">flip it on its head</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">wait wait wait i was with you until that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">last okay well i didn&#39;t say it will i</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.080" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">said it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">it may no no i i thought where you were</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">headed</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">um is that uh all else being equal</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:39.039" style="s2">a very important phrase here all else</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">being equal</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.039" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">prettier women should tend to have male</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">offspring</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">because of the downstream consequences</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">in mating and dating so not only of male</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">beauty</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">no i thought we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">female beauty right well but so you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:57.279" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">women beautiful women should be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.279" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">likely to have male offspring</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">but if it&#39;s because of the role of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">female beauty in mating and dating why</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t you expect a flip of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">trevor&#39;s willard because</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:10.159" style="s2">uh beautiful women would be more likely</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">therefore to</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.159" end="00:24:14.880" style="s2">uh to themselves again attract more</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:16.640" style="s2">high quality mates yeah higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:17.600" style="s2">mates they would they would they would</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.640" end="00:24:21.520" style="s2">tend to marry</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.600" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">up and therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.520" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">chances that a male offspring that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">produce would be successful would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">higher than if we take their</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">beauty out of the equation and we figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">out where they would have made it in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:35.279" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">based on other characteristics so if a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">woman can marry</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">up it should increase the chances of her</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">producing male offspring</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">because the offspring will be better</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.880" style="s2">placed to</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">reproduce themselves and she&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.880" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">likely to produce dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">so how is that different how how does</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">the human situation that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">classic</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">trevor&#39;s willard argument that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">change in any way like</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:24:59.840" style="s2">so the fact of female beauty or not</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t even belong in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.840" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s changed the argument</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">not at all</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">well right i think this is standard</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:07.279" style="s2">trooper&#39;s bullet i don&#39;t know i i have</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.000" style="s2">yet to see why</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.279" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">why the logic would reverse here um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.000" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">just that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">beauty plays a certain role in human</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">mating and dating</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">and so i mean because there&#39;s choice</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">because because both men and women</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">choose</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s right um to to a greater</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.600" style="s2">degree than</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">uh really is found in just about any</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.600" end="00:25:26.480" style="s2">other mammals and there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:29.919" style="s2">monogamous species of birds but</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.480" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">um in in a mostly monogamous species as</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.919" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">as we are where you have choice on on</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">both parts and where</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">female beauty and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">indicators of youth and fertility</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:44.799" style="s2">are highly prized across culture uh you</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">might expect a woman with those</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.799" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.880" style="s2">um to exactly want to replicate them in</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">her daughters because she will want</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.880" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">daughters who will be similarly chosen</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">by also highly ranked men because female</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">beauty doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">convert into the indicators that says</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:02.559" style="s2">for men right like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">you know if success for men is often</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.559" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">about wealth and um</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">and you know later in life success now i</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:10.240" style="s2">get your argument</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">okay but i still think it goes the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.240" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">precisely because of the thing that sits</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">at the bottom of the trevor&#39;s willard</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">analysis which is that the variance for</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:20.559" style="s2">women is lower and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">so first of all no matter no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.559" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">else is true about humans still there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">only so many kids a woman can have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">her lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">and the number of kids a man can have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">his lifetime is basically unbounded but</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">don&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:32.799" style="s2">right but so anyway just just to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">complete it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.799" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">if woman so first of all there is there</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.559" style="s2">are several layers</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">playing into this discussion one is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.559" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">a beautiful woman</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">is likely genetically well endowed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">has had access to resources</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">that or her mother did that would result</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">in you know this is one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:52.480" style="s2">that bob trivers has looked deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">um is the fluctuating fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.480" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">specialization</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">basically we find symmetry uh pleasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">a woman who is beautiful likely is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">genetically well endowed and has also</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:03.679" style="s2">had a developmental environment that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">hospitable</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.679" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">um which uh you know some of this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">heritable and some of it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.279" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">right but a beautiful woman is probably</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">if those characteristics are right</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">if she&#39;s especially symmetrical for one</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">thing she may also it&#39;s not that her</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not that she is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">producing female beauty she is likely</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">capable of producing</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">beautiful well put together offspring of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">either sex</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">she is also capable of commanding more</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">in the mating and dating market</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">and therefore she you know let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:34.640" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.520" style="s2">male quality physical quality doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.640" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">even matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.520" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">right certain things like a higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">position in society</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">she can marry somebody who&#39;s a higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">position in society which increases the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">chances that her offspring</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">will be able to find mates although</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">until until very recently until</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:51.520" style="s2">post-industrial cultures</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">often higher position in society for</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.520" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">males needed to be vetted with</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">uh tests of physical prowess early on</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">yep i still i still think that all these</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">things point in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">that which is that whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">female beauty is a proxy for whether it</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:11.520" style="s2">you know mediated through males who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">choosing or whether it is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.520" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">through nature and her ability to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.440" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">offspring that are well structured in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">both cases the unsettling and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.679" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">uncomfortable conclusion of trevor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">willard</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">is if you have some reason to know that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">your offspring</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">are liable to be more capable than</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">average rather than less capable than</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">average</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">then you should tend to produce males</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">and in a more uncertain context you</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">should tend to produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">females and that female beauty if it</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">does anything it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">she should be more likely to produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">males because she&#39;s more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.399" style="s2">males that are well positioned and well</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">structured fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.399" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">okay we could we could of course go on</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:48.320" style="s2">for hours as we probably will later yes</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.320" end="00:28:51.679" style="s2">off the camera um and i will say and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">maybe correct me i</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.679" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">you know i didn&#39;t didn&#39;t see this</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">question coming but i think i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">that trevor</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:58.559" style="s2">willard has been investigated with</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">regard to mechanism in humans or even</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.559" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">investigated</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">necessarily in humans at all but it has</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">been looked at in some</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">species of mammals where the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">actually appears to possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">choice of the egg now by the egg of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:13.200" style="s2">particular sperm</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.320" style="s2">because mammals have chromosomal sex</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.200" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">determination</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.320" end="00:29:17.760" style="s2">um i believe and you know it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">i&#39;m just making this up but i but i</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.760" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">i think i remember one or two papers</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">suggesting that basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:26.080" style="s2">the egg knows and obviously none of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">is conscious we&#39;re using this</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.080" end="00:29:30.720" style="s2">evolutionary shorthand but</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">the egg can tell x sperm versus y sperm</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.720" end="00:29:34.559" style="s2">in a mammal and b z versus w sperm in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">bird no</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.559" end="00:29:36.880" style="s2">actually in birds it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">totally different because they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.880" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">this different sexes heterogametic</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">in birds um but in mammals x-sperm</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">versus y-sperm the egg can tell and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">therefore the egg can make choices based</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">on the sex of the sperm that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.559" style="s2">approaching them</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">and appears to do so i will try to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.559" end="00:29:52.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">find that to make sure that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.880" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">making it up for the next time</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">all right good all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">uh the next question is also</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">evolutionary which is good because it</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">would be really hard to switch</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">after that um is there an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">advantage to being colorblind</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:12.640" style="s2">okay it quickly goes non-evolutionary in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">your case brett does it help to not fall</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.640" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">for the vote red or vote blue dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">thoughts on oh and now totally different</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">within the same question thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">doubling the number of reps we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:24.399" style="s2">435</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">for almost 100 years could more seats</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.399" end="00:30:27.760" style="s2">mean less government capture</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:32.159" style="s2">i&#39;m probably going to punt on that last</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">bit i would have to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.159" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">about the implications they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">immediately obvious to me but let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">about uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">color blindness yeah first of all you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:43.279" style="s2">should know eric and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">have an unusual kind of colorblindness</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.279" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">red green we have the identical color</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.279" end="00:30:49.679" style="s2">blindness which we know because there</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:53.039" style="s2">are these</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">marvelous pebble tests that assess which</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.039" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">cones are doing what where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">probably seen them</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a round display that has these</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.399" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">different sized dots in it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">number written in the dots the salient</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">thing about them is</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">they&#39;re differently colored dots right</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing that you may not</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">know because most people see color</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:14.480" style="s2">approximately the same way is that some</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">of those tests</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.480" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">have a number in the in them that only a</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">person with a certain kind of color</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">blindness can see and eric and i see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">same thing on these charts</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:24.880" style="s2">just one chart after another so 90 of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">seven and ninety percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">remaining people see nothing and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">ten percent of the one percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">and these numbers are all wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">much less than one percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">population that has this particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">color blindness see the number two</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">instead which no one else can see at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">right yeah um so eric and i could go</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">through the book separately and we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">come up with exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">answers and people who see color</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">normally would all be in an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">about what they saw too</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">so anyway the the reason i raised that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">is because red green color blindness</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:01.679" style="s2">pretty clearly does have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">advantage and marvelously the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.679" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">seems not to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">an individual level advantage it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">population level advantage in other</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you&#39;d all be better off</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">being colorblind but you&#39;re better off</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.480" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">in a population that has some colorblind</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">people just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">you are better off being in a population</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:21.600" style="s2">that has some left-handers</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:22.559" style="s2">and so there is clearly and i find that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.600" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">this is true for</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.559" end="00:32:25.919" style="s2">me too with my color blindness is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:28.880" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.919" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">is an increased sensitivity to pattern i</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.880" end="00:32:31.440" style="s2">can find things other people can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.440" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">we don&#39;t know you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">visual pattern but i wonder if it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:36.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">track into other kinds of pattern as</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.240" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">well well i think it has all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.799" style="s2">downs analytical patterns</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">yeah for one thing i think it just</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.799" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">there&#39;s probably something to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">that if you live in a world of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">who agree what color stuff is and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:51.840" style="s2">seeing we&#39;re not lying you see it well</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.840" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">believe me one of my favorite things is</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:57.200" style="s2">when you color normies</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">get into a disagreement about what color</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.200" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">something is that really warms my heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">like moe versus taupe</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">whatever it is i&#39;ve seen some crazy</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">arguments and i like to just sit back</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">and listen</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">because usually it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">me who&#39;s off and i know it</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">well can i can i just claim oppression</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.240" style="s2">status here that i live in a very small</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">population of four here in the nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.240" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">family and i passed</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:20.399" style="s2">to our two children my father&#39;s red</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.320" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">green colorblind gene</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.399" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">i of course don&#39;t i mean i carry it but</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t manifest in me because</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">it&#39;s on the x and it gets it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">recessive</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">so i live in a family with three</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:32.000" style="s2">colorblind people</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">uh varying degrees you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.000" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">different types but uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:39.039" style="s2">but i&#39;m me me the color norm you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">actually in the minority</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.039" end="00:33:43.039" style="s2">but look i do think there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">the experience of like</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.039" end="00:33:47.360" style="s2">week after week seeing a world with your</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.000" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">own eyes i mean it&#39;s very compelling</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.360" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">what you see with your eyes and then to</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">have the world say no you&#39;re not seeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">what you think you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">does lead you a to have the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">of um well sometimes you do see</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">something that other people can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">you know i i never knew whether my</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">dissertation work on tent making bats</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">was facilitated by the fact that because</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t see color normally</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">the bats were less successful at</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">deceiving me</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">with their tents so after i figured out</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:17.359" style="s2">the trick of how to find these things</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">i got very good at it and i could find</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.359" end="00:34:20.639" style="s2">sometimes you know 200 in a day if i you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.639" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">was really trying um now and these</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">things are these things are</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:28.480" style="s2">super hard to find they&#39;re right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s hard when the first time you walk</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.480" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">into a lowland rainforested jungle a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:32.960" style="s2">tropical jungle</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:34.399" style="s2">you can&#39;t see anything but a wall of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.960" end="00:34:36.000" style="s2">green but even once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.399" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">spent you know years wandering around</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.000" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">these forests um it&#39;s much harder for me</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">to find these things than for you and i</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">know exactly what i&#39;m looking for at</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">this point right yeah you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">hundreds of them yeah um so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s all an aside the point is</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">yes there is an advantage the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">may come</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">in the form of just the same way we</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">colorize pictures from jupiter for</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">example to highlight different things</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">that the normal color image of the red</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:03.440" style="s2">spot reveals different things than a</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">false color image</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.440" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">having some people who just have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">different color wheel in operation</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">reveals things that will be hidden um it</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">is certainly true</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">that during world war ii i believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">yeah world war ii colorblind</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">people were used to spot camouflage from</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">airplanes because they were less easily</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">deceived by the color of the camouflage</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:26.880" style="s2">and that that pattern may be more</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">general but it may also just have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.880" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">cultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">impact where if you have the experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">of being out of sync with your</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">population and what it sees</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">it may train you to be um a little more</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">dogged when you think you see something</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">that other people don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:43.680" style="s2">you pursue it and they say no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">getting it wrong and it&#39;s like am i</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.680" end="00:35:45.680" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.440" style="s2">no and we&#39;ve talked about this in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.680" end="00:35:50.160" style="s2">number of places um that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.440" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">um you know there may be particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.160" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">ability to detect pattern because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">not focusing on the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">people are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">to colorblindness but you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:35:59.599" style="s2">left-handedness</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">um being on the spectrum you know all</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.599" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">these sorts of forms of neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">um basically you know any</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">any way that you are walking through</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">life such that you&#39;re not effectively</p>

<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">to use to use that language um puts you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">out of step enough that you may start</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:17.040" style="s2">questioning other things that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">else is accepting</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.040" end="00:36:21.359" style="s2">yeah and you know you can force this</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">expats sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.359" end="00:36:24.480" style="s2">have an interesting perspective being</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">um as you know it is for most of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">activists for instance and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">just be there among other people doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:42.960" style="s2">their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:43.920" style="s2">and watch how many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.960" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">you thought were just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.920" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">fundamental to being human</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">are just done differently over here and</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">sometimes it matters and sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sometimes it&#39;s random</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">and sometimes most of the time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">usually if it&#39;s persistent whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">they&#39;re doing is better in their</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">environment whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.520" style="s2">it was happening over here was better in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:04.240" style="s2">this environment and uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.520" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">and it just it reveals a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.240" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">biases that we actually carry around</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">with us</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">about sort of just what it is to be a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">human a man</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">an american whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">yep all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">next question i made</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">daniel made a new social deduction game</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">based on medieval era</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">called long live the king that you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">find at guiltfreegaming.com</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">long live the king it was criticized for</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">the lack of diversity</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">and he says it was based in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">era should games ignore historical truth</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">for more inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">would this change help anyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:44.720" style="s2">well this is this is a good question</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">yeah you and i have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:47.599" style="s2">this question</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">not in the context of games but in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.599" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">context of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">plays theater theater yeah so we may</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">go and say more about this soon but i</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">judgment call and i believe that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">is a proper place for the line</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">and the aspiration to be inclusive i</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">is honorable there is a level at which</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">the implementation can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">absolutely wrong so we&#39;ve seen plays for</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">example where</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">um the you know every time you go and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">see a play or</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">start watching a new movie or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:25.200" style="s2">you have to get used to who the</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">characters are what their relationships</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:29.359" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">and um having</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.359" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">enough data to do it well is important</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">in the case that the parents of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">child in the play are of a different</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">race</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">and it causes the mind to just when it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">tracks normal logic of these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.119" style="s2">to throw an error and it causes it to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">harder to figure out who the characters</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.119" end="00:38:50.480" style="s2">are and remember when they show up</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">what their relationship is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.480" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">disruptive of the purpose of the play</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">and probably not a good place to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">on the other hand and you know just</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:38:59.920" style="s2">genetically nonsensical</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">unless in the play the kid was adopted</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.920" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">right right right</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:05.839" style="s2">but that said there are lots of places</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:09.359" style="s2">where you can do things we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.839" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">um the sex of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.359" end="00:39:14.800" style="s2">character reversed in places yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">you know it can be done very badly and</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.800" end="00:39:19.839" style="s2">it can also be done well</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">um we&#39;ve seen races that would not have</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.839" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:25.359" style="s2">uh represented in the places where the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">play is taking place places and times</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.359" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">and we&#39;ve seen it done well um we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">also seen cases in which</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">you know who was it</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">in othello i think but um anyway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.560" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">a place where uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">the moore shows up anyway the point is</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">you are simultaneously trying to correct</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:47.599" style="s2">a historical bias and trying to provide</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.599" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">data for the mind to be able to track</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:54.400" style="s2">what&#39;s going on but should it</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:55.599" style="s2">so we&#39;ve seen plays from a number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.400" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">theater companies</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.599" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">now recently in the last really 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.440" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been noticing this</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">and the ones that we keep going back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.440" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">just because of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">geographically but also because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">putting on really high quality theater</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:09.440" style="s2">are all playing around with the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:10.560" style="s2">and um sometimes they&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.440" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">brilliantly and sometimes they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.560" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">it really badly</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">and uh we hope to see them improving</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">over time assuming they don&#39;t go out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">business which we hope they won&#39;t do to</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:19.680" style="s2">covet</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">um but i guess part of the question here</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.680" end="00:40:23.040" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">you know it it has become a kind of is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:28.880" style="s2">becoming a kind of compelled speech</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">right and um really</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.880" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i&#39;ll just go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">answer the question that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">ask here i don&#39;t think it should be</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">incumbent upon anyone</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">who is trying to create a piece of safe</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">fiction that takes place</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">in an era in which you know there</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">weren&#39;t a diversity of particular races</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">to introduce them right right for i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">for one thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">among among many other problems doing so</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">requires learning about a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">other things such that you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">fictionalizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">people and races in a way that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.720" style="s2">much more likely to caricature</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">and actually make racial missteps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.720" end="00:41:03.839" style="s2">right so it certainly should not be</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.839" end="00:41:08.800" style="s2">i we have both seen it done well</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">um and it does seem to be becoming</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.800" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">compelled and so that would that itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:15.119" style="s2">would cause me to push back against it</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">um but but having seen many plays that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.119" end="00:41:18.079" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">i will say that it can be done well and</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.079" end="00:41:21.200" style="s2">it and it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.960" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">you know you know shakespeare can be</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.200" end="00:41:24.160" style="s2">more inclusive than it</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">than the actual lives that he was</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">writing about that were</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">um and that is not inherently a bad</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">thing but um</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">you know the direct question should</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.520" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">games ignore historical truth for more</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">i guess the answer is games could choose</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">to do that if they choose to but step</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">carefully and know they absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">should not be expected to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">that said the mob is loud and growing</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:48.960" style="s2">and we need to push back against the mob</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.960" end="00:41:52.720" style="s2">um what you need is the choice to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">on your own if you&#39;re the creator</p>

<p begin="00:43:06.160" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">really a microaggression or whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.520" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">you&#39;re reading something into it</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">that isn&#39;t there and so all of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">have to be this way we all get little</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">things that feel like slights that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t really and sometimes they</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">are and if you dwell on that stuff</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">but allowing them to get hurt sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.599" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">such that they have learned</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">from what they did and are less likely</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">to make those kinds of decisions going</p>

<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">means that they are far less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:50.079" style="s2">grow up and become the kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">cartoon character</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.079" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">like wiley coyote who uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:57.280" style="s2">so doesn&#39;t believe in gravity it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">actually fall until he looks down</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.280" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">right you know this is the the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:03.440" style="s2">view that imagines that wiley coyote is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">scooting off a cliff and not falling</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.440" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">until he knows that he should fall</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.040" style="s2">is the kind of mischaracterization of</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">physics that we are we are raising in</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.040" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">kids and</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:12.599" style="s2">you know to to those who would say what</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">are you talking about physics isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.599" end="00:44:15.040" style="s2">socio-emotional learning well it is like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.040" end="00:44:18.240" style="s2">that&#39;s how you get it because expose</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.240" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">in groups and alone to the physical</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">universe and then allow</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">them to start seeding those ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">those things that they&#39;ve learned into</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">their friend groups</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:29.040" style="s2">and among their siblings and they will</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">figure out uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.040" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">very quickly what&#39;s true in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s not what&#39;s right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:36.319" style="s2">not what&#39;s just what&#39;s kind what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:38.880" style="s2">generous and what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.319" end="00:44:40.319" style="s2">so many of these things there is some</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.880" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">line to be drawn somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:45.599" style="s2">like with bullying right bullying sucks</p>

<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:58.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to defend it okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s useful in the way we</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.240" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">see it and i find it jarring exactly as</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">you know when people are described as if</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what they were yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">are bodies that&#39;s a misuse but i think</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">originally it comes from ton of hazy</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">coats</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">and that his point which i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:15.520" style="s2">is that ultimately oppression comes down</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.520" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">the control of somebody&#39;s body right</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of stuff that happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">in the space of what is said and what is</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">believed but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:28.400" style="s2">this is about things in the physical</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">universe it&#39;s about the body&#39;s access to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.400" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">resources the body&#39;s ability to be free</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:37.119" style="s2">and that may not be perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">accurate but i find it insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.119" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">what&#39;s troubling is just with you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">there&#39;s some kernel at the bottom of it</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:48.880" style="s2">that&#39;s important that then gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">drawn into this ideology that makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.880" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">that turns it into nonsense and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">more pernicious nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">so the idea of describing people as if</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:58.720" style="s2">they were simply bodies</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.480" style="s2">is obviously absurd and it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">dehumanizing exactly as you say</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.480" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">but the idea of tracking the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">in which somebody&#39;s body is being</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">controlled by some</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">unethical force is important and so i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">would you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">there are a lot of these things i would</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">like to rescue the important thing from</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">the bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">you know woke used to be an honorable</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">meaningful term it&#39;s now a garbage term</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">but it&#39;d be lovely to be able to recover</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">the original thing because it actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">mattered</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">yeah very good first question</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:35.359" style="s2">from this super chat q a super chat</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:36.800" style="s2">is anyone tracking what medications were</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.359" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">administered</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:40.079" style="s2">sorry is anyone tracking what</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:42.160" style="s2">medications were administered to people</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.079" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">who have lingering symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.160" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">that is such a good question and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">know i&#39;ve not seen anything on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:49.280" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">well i can tell you we do a terrible job</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.280" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">of this about</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">everything right so there we are running</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">an experiment we are the lab rats</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.359" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">in some giant experiment where we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">having drugs administered to us that</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">nobody could possibly know what their</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">long-term effects</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">are and the problem is if you just think</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">through the logic</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">of let&#39;s say um</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">i mean in this case we know that</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">that erythromycin does heart damage but</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:20.160" style="s2">very late emerging that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">information your doctor probably still</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.160" end="00:49:24.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">yeah the point is you had lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.160" end="00:49:27.359" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.720" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">administered erythromycin it works it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.359" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">a very functional antibiotic</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:33.440" style="s2">what would have to happen you go on it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">you get rid of your infection</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.440" end="00:49:37.119" style="s2">and you go off it how much damage does</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">it have to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.119" end="00:49:40.240" style="s2">before somebody puts together the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">pattern oh that person was on</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.240" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">erythromycin 25 years ago and now they</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:45.680" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">you know a heart problem yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.680" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no way unless you&#39;re tracking</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">what should be happening and this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">increasingly beginning to happen in some</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:56.400" style="s2">is you have to track everything that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">some population takes so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.400" end="00:49:59.359" style="s2">then go back and look at the data and</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">say all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.359" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">did the people who took erythromycin in</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">their 20s have any reduced</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">longevity right so i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">huge obviously and we should be doing we</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">we should be doing this and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.319" style="s2">difficult to do yeah in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">one way at least the coveted problem is</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.319" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">more sa is more solvable like it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">tractable because the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:21.839" style="s2">the time period is so much shorter right</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.839" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">so yeah i mean it does what</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.839" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">one thing you didn&#39;t say that adds</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">complexity of course is that all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.240" style="s2">supplements and over-the-counter things</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">that people are taking that may be</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.240" end="00:50:32.079" style="s2">interacting badly with diseases or other</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:32.640" style="s2">medications um we aren&#39;t tracking</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.079" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.640" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">we just don&#39;t even we just don&#39;t even we</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">pretend we don&#39;t even care and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:38.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">but this is you know if we go back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.400" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">one of the discussions we had at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">beginning of our series of live streams</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:46.480" style="s2">here we argued</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">that military bases for example</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.480" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">constitute</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">populations that you could track over</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">time and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">you should get hazard pay</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.319" style="s2">or something you should get paid for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.079" style="s2">keeping track of all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.319" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">including the supplements that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.079" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">used on your own yeah you should</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">definitely you need to get something for</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">giving up</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">this level of privacy for some period of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">time right like you know we&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">for for some authority some research</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">authority which presumably has some</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">presence in it to be able to look into</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">your medicine cabinet and everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">that you&#39;re putting in your mouth that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:21.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a very big breach of privacy</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">but um you know many people would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.920" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">willing to do that for a period of time</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">uh and you know especially if it came</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">with right and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">it could be anonymized you know we could</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">we could address the privacy concerns so</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:34.480" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">there was some method of authentication</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.480" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">in which the data went in and according</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.160" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">to some number that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">nobody could track yeah um but what we</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">need to do is we need to re we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">denoise the data</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">so that it&#39;s not up to physicians to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">detect some pattern months or years down</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">the road</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">to ask exactly the right question of of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">the patient and have the patient know</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.880" style="s2">exactly what to say at the right time</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.559" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">right and the answer is so much</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.880" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">eetrogenic</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">harm that is to say medically caused</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:03.920" style="s2">harm is the result</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">of the fact that our data is too noisy</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.920" end="00:52:07.359" style="s2">for us to be able to track</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:08.319" style="s2">even really important patterns like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.359" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">that drug you took</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:11.359" style="s2">uh you know caused your achilles tendon</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.359" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">fragile and to break or knocked ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:17.200" style="s2">years off your life</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">or any of these things you can&#39;t notice</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.200" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">that in a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.680" style="s2">setting you have to get it from a large</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">enough sample in which you&#39;ve collected</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.680" end="00:52:25.839" style="s2">really good data on what people took</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">and you have no idea how much time</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.839" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">you&#39;re doing to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:31.839" style="s2">yeah next question</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">in order to learn the lesson about</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.839" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">authoritarianism would it be would it</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">help to illegalize intellectual bullying</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">of the kind that is happening now</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting that question came in</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:44.559" style="s2">before we talked about bullying right</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.720" end="00:52:45.839" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s this one i&#39;ll read it again</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.559" end="00:52:47.440" style="s2">in order to learn the lesson about</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:49.599" style="s2">authoritarianism would it help to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.440" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">illegalize intellectual bullying of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.599" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">kind that is happening now</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:59.359" style="s2">i think illegalizing bullying</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.880" style="s2">has the problem that we see across</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:02.640" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">with regard to you know what point at</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.640" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">what point are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:08.079" style="s2">stepping in uh appropriately and at what</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">point is it inappropriate when is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.079" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">censorship when is it not when is it</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">bullying when is it not</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:16.800" style="s2">uh so you know like like you said to</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:18.640" style="s2">speaking to bullying just a few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.800" end="00:53:19.599" style="s2">ago like i said before this question</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.640" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">came in</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.599" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">um or rather no this question was asked</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">before you spoke to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">um bullying is real</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a real hazard to it but the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">that our school yards have responded to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:37.119" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">um is ridiculous and um antithetical</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.119" end="00:53:40.079" style="s2">actually to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">creating robust and anti-fragile</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.079" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">children</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:44.400" style="s2">yeah i would i would suspect that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">same would be true over an intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.400" end="00:53:47.839" style="s2">bullying space</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">i would agree completely yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.839" end="00:53:53.119" style="s2">think illegalizing it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">backfire yeah two-part question</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.119" end="00:53:57.440" style="s2">one what does reaching out to potential</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">dark horse candidates look like</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.440" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">two are grad students in a unique</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">position to handle this great awokening</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:06.559" style="s2">i am a graduate physics student go</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">stem so first question what is reaching</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.559" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">out to potential directors candidates</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">well there&#39;s a reason we phrased this as</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">a draft and i think the basic</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">problem is that we have a national</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">emergency</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">and we are seeking candidates who are</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">patriotic courageous and capable and we</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">believe that in the end such</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">people are very likely to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">that we need them and that as much as</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:33.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to do the job and i</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">think a great many people</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">who might be identified by this process</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">will not want the job the smart ones</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:44.960" style="s2">they won&#39;t want it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">um but that&#39;s to say um that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.960" end="00:54:47.680" style="s2">reason for phrasing it as a draft so</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:49.200" style="s2">what does it look like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:50.960" style="s2">we will find that out when we have our</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.200" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">candidates some of them will be easier</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:53.359" style="s2">to reach and some of them will be more</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">difficult to reach</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.359" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">but a patriotic appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">the nation and the world&#39;s well-being</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:04.240" style="s2">and the catastrophe of having</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">two people who are both disinclined</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.240" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">towards leadership and growing too old</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">to to affect it</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">calls upon the rest of us to do things</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:17.040" style="s2">we might not otherwise do</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.760" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">and the second part of the question</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.040" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">which is different</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.440" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">asks if graduate students are in a</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">unique position to handle this great</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:26.559" style="s2">awokening</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">asked by a graduate student in physics</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.559" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">i think they&#39;re in a terrible position</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:33.760" style="s2">in some ways it&#39;s it&#39;s just as hard a</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">position as there is because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.760" end="00:55:36.079" style="s2">still a student</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">you&#39;re still trapped in the university</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.079" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">system and you&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">at the at the whim of the administration</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">the department the faculty</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re teaching of the undergraduates</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">as well you can just you can get it</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">every which way</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">yep i&#39;m afraid on the other hand i i</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">would love to know what</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">what you see is the potential um to</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:00.160" style="s2">the potential upside to being in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">position maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.160" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">um because being a graduate student</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">sucks and</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">the job that you&#39;re supposed to get at</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">the end of it doesn&#39;t exist you have</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:09.760" style="s2">less to lose and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.960" style="s2">can therefore afford to be bolder yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.760" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">maybe although i mean most</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.960" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">yes one thing that&#39;s true uh that may</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">not be</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.359" style="s2">well known outside of being a graduate</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:19.520" style="s2">student in stem</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.359" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">at least this is always what what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.520" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">advice i always gave to</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:23.359" style="s2">to my students when they were thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">about graduate school one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.359" end="00:56:27.359" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:27.839" style="s2">um do not go into graduate school do not</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.359" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">do not</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.839" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">accept any position for which you will</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">end up in more debt at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">that basically graduate school in stem</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">should pay for itself you will end up</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.640" style="s2">with rich you will end up you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">not with very much money at all to live</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.640" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">on but basically because the stem fields</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">are such high demand</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">with regard to graduate students you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">basically very low paid labor</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">to do either research or teaching you</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">should never have</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:54.799" style="s2">any any new debt that comes in whereas</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">graduate school across the board</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.799" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">is money making opportunity over in</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">humanities and social sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">arts for the university i reckon it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">racket it&#39;s a total recommence a bracket</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:04.319" style="s2">in a different way yeah for stem</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">students but</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.319" end="00:57:07.839" style="s2">master students in stem is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">different but basically if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.839" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">if you are accruing debt as a graduate</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">student in stem</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:15.280" style="s2">you should probably find a different</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:17.680" style="s2">program um so</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.280" end="00:57:19.040" style="s2">that said what you are doing is if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.680" end="00:57:20.880" style="s2">don&#39;t end up with a degree you were sort</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.040" end="00:57:22.640" style="s2">of treading water with nothing to put on</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.880" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">your resume or your cv at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.640" end="00:57:25.920" style="s2">but at the very least you shouldn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">up in in a worse financial position than</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.920" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">you were when you started</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">you know whatever undergraduate debt you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">came in with you still have but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">don&#39;t have any new debt</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">in early mammals clitorises tend to</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:41.200" style="s2">tend to be part of the vagina and</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">trigger ovulation</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.200" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">in humans what is the advantage if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">evolving to be outside</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">if the main benefit is to have less</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">ovulations why hasn&#39;t it disappeared</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.960" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">i think that i&#39;m not sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.720" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">second part of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">um the last part of that i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:03.200" style="s2">how it follows if the main benefit is to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">have less ovulations</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.200" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">um why can can you track why that would</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:11.599" style="s2">the guess as to why it has evolved to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.599" end="00:58:16.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not following it and i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">i&#39;m puzzling over the beginning part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.480" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">the question because my guess</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">based on too little information but</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">some is that clitorises and early</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">mammals are not playing the</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">role that they&#39;re playing where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">important which is in a very small</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">number of taxa</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">know that they&#39;re not but i i&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:41.520" style="s2">sure we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">know well in any case i</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">you know this is the second time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:49.119" style="s2">been asked about the external placement</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">which has an interpretation but i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.119" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">actually so this is from echo</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">um you you know very smart very</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">knowledgeable</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">um and and i&#39;m in touch with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">um over email um if you have</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">access to a paper or eight or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">um send them to me so that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:08.880" style="s2">sense of this and and uh yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:10.319" style="s2">becoming an increasingly dominant topic</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.880" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">in our at least q a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.319" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">section we ought to at least get it</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">um what are the roots of circumcision of</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">infant males in the west what are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:23.520" style="s2">evolutionary advantages if any of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">foreskin so okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.520" end="00:59:29.319" style="s2">this is where we finally get cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">i know this discussion and it is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.319" end="00:59:33.280" style="s2">catastrophe</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:35.440" style="s2">yep here&#39;s the key piece of information</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.280" end="00:59:38.079" style="s2">that you need</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.440" end="00:59:39.520" style="s2">i have deployed years ago now on my</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.079" end="00:59:40.880" style="s2">channel something that i used to teach</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">from which was the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.880" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">adaptive test a test to tell whether</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">something should be assumed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:49.200" style="s2">product of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">evolution and it consists of a diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.200" end="00:59:51.760" style="s2">of whether something</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.160" end="00:59:54.160" style="s2">a characteristic a behavior or a</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.760" end="00:59:57.760" style="s2">structure is complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.160" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">whether it has a cost whether that cost</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.760" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">can be reduced</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">and yet it persists over evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">time the logic being</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:06.799" style="s2">if you have such a structure like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">appendix the appendix is a complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.799" end="01:00:10.240" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">that really is independently enough to</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.240" end="01:00:13.280" style="s2">suggest</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.040" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">the role of adaptation in its creation</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.280" end="01:00:17.920" style="s2">but to be conservative</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:19.520" style="s2">it is a structure that can be reduced so</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.920" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">that is to say that the expense that</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">goes into</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.559" style="s2">the appendix can be reduced over time</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">and yet it persists which implies that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">it is paying the cost</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">of it and as we discussed last time in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">the case of the appendix that would also</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">be the risk</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">of having it and therefore the</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">adaptation is of a magnitude that we can</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">approximate even if we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:40.319" style="s2">what the advantage is now the reason i</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:43.440" style="s2">go through that</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.319" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">is that in the case of the foreskin and</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.440" end="01:00:47.119" style="s2">circumcision</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:47.839" style="s2">they both pass the adaptive test which</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.119" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.839" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2">the foreskin was built by adaptation it</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">a value that more than covers the cost</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">of its production</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">the removal of it also has an adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:04.880" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.599" style="s2">the removal of it is something that has</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.880" end="01:01:07.680" style="s2">persisted</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.599" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">over evolutionary time in spite of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.680" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">cost and the risk</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">of it so what that tells us is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a tension here</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">between values and it may be</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">that in some places the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">value of the foreskin outweighs the risk</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">of removal</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:26.240" style="s2">it may be that in other places the</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">reverse is true it may be that in some</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.240" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">cultural contexts the value of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">uh exceeds the cost of removal or vice</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">versa</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">and so that is the kind of answer we are</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:37.839" style="s2">looking for anybody whose answer comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:40.960" style="s2">down to</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.839" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">this is uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.960" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">mutilation and should be halted because</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">it has no</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">value has misunderstood misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">the implication of circumcision</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">being a long-standing practice whether</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.040" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">you know it could be that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">circumcision is a bit like the appendix</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">in the sense that the thing that made it</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">is no longer present in our environment</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:03.920" style="s2">and therefore at this point</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">the value is not there there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.920" end="01:02:10.880" style="s2">lots of debate over the implications</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:12.799" style="s2">for disease so there was a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.880" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">popular piece of research that suggested</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.799" end="01:02:17.200" style="s2">that it was preventative</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:19.440" style="s2">of things like aids</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.200" end="01:02:21.599" style="s2">it may be that hygiene compensates for</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.440" end="01:02:23.520" style="s2">that advantage it may be that that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.599" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">um that data did not indicate what</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.520" end="01:02:26.000" style="s2">people thought it did that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">methodology was no good</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.000" end="01:02:29.119" style="s2">so it is a very complex environment but</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">the thing you want look if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.119" end="01:02:32.319" style="s2">walk away from the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">with something to say on this topic</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.319" end="01:02:37.680" style="s2">that will make you more enlightened</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:39.599" style="s2">than other people it is that both the</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.680" end="01:02:41.760" style="s2">foreskin and its removal</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">are adaptive right that doesn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.760" end="01:02:45.599" style="s2">which context you should expect</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:47.359" style="s2">preservation versus removal but it does</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.599" end="01:02:49.200" style="s2">tell you you&#39;re looking for something at</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.359" end="01:02:49.760" style="s2">least complicated enough to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.200" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.760" end="01:02:52.480" style="s2">set of truths</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">beautiful uh we&#39;re probably at about an</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.640" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">hour zach</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">okay um there are a couple of big uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">money questions here</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.000" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">so we are going to try to get through</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:08.480" style="s2">four more here and i&#39;ve saved one that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:11.200" style="s2">we are going to save</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">uh for the top of next time so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.200" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">through four more questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">uh today could joe rogan</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:19.920" style="s2">and or dave chappelle be the wealthy and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">patriotic citizens that eric called for</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.920" end="01:03:24.960" style="s2">during the campfire</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:27.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got joe&#39;s phone number right um</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.960" end="01:03:29.839" style="s2">well so first of all i have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.520" end="01:03:30.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a squirrel in distress outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.839" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.160" end="01:03:33.520" style="s2">her cats are all inside so okay i think</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:34.880" style="s2">it can fend for itself dealing with its</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.520" end="01:03:37.920" style="s2">own distress</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">um here&#39;s the thing first of all joe is</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.920" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">a friend</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to put joe in any position</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">uh that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:49.760" style="s2">isn&#39;t warranted so the question is</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:51.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this is a monetary issue i</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.760" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">think the thing is joe</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.200" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">is in a unique position in society at</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">he is somebody who has proven the</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:03:59.599" style="s2">ability to acquire a gigantic audience</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">to cover</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">a range of different topics including</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:05.520" style="s2">very controversial stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:06.079" style="s2">to live to tell the tale so far at least</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.520" end="01:04:09.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.079" end="01:04:10.079" style="s2">the question is you know does one want</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.039" end="01:04:13.520" style="s2">to call up joe</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.079" end="01:04:16.960" style="s2">and have him put himself in some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.520" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">jeopardy over something that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.960" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">for joe to answer whether this is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">something because certainly the risk</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:25.359" style="s2">of not having joe playing the role that</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:27.119" style="s2">he is playing and</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.359" end="01:04:28.400" style="s2">his ability to assess what his risks are</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.119" end="01:04:29.680" style="s2">is much greater than our ability to</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.400" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">assess them</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.680" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">that&#39;s not it&#39;s not something anybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">else can answer so</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:37.920" style="s2">i think eric&#39;s uh invitation to whoever</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:40.720" style="s2">it might be</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.920" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">is really a question for somebody to</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.720" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.520" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">whether they are in a position to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:48.880" style="s2">able to play that role and whether they</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:50.799" style="s2">uh the desire to play that role</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.880" end="01:04:52.559" style="s2">has a cost that isn&#39;t worth paying</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">somewhere else can&#39;t answer it for</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.559" end="01:04:56.400" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">yeah okay the next question is about</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.400" end="01:04:59.920" style="s2">consciousness and big brains</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:02.079" style="s2">in homo sapiens and i think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.920" end="01:05:02.799" style="s2">save this for next time but also we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.079" end="01:05:06.000" style="s2">point to</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.799" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">um our princeton talk which</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.039" style="s2">uh which spoke to the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.039" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">in in humans but we will we will address</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">this at the top i would just say</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">i like big brains i cannot lie no</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.760" end="01:05:22.559" style="s2">in peru in peru it has been ruled that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">subjective gender identity is going to</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.559" end="01:05:25.680" style="s2">be what determines what is written in</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">your national id</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.680" end="01:05:29.359" style="s2">this obliterates any relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:31.039" style="s2">objective reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.359" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">why not have different categories for</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.039" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">different levels of sex and gender</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s really unfortunate i have no</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">knowledge of this i&#39;m assuming that the</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">person writing the question does um but</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:44.160" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:46.400" style="s2">you know yes why every time we are</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.160" end="01:05:47.200" style="s2">every time that we are asked what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.400" end="01:05:51.039" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.200" end="01:05:53.680" style="s2">and they give us 87 options or something</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:55.200" style="s2">if they&#39;re going to spend the time to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.680" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">that then they should have given us two</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.200" end="01:05:58.720" style="s2">different questions</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:05:59.520" style="s2">what&#39;s your sex and what&#39;s your gender</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.720" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.520" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">and for those people who think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">important to care about gender identity</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">and there are contexts in which it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">quite important for many people that</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.640" end="01:06:10.559" style="s2">will still give them the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">describe what they view as as their</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.559" end="01:06:15.400" style="s2">gender identity</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">but their actual sex which has</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.400" end="01:06:19.280" style="s2">ramifications</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.319" style="s2">across the board including for their own</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:23.359" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:24.480" style="s2">uh would not be diminished or made</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.359" end="01:06:27.280" style="s2">invisible by</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.480" end="01:06:29.039" style="s2">uh whatever particular possible fantasy</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.280" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">space they&#39;re living in at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.039" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">so i would just link this up with</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:35.920" style="s2">something we&#39;ve said about</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:36.640" style="s2">utopians in general that utopians tend</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.920" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">to be people</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.640" end="01:06:41.359" style="s2">who a are too convinced that they know</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:42.559" style="s2">how to blueprint the solution to some</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.359" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">problem and that b</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.559" end="01:06:46.400" style="s2">tend to be focused on solving one</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">problem and completely unaware of what</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.400" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">the unintended consequences of what they</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:50.640" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">will be and i would just say that this</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.640" end="01:06:54.240" style="s2">is sexual utopianism</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">where there&#39;s one thing that is being</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.240" end="01:07:00.319" style="s2">targeted here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:07:02.880" style="s2">the comfort of people who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.319" end="01:07:03.359" style="s2">having some different gender experience</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">normal right and the idea is we cannot</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s annoying it&#39;s annoying granted</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:44.960" style="s2">it may even literally be driving you</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.960" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">crazy but the engines have to remain</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.960" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">on you know until we get to the ground</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">and then we can talk about whether you</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">could take the train but</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">you know please please do if if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">going to be your complaint please take</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">the train which also isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">quiet</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be that quiet but you</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.120" end="01:09:02.480" style="s2">know not in the u.s you can&#39;t crash</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.600" end="01:09:04.880" style="s2">civilization</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.480" end="01:09:07.120" style="s2">over issues of comfort no matter how</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.880" end="01:09:10.159" style="s2">real they may be yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:12.080" style="s2">okay uh two last questions um</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.159" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">just that came in at high high money</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.080" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">value so um</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we can actually answer</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">this one but i wanted to read it</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:20.159" style="s2">have you read the revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">phenotype before i finish the question i</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.159" end="01:09:23.600" style="s2">will say i have not i don&#39;t even know it</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">i have not it&#39;s ringing a bell it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.600" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">my list somewhere after it was released</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:29.199" style="s2">the field of origin of life and early</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">evolution went silent they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.199" end="01:09:32.319" style="s2">debunk it because it is true but also</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:34.239" style="s2">can&#39;t acknowledge it because the writer</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.319" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">is an outsider</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.239" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know this book is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">an evolution space is that the idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">i guess so yeah so i uh like i say i</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:45.839" style="s2">don&#39;t know it i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:47.679" style="s2">try to make time to look at it um enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2">to know if it&#39;s easy to say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:50.880" style="s2">actually this is where it&#39;s wrong or</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:53.279" style="s2">actually this is one of these things</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.880" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">that um that deserves</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.279" end="01:09:57.280" style="s2">deserves discussion and perhaps the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:59.120" style="s2">person writing the question is right</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.280" end="01:10:01.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not discussed because the writer</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.120" end="01:10:02.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t already in the fold</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.040" end="01:10:06.080" style="s2">but i don&#39;t neither of us know at this</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.880" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">point so final question for today</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.080" end="01:10:10.080" style="s2">neurological or conscious mutation</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.199" end="01:10:13.920" style="s2">sorry i&#39;m just it&#39;s not they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">quite enough words here i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:18.960" style="s2">see how to read it</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:19.360" style="s2">consciousness mutation i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.960" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.360" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">read it i&#39;m not sure it quite makes</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.120" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">sense neurological or consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:26.640" style="s2">mutation for what we are seeing and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:28.719" style="s2">reason they do not make sense to anyone</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.640" end="01:10:30.719" style="s2">outside their circle</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">are these few evolving to be hyper</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.719" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">tolerant outsider intolerant to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">point of superiority or destruction</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.560" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.760" end="01:10:46.640" style="s2">um let&#39;s i&#39;m let&#39;s maybe try to come</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.520" end="01:10:47.520" style="s2">back to that one see if we can make</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.640" end="01:10:49.679" style="s2">sense of it</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.520" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">next time because i i wanted to get to</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.679" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">but i just i the words it&#39;s too dense</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">and there aren&#39;t quite enough connecting</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:56.320" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">so because i said i would do one more</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.320" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna we&#39;re gonna go to this one</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">hey bretton heather are you familiar</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:02.880" style="s2">with ian mcgilchrist the master in his</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.920" end="01:11:04.080" style="s2">emissary</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.880" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">would love to hear your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.080" end="01:11:06.640" style="s2">evolutionary reasons for having two</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.440" end="01:11:08.800" style="s2">brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">do you agree with mcgillcrist thank you</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.800" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">so this this</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:12.880" style="s2">i didn&#39;t read all of it it&#39;s very long</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a very long book</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.880" end="01:11:17.199" style="s2">but he&#39;s great and it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.520" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">interesting and important book we were</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.199" end="01:11:23.040" style="s2">on stage with him</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:25.199" style="s2">yeah 14 months ago or so in may of 2019</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.040" end="01:11:26.560" style="s2">along with our friend jordan hall at the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:29.920" style="s2">rebel wisdom summit</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">in london um</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.920" end="01:11:34.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t agree with him on everything</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">but i am trying to remember exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.480" end="01:11:38.320" style="s2">his position</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:40.239" style="s2">on the brain hemispheres are i did i did</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.320" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">speak to him a little bit one-on-one</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.239" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">backstage about brain hemispheres</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:47.679" style="s2">because so um</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:49.440" style="s2">lateralization which is having um not</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.679" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">we are bilaterally symmetrical and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.440" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">have been since we were early</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:54.239" style="s2">vertebrates</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:56.400" style="s2">um never never have gone into radial</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.239" end="01:11:59.840" style="s2">symmetry since then</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.400" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">or so um but having two halves that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.840" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">roughly mirror images of one another</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">across the left right axis</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:06.560" style="s2">um does not mean that those two halves</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">inherently do different things</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.560" end="01:12:09.600" style="s2">and so at the point that we start</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:11.120" style="s2">talking about brain lateralization is</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.600" end="01:12:12.480" style="s2">the point at which we can see that</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.120" end="01:12:14.080" style="s2">actually the two brain halves the left</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.480" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">and the right are doing different things</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.080" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">and then stemming from that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:18.480" style="s2">downstream effects of that including</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:19.760" style="s2">include things like having handedness</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.480" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2">and footedness and earedness and</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.760" end="01:12:22.400" style="s2">eyedness</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:24.080" style="s2">and so lateralization where you actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">have different stuff happening</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.080" end="01:12:28.000" style="s2">in the left half of your brain and your</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">right half of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.000" end="01:12:32.960" style="s2">begins to um show up pretty early in</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:36.000" style="s2">vertebrate history but really</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.960" end="01:12:37.920" style="s2">really becomes manifest in both</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.000" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">birds and mammals separately that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.920" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">convergent evolution</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">in in two of them because it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">brain parts actually that become the</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">large brains in birds and mammals</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:48.880" style="s2">uh and let&#39;s see just one more thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.400" style="s2">about the history here that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.880" end="01:12:53.679" style="s2">get to</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">and i&#39;ve now forgotten what it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.679" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">um with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2">maybe you want to riff a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:01.920" style="s2">one other thing i want to say about</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:04.400" style="s2">lateralization but i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.920" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">it&#39;ll come back to you yeah uh so i</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.400" end="01:13:07.679" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">i&#39;m a bit familiar with the gilchrist</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.679" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">model</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:13.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a great rsa animate that he uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:15.440" style="s2">narrated which covers it pretty</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.520" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">succinctly in a short period of time</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.440" end="01:13:18.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s been a while since i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">so i&#39;ve now forgotten what his</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.480" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">um his two components were doing</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">i&#39;m seeing the animation in my mind but</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:27.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t have it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">but i thought it was very high quality</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.120" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">and that it dealt with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">issues of the standard right</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:34.960" style="s2">left brain dichotomy garbage that</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:38.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t add up most of it&#39;s garbage yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.960" end="01:13:40.719" style="s2">right and so anyway as far as i&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:42.880" style="s2">mcgill chris and i at least have only</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.719" end="01:13:43.760" style="s2">one important disagreement we might have</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.880" end="01:13:45.840" style="s2">a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.760" end="01:13:47.760" style="s2">sense of certain things but i&#39;ve found</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.840" end="01:13:49.600" style="s2">him very compelling on this topic</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.760" end="01:13:51.440" style="s2">the place where we part company is</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.600" end="01:13:53.679" style="s2">pansysm where he</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.440" end="01:13:55.280" style="s2">does seem to believe that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.679" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">consciousness written into the</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.280" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">matter of the universe and i find this</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:00.640" style="s2">preposterous</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">i will say though it was the marvelous</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.640" end="01:14:03.679" style="s2">case we disagreed with this in pers</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">about this in person</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.679" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">it had no implication for our sense that</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:09.040" style="s2">we were talking to a kindred spirit it</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:12.000" style="s2">was very</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.040" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">uh very rewarding interaction and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.000" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:16.400" style="s2">great demonstration that you can degree</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:17.520" style="s2">or disagree over something absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.400" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.520" end="01:14:20.239" style="s2">and then you know where that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:21.360" style="s2">disagreement no longer has any</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.239" end="01:14:24.000" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.360" end="01:14:25.520" style="s2">and everything else um is just simply</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.000" end="01:14:27.040" style="s2">enlightening and productive</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.520" end="01:14:29.040" style="s2">and you know it was exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.040" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">experience yeah now he is he is</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.040" end="01:14:32.960" style="s2">fabulous he&#39;s he&#39;s really uh an amazing</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:35.600" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.960" end="01:14:37.520" style="s2">kindred spirit like you said um so i was</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">trying to sort of riff and bide time to</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.520" end="01:14:40.800" style="s2">see if i could prompt myself to remember</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">exactly what his position</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.800" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">on lateralization in the brain is and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:44.719" style="s2">just don&#39;t remember it so i will speak</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.719" end="01:14:47.840" style="s2">what you know what i have said before um</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:49.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.840" end="01:14:51.520" style="s2">what i have thought before with regard</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.280" end="01:14:53.199" style="s2">to um you know why why two brain</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.520" end="01:14:54.880" style="s2">well two brain hemispheres is is</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.199" end="01:14:57.120" style="s2">something we have inherited from</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.880" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">our mammalian ancestors from way back</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.120" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">even before there appears to be distinct</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">functioning between them</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:05.199" style="s2">as soon as you have two distinct brain</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:07.360" style="s2">hemispheres the cerebral cortex you also</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.199" end="01:15:08.880" style="s2">have the evolution of what in mammals is</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.360" end="01:15:11.199" style="s2">called the corpus callosum</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.880" end="01:15:12.480" style="s2">which is a neurological band of fibers</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.199" end="01:15:14.480" style="s2">that connects the two</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.480" end="01:15:16.080" style="s2">so this raises the question of course if</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.480" end="01:15:17.920" style="s2">you are going to separate</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.080" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">your two main parts of your braid that</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.920" end="01:15:20.320" style="s2">are doing sort of thinking into the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">future and thinking in the back you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.320" end="01:15:23.760" style="s2">scenario building and memory</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:25.199" style="s2">uh and you know and planning and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.760" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">reflection and all of these things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:29.360" style="s2">are cerebral cortex is so excellent at</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.440" end="01:15:30.320" style="s2">um why if you&#39;re going to separate it</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.360" end="01:15:31.120" style="s2">are you then going to bring them back</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.320" end="01:15:33.920" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.120" end="01:15:34.320" style="s2">well there&#39;s real benefit in being able</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.920" end="01:15:36.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.320" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">hide some things from yourself over here</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.320" end="01:15:40.000" style="s2">or to specialize and localize a task</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:41.120" style="s2">over here while</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.000" end="01:15:44.080" style="s2">the other part of your brain is doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.120" end="01:15:48.320" style="s2">something else over here and</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.080" end="01:15:51.040" style="s2">in fact we we see predictable</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.320" end="01:15:52.560" style="s2">differences in the size of the corpus</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.040" end="01:15:53.520" style="s2">callosum that connects the two</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.560" end="01:15:56.560" style="s2">hemispheres</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.520" end="01:15:57.840" style="s2">based on some demographic markers and</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.560" end="01:15:59.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve raised this before and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.840" end="01:16:01.040" style="s2">actually i have not gone back and looked</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.600" end="01:16:02.400" style="s2">to see that this has</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.040" end="01:16:04.239" style="s2">stood the test of time but what i used</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.400" end="01:16:05.679" style="s2">to say to my students when this would</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:07.840" style="s2">come up in class</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.679" end="01:16:09.040" style="s2">which again i&#39;m not positive is totally</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.840" end="01:16:11.920" style="s2">up to date</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.040" end="01:16:12.960" style="s2">was that on average women and</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.920" end="01:16:14.960" style="s2">left-handers</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.960" end="01:16:17.280" style="s2">and homosexuals have larger corpus</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.960" end="01:16:19.360" style="s2">callosums than do men or right-handers</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.280" end="01:16:23.199" style="s2">or heterosexual people</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.360" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">and um if you just think in terms of ah</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.199" end="01:16:26.960" style="s2">this thing that we&#39;ve got is good</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">therefore i want a bigger one</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.960" end="01:16:30.560" style="s2">you will feel a little bit out of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:32.960" style="s2">loop if you&#39;re a right-handed straight</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.560" end="01:16:34.960" style="s2">male but of course it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.960" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">like you for instance for example for</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:38.800" style="s2">example whereas i get two of them right</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:40.320" style="s2">like i&#39;m i&#39;m a left-handed woman so okay</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.800" end="01:16:41.920" style="s2">my corpus callosum</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.320" end="01:16:43.360" style="s2">on average is likely to be you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.920" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">tell until i&#39;m dead so don&#39;t try to</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.360" end="01:16:46.800" style="s2">check</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">um um we could scan yes you could</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.800" end="01:16:50.080" style="s2">probably scan but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">um on average larger than someone who</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.080" end="01:16:52.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t have either of those demographic</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">markers but</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.239" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">so what like what is it better for so</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">what does a more integrated left and</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:01.360" style="s2">right brain</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:03.280" style="s2">bring you perhaps a greater um maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.360" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">greater executive function which is this</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.280" end="01:17:06.000" style="s2">i i don&#39;t love the term executive</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:09.120" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.000" end="01:17:10.640" style="s2">but um i think that there is separate</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.120" end="01:17:11.920" style="s2">psychological neurological evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.640" end="01:17:13.920" style="s2">women on average have better</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:15.199" style="s2">executive function than men it has to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.920" end="01:17:18.000" style="s2">with sort of organizing</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.199" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">things and spaces and keeping track of</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.000" end="01:17:22.960" style="s2">calendars and things like this</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:25.280" style="s2">right and that that might well be</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.960" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">a result of a more integrated brain in</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.280" end="01:17:27.920" style="s2">which it is also harder to hide things</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:29.679" style="s2">from yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.920" end="01:17:32.080" style="s2">so the flip side of that why would you</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.679" end="01:17:34.960" style="s2">maybe want a brain that has</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.080" end="01:17:36.320" style="s2">less frequent or able connection between</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.960" end="01:17:38.560" style="s2">the two hemispheres maybe you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.320" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">partition and specialize and go deep and</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.560" end="01:17:43.440" style="s2">block out the rest of the world to the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:46.239" style="s2">enduring irritation of those around you</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.440" end="01:17:48.800" style="s2">was that personal and and you know and</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.239" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">and really dive deep more effectively</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.800" end="01:17:52.239" style="s2">um than if you had a bigger copper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">closer you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.239" end="01:17:55.520" style="s2">that&#39;s hypothesis i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s true but can you imagine</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.520" end="01:17:59.600" style="s2">a trade-off between having a more</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">integrated versus more separate</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.600" end="01:18:02.719" style="s2">separate brain of course you can and is</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:04.800" style="s2">one better</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.719" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">no one&#39;s better in some circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.800" end="01:18:07.760" style="s2">for some tasks and the other is better</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:08.800" style="s2">in some other circumstances for some</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.760" end="01:18:11.360" style="s2">kinds of tasks</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.800" end="01:18:12.960" style="s2">so in closing i would just say we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.360" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">a number of different models one</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.960" end="01:18:16.560" style="s2">the the typical one uh that we hear left</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.600" end="01:18:19.120" style="s2">right brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.560" end="01:18:20.000" style="s2">you know analytical artistic yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.120" end="01:18:22.320" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.000" end="01:18:23.360" style="s2">um the mastering this emissary version</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.320" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">is really cool</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.360" end="01:18:28.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a another like a bicameral brain</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:30.960" style="s2">model that i think has a lot of merit to</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.719" end="01:18:32.320" style="s2">it i&#39;ve deployed one which i will</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.960" end="01:18:35.679" style="s2">explore more fully</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:37.679" style="s2">uh at some place that has to do with um</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.679" end="01:18:39.120" style="s2">an interaction between consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.679" end="01:18:42.560" style="s2">unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.120" end="01:18:43.760" style="s2">uh but anyway there is there is a theme</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.560" end="01:18:46.480" style="s2">to be explored</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.760" end="01:18:47.440" style="s2">and the early simple diagnoses turn out</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.480" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">to be wrong</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.440" end="01:18:50.800" style="s2">there is a trade-off based on</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:53.840" style="s2">connectivity versus</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.800" end="01:18:55.679" style="s2">uh separability there that&#39;s evident in</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.840" end="01:18:57.440" style="s2">the structural differences</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.679" end="01:18:58.960" style="s2">and anyway it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.440" end="01:19:01.679" style="s2">important um</p>
