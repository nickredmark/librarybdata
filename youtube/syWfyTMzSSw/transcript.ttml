<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:25.060" style="s2">thank you everyone and it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.689" end="00:00:27.940" style="s2">great pleasure to be here this is such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.060" end="00:00:29.980" style="s2">fun conference it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.980" end="00:00:34.570" style="s2">academically interesting but I find it</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.500" end="00:00:37.390" style="s2">the most playful conference I get to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.570" end="00:00:40.420" style="s2">attend there&#39;s a lot more engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.390" end="00:00:43.239" style="s2">interest and exploration so it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.420" end="00:00:44.860" style="s2">lot of fun and I need more fun so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.239" end="00:00:46.750" style="s2">good to be here all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.860" end="00:00:48.360" style="s2">so I want to also give credit where</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.750" end="00:00:52.000" style="s2">credit is due</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.360" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna be talking about work a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.000" end="00:00:56.770" style="s2">ideas and a lot of those ideas were done</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:01:00.250" style="s2">in work that I did with Leo Ferraro also</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.770" end="00:01:03.969" style="s2">with Richard Wu and and Anderson Todd</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.250" end="00:01:05.320" style="s2">who of course is here today so what do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.969" end="00:01:07.000" style="s2">want to talk about I want to talk I want</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.320" end="00:01:09.610" style="s2">to try and first start by exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.000" end="00:01:12.070" style="s2">idea of why do you altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.610" end="00:01:15.070" style="s2">consciousness often have so much</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.070" end="00:01:17.890" style="s2">significance and effect associated with</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.070" end="00:01:21.549" style="s2">them and why do we pursue them why do we</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.890" end="00:01:24.430" style="s2">induce them what&#39;s going on there and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.549" end="00:01:26.080" style="s2">think in some sense we find altered</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.430" end="00:01:29.650" style="s2">states of consciousness rewarding and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.080" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">then typically when things are rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.650" end="00:01:35.530" style="s2">for us kind of universally rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:37.720" style="s2">then there must be their natural to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.530" end="00:01:39.100" style="s2">in some way and they are functional in</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.720" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">some way they have some adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.100" end="00:01:43.960" style="s2">function and I want to try and get into</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:45.280" style="s2">the functionality of altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.960" end="00:01:47.049" style="s2">consciousness we tend to talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.280" end="00:01:48.400" style="s2">about the phenomenology and I&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.049" end="00:01:51.549" style="s2">bit about that but I want to get more</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.400" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">into the functionality of them and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.549" end="00:01:56.290" style="s2">order to do that I think we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">start talking about the functionality of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.290" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">consciousness which is like oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:04.509" style="s2">because this is one of the hard problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:06.850" style="s2">like one of the hardest problems in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.509" end="00:02:08.259" style="s2">cognitive science I mean it&#39;s amazing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.850" end="00:02:10.420" style="s2">you a what what would you give up for</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.259" end="00:02:12.489" style="s2">your consciousness if I told you you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.420" end="00:02:15.670" style="s2">have like a billion dollars and all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.489" end="00:02:17.380" style="s2">sexual experiences you want and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:22.130" style="s2">and power you just don&#39;t get to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.380" end="00:02:23.540" style="s2">conscious of it would you take that deal</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.130" end="00:02:29.300" style="s2">but if I ask you what does your</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.540" end="00:02:31.250" style="s2">consciousness do what does it do because</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.300" end="00:02:33.860" style="s2">most of your behavior most of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.250" end="00:02:35.630" style="s2">behavior is being run unconsciously so</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.860" end="00:02:36.890" style="s2">what does your consciousness do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.630" end="00:02:40.100" style="s2">it looks like it&#39;s just hanging around</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.890" end="00:02:42.290" style="s2">waiting for work well what I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.100" end="00:02:45.140" style="s2">and do is talk a little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.290" end="00:02:47.090" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna try and talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.140" end="00:02:48.140" style="s2">function of consciousness and not that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.090" end="00:02:49.520" style="s2">much about the nature of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.140" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">which is called the heart problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.520" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">because it&#39;s hard called the hard</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:56.390" style="s2">problem because it&#39;s hard and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.590" style="s2">think we have time to tackle it and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.390" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">want to concentrate on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.590" end="00:03:01.660" style="s2">current most important theories of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:02.810" style="s2">function of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:05.080" style="s2">neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.810" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">and cognitive scientific and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.080" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">psychological theories of the function</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">of consciousness not because I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:11.750" style="s2">they&#39;re comprehensively right but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.660" style="s2">intrigued by the fact that they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.750" end="00:03:16.520" style="s2">be converging on a consensus as to at</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.660" end="00:03:18.320" style="s2">least one of the central functions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.520" end="00:03:20.360" style="s2">consciousness so the first of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.320" end="00:03:23.570" style="s2">theories of consciousness is called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.360" end="00:03:25.880" style="s2">global work space theory it&#39;s advocated</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.570" end="00:03:27.350" style="s2">by people like bars or shanahan and bars</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.880" end="00:03:30.350" style="s2">and the main idea is that your</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.350" end="00:03:33.460" style="s2">consciousness functions like the desktop</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.350" end="00:03:35.510" style="s2">on your computer most of the files right</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.460" end="00:03:37.310" style="s2">aren&#39;t on your desktop and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.510" end="00:03:38.840" style="s2">corresponds to most of your processing</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.310" end="00:03:40.880" style="s2">is going unconscious going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.840" end="00:03:42.680" style="s2">unconsciously and what happens in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:44.330" style="s2">consciousness is those files are</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.680" end="00:03:46.730" style="s2">accessed like they&#39;re accessed by your</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.330" end="00:03:48.590" style="s2">desktop and you can access files and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.730" end="00:03:51.530" style="s2">hold them together and manipulate them</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.590" end="00:03:54.110" style="s2">and do interesting things with them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.530" end="00:03:56.060" style="s2">this seems to have some overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.110" end="00:03:58.040" style="s2">some psychological work and Bars has</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.060" end="00:04:00.230" style="s2">admitted this that&#39;s done in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.040" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">on working memory working memory is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.230" end="00:04:04.640" style="s2">that aspect of your memory where you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">activate information hold it in mind and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.640" end="00:04:11.209" style="s2">manipulative etc now what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">is what they what functionality borrows</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.209" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">attributes to this and in an article</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:18.859" style="s2">with shanahan and then a later article</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:20.480" style="s2">in the handbook unconsciousness bars and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.859" end="00:04:22.250" style="s2">shanahan and bars argue that the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.480" end="00:04:25.250" style="s2">function of consciousness why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.250" end="00:04:27.110" style="s2">structured this way is to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.250" end="00:04:30.200" style="s2">frame problem or as Shanahan rightly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.110" end="00:04:32.120" style="s2">argues because he is considered to be an</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.200" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">authority on the frame problem the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.120" end="00:04:35.540" style="s2">relevance problem the issue of how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:38.300" style="s2">zero in on</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.540" end="00:04:39.980" style="s2">relevant information and many of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.300" end="00:04:42.890" style="s2">know this is an ongoing obsession of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.980" end="00:04:44.990" style="s2">mine what is it how do we do this how do</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.890" end="00:04:47.030" style="s2">we zero in on relevant information of</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.990" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">all the information available to us in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:51.890" style="s2">the environment all the information</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">available to in our minds how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.890" end="00:04:55.490" style="s2">rapidly and effectively zero in on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:57.560" style="s2">relative relevant information we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.490" end="00:04:59.480" style="s2">make connections in that information</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.560" end="00:05:01.820" style="s2">that we find relevant and then act</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.480" end="00:05:04.310" style="s2">appropriately on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.820" end="00:05:06.350" style="s2">information very very central process</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.310" end="00:05:09.860" style="s2">and I&#39;ll come back to that repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.350" end="00:05:12.260" style="s2">and the main idea is what happens is all</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.860" end="00:05:13.970" style="s2">of these processes that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.260" end="00:05:15.920" style="s2">consciously they all compete for access</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.970" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">to the workspace and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.920" end="00:05:19.910" style="s2">relevance realization occurs I have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">lot of criticisms of that and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.910" end="00:05:25.250" style="s2">going to go into that but what I find</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:27.350" style="s2">intriguing is this idea that with a core</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.250" end="00:05:31.880" style="s2">function of consciousness is relevance</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.350" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">realization now there is a theory that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.880" end="00:05:34.550" style="s2">is more about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.990" end="00:05:37.250" style="s2">consciousness this is the integrated</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.550" end="00:05:40.520" style="s2">information theory of Tononi and others</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.250" end="00:05:42.530" style="s2">and the basic idea here is a system is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.520" end="00:05:44.150" style="s2">conscious the more its information is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.530" end="00:05:47.180" style="s2">integrated and what that means is how</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.150" end="00:05:49.190" style="s2">pieces of information Kylie they Co vary</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.180" end="00:05:52.730" style="s2">with each other it gets very complex and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.190" end="00:05:55.670" style="s2">mathematical but interestingly when toni</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.730" end="00:05:58.520" style="s2">has proposed a test for how you see if a</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.670" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">system is conscious what he proposes is</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.520" end="00:06:02.210" style="s2">it whether or not the systems can make</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.670" style="s2">judgments of relevancy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.210" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">appropriateness he proposes that for</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.670" end="00:06:08.480" style="s2">example what you do if you&#39;re testing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:10.370" style="s2">system for consciousness is you show it</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.480" end="00:06:12.770" style="s2">a picture of a potted plant in front of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.370" end="00:06:14.570" style="s2">a computer or a bicycle in the sky and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.770" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">if the computer can figure out that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.570" end="00:06:18.560" style="s2">information is right that ill relevee</p>

<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:35.749" style="s2">intersecting in that flash of insight so</p>

<p begin="00:12:42.920" end="00:12:46.939" style="s2">consciousness this helps tell us</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:48.920" style="s2">something about what consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.939" end="00:12:50.600" style="s2">doing and I&#39;m borrowing a term here now</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.920" end="00:12:52.550" style="s2">from Ramachandran that links this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.600" end="00:12:54.620" style="s2">phenomenology and the functionality</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.550" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">together what consciousness is doing for</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.620" end="00:12:58.850" style="s2">us it&#39;s is projecting a salience</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.259" style="s2">landscape right what&#39;s happening is</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.850" end="00:13:03.439" style="s2">certain things are standing out for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.259" end="00:13:06.259" style="s2">now as more salient I hope I am right</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.439" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">and other things are right much have</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.259" end="00:13:10.279" style="s2">much less of a salience profile for you</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:11.809" style="s2">like perhaps the walls and the seat</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.279" end="00:13:14.269" style="s2">until I mentioned them of course your</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.809" end="00:13:15.860" style="s2">left toe left big toe is probably not</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.269" end="00:13:17.929" style="s2">very salient to you and now it is of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.860" end="00:13:20.089" style="s2">course right and so your salience</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.929" end="00:13:23.870" style="s2">landscape is constantly being projected</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.089" end="00:13:25.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s constantly shifting and flowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.870" end="00:13:26.929" style="s2">and what&#39;s really intriguing is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.730" end="00:13:29.060" style="s2">relationship within consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.929" end="00:13:30.920" style="s2">between your salience landscape</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.060" end="00:13:33.680" style="s2">and attention because your salience</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.920" end="00:13:36.740" style="s2">landscape draws your attention you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.680" end="00:13:38.810" style="s2">drawn to what&#39;s salient to you your</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.740" end="00:13:40.550" style="s2">attention goes there but at this on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.810" end="00:13:42.770" style="s2">other hand you can direct your attention</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.550" end="00:13:45.800" style="s2">like I just did with your left big toe</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.770" end="00:13:47.900" style="s2">and that alter a alters its salience so</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:50.210" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in consciousness is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.900" end="00:13:52.340" style="s2">salience landscape and attention are in</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.210" end="00:13:54.140" style="s2">this self-organizing relationship where</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.340" end="00:13:56.750" style="s2">the salience landscape is shaping</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.140" end="00:13:59.540" style="s2">attention and attention is shaping the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.750" end="00:14:01.960" style="s2">salience landscape and as I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:04.850" style="s2">that affords both intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.960" end="00:14:06.350" style="s2">insight I think it affords something</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.850" end="00:14:08.930" style="s2">else it&#39;s really important it affords</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.350" end="00:14:10.400" style="s2">perspectival knowing another kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.930" end="00:14:12.110" style="s2">knowing we&#39;re very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.400" end="00:14:15.410" style="s2">propositional knowing propositional</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.110" end="00:14:16.520" style="s2">knowing is that we&#39;ve you know we so</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.410" end="00:14:18.110" style="s2">we&#39;re all the children of descartes</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.520" end="00:14:20.300" style="s2">right and we come to think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.110" end="00:14:21.950" style="s2">the epitome of knowing propositional</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.300" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">knowing is knowing that something is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.950" end="00:14:26.240" style="s2">case knowing that Australia is both a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.280" style="s2">country and a continent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.240" end="00:14:30.140" style="s2">propositional knowing it there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.280" end="00:14:31.910" style="s2">procedural knowing procedural knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.140" end="00:14:33.710" style="s2">knowing how to do something knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.910" end="00:14:35.480" style="s2">to catch a baseball and it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.710" end="00:14:37.220" style="s2">from knowing the facts about a baseball</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.480" end="00:14:39.020" style="s2">the baseball is round and white knowing</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.220" end="00:14:40.820" style="s2">how to catch it is different but in</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.020" end="00:14:42.950" style="s2">addition to that there&#39;s perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.820" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">knowing this is knowing what it is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.950" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">to be someone what it is like to take a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">particular role it&#39;s knowing how to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">the following immerse yourself in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:54.140" style="s2">particular landscape to project that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:56.870" style="s2">salience landscape and immerse yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.140" end="00:15:01.730" style="s2">in it right now I know what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.870" end="00:15:03.560" style="s2">be a speaker at a conference right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.730" end="00:15:05.570" style="s2">notice how you can do this you can do</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.560" end="00:15:09.380" style="s2">all three I can ask you tell me some</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.570" end="00:15:11.060" style="s2">facts about a baseball do you know how</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.380" end="00:15:12.500" style="s2">to catch a baseball but you can do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.060" end="00:15:15.710" style="s2">third thing imagine what it&#39;s like to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.500" end="00:15:17.510" style="s2">a baseball to take the salience</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.710" end="00:15:19.460" style="s2">landscape of a you know of a baseball</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.510" end="00:15:20.900" style="s2">arcing after it&#39;s been hit and come off</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.460" end="00:15:22.970" style="s2">the bat you can do that and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.900" end="00:15:25.100" style="s2">perspectival knowing is really important</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.970" end="00:15:28.070" style="s2">you know propositional knowledge gives</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.100" end="00:15:29.630" style="s2">us rule-following and procedural</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.070" end="00:15:30.200" style="s2">knowledge gives us routines that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.630" end="00:15:32.660" style="s2">follow</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:35.060" style="s2">but perspectival no knowledge gives us</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.660" end="00:15:37.600" style="s2">role following it gives us ha it gives</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.060" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">us our fundamental roles and how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:42.570" style="s2">interact with the world and how we carve</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:46.590" style="s2">out some of our basic cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.570" end="00:15:49.530" style="s2">and agency so what I&#39;m suggesting to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.590" end="00:15:52.070" style="s2">and I do not mean this to be exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.530" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">I do not mean this to be exhaustive but</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.070" end="00:15:57.090" style="s2">consciousness is an active affordance</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.660" style="s2">and that and so I&#39;m gonna abbreviate</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.090" end="00:16:01.800" style="s2">that with the metaphorical term field</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.660" end="00:16:04.680" style="s2">consciousness is an active affordance a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.800" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">field of intelligent insight and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.680" end="00:16:10.290" style="s2">perspective taking and in which that</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.100" end="00:16:12.050" style="s2">intelligence machinery the insight</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.290" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">machinery and the perspective or</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.050" end="00:16:18.680" style="s2">machinery are all mutually supporting</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:21.840" style="s2">and mutually developing together so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.680" end="00:16:24.060" style="s2">given that rather rapid - through the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.840" end="00:16:25.860" style="s2">functionality of consciousness which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.060" end="00:16:27.000" style="s2">like you know I&#39;m gonna explain God to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.860" end="00:16:30.090" style="s2">you in five minutes or something like</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.000" end="00:16:32.160" style="s2">that right well I want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.090" end="00:16:34.980" style="s2">altered states of consciousness the ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.160" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">that David alluded to right and their</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.980" end="00:16:38.670" style="s2">functionality so think about first let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:41.430" style="s2">go back to the flash of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.670" end="00:16:42.660" style="s2">there is something happening there let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.430" end="00:16:44.520" style="s2">let&#39;s think about something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.660" end="00:16:47.100" style="s2">related to that and can be extended oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.520" end="00:16:50.430" style="s2">right and this is the flow experience</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.100" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">talked about by chicks MRI so think</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.430" end="00:16:54.570" style="s2">about the flow experience a typical</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:56.490" style="s2">situation that engenders at rock</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.570" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">climbing you&#39;re trying to climb up a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.490" end="00:17:00.150" style="s2">rock right and you impasse you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:01.620" style="s2">know how to go forward and you really</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.150" end="00:17:03.750" style="s2">have to restructure you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.620" end="00:17:05.790" style="s2">landscape right and it&#39;s perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.750" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">knowing and then you shift and you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.790" end="00:17:10.050" style="s2">to another situation you impasse and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">then you either get it you get another</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.050" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">insight and you break out and then what</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:15.780" style="s2">starts to happen is those insights start</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:18.270" style="s2">to cascade so instead of impasses</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.780" end="00:17:19.350" style="s2">potential impasses are just experiences</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.270" end="00:17:20.820" style="s2">challenges</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.350" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly overcoming in your</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.820" end="00:17:24.030" style="s2">skills and your challenges are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:26.490" style="s2">ratcheting each other like this and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.030" end="00:17:28.830" style="s2">get into the zone right and you and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.490" end="00:17:30.960" style="s2">feel this this paradoxical state in</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.830" end="00:17:32.700" style="s2">which you&#39;re simultaneously exerting a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.960" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">lot of effort and it seems effortless</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.700" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">you seem at one with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:41.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a significant distortion of time</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.700" end="00:17:43.830" style="s2">you lose that nattering Nannie</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">egocentric narrative consciousness you</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.830" end="00:17:46.680" style="s2">know that that thing in your head that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.000" end="00:17:49.680" style="s2">how do I look how am i doing how do I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.680" end="00:17:52.980" style="s2">look how am i doing that goes away that</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.680" end="00:17:54.630" style="s2">goes away right and you feel like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.980" end="00:17:55.110" style="s2">feel resonant with your environment and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.630" end="00:17:57.539" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.110" end="00:17:59.549" style="s2">super salience everything is glowing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.539" end="00:18:01.620" style="s2">vibrant and it&#39;s deeply meaningful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.549" end="00:18:03.360" style="s2">deeply meaningful such that people tend</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.620" end="00:18:05.460" style="s2">to evaluate the goodness of their life</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.360" end="00:18:08.970" style="s2">in terms of how often they flow within</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.460" end="00:18:10.980" style="s2">it but so this is definitely an altered</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.970" end="00:18:14.309" style="s2">state of consciousness it has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.980" end="00:18:15.929" style="s2">features that we find in altered states</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.930" end="00:22:14.370" style="s2">and that that&#39;s why we have to tap into</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.270" end="00:22:17.580" style="s2">the fact that relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.370" end="00:22:19.170" style="s2">inherently self-correcting now if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.070" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">more of an expert than I am on this but</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.440" end="00:25:14.280" style="s2">you know openness is really well</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.860" style="s2">correlated with you know your insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.280" end="00:25:19.410" style="s2">abilities creativity things like that so</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.860" end="00:25:21.000" style="s2">this represents a fundamental change not</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.410" end="00:25:22.770" style="s2">just in personality but in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.000" end="00:25:25.260" style="s2">cognitive agency that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.770" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">to suggest to you this is what altered</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.260" end="00:25:30.630" style="s2">states of consciousness can do for us</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:31.950" style="s2">this is the power they have for us now I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.630" end="00:25:33.930" style="s2">want to talk a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.950" end="00:25:37.110" style="s2">this powerful self transcendence what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.930" end="00:25:39.720" style="s2">going on in it and here I want to turn</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.110" end="00:25:42.780" style="s2">to the work of John Wright and the work</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.720" end="00:25:46.110" style="s2">he&#39;s done based on the really seminal</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.780" end="00:25:48.060" style="s2">work of Iris Murdoch especially in her I</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.110" end="00:25:49.890" style="s2">mean a little gem of a book it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.060" end="00:25:51.810" style="s2">these little books right I&#39;d be coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.890" end="00:25:53.460" style="s2">as I&#39;m getting older I guess death is</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.810" end="00:25:56.030" style="s2">approaching or something I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.460" end="00:25:59.340" style="s2">more and more impressed by little books</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.030" end="00:26:02.670" style="s2">it used to be no you read Hegel and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.340" end="00:26:04.410" style="s2">god right now it&#39;s these little thin</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.670" end="00:26:07.880" style="s2">books that like are like they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.410" end="00:26:10.560" style="s2">these swords that go through right oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.880" end="00:26:12.870" style="s2">right I highly recommend the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.560" end="00:26:14.930" style="s2">of the good to you your life will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.870" end="00:26:19.140" style="s2">more valuable to you if you&#39;ve read it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.930" end="00:26:21.930" style="s2">that was a joke okay now Murdoch does a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.140" end="00:26:24.270" style="s2">lot in there and she talks a lot about a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.930" end="00:26:25.770" style="s2">particular situation and let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.270" end="00:26:28.170" style="s2">go the situation then right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.770" end="00:26:29.400" style="s2">lot of work on it and so Murdoch talks</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.170" end="00:26:30.690" style="s2">about this situation which you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.400" end="00:26:33.750" style="s2">mother-in-law and she has a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.690" end="00:26:35.550" style="s2">daughter-in-law and she thinks of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.750" end="00:26:39.630" style="s2">daughter-in-laws sort of like coarse and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.550" end="00:26:43.560" style="s2">crude and loud so yeah my son married</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.630" end="00:26:46.770" style="s2">beneath himself all right but then one</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.560" end="00:26:48.269" style="s2">day and a spontaneous fashion she has</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.770" end="00:26:50.070" style="s2">this insight</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.269" end="00:26:53.969" style="s2">that you know her daughter really isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.070" end="00:26:57.749" style="s2">course she&#39;s really sort of grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.969" end="00:27:01.109" style="s2">she isn&#39;t crude right she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.749" end="00:27:05.219" style="s2">direct and sincere and she isn&#39;t loud</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.109" end="00:27:07.019" style="s2">she&#39;s boisterous and vivacious so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.219" end="00:27:09.419" style="s2">this restructuring now it was just that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.019" end="00:27:11.879" style="s2">we would call it an insight but Murdoch</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.419" end="00:27:13.739" style="s2">takes it farther she says well what</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.879" end="00:27:15.989" style="s2">happens is the mother doesn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.739" end="00:27:18.659" style="s2">realize something different about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.989" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">daughter-in-law the insight if I can put</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.659" end="00:27:23.479" style="s2">it this way is bi-directional it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:25.769" style="s2">only an insight into the daughter-in-law</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.479" end="00:27:28.499" style="s2">right the mother-in-law has an insight</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.769" end="00:27:30.719" style="s2">into her very competence the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.499" end="00:27:33.089" style="s2">mother-in-law realizes that the way she</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.719" end="00:27:35.339" style="s2">frames all situations needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.089" end="00:27:40.049" style="s2">transforms needs to be called into</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.339" end="00:27:42.149" style="s2">question right see what&#39;s going on all</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.049" end="00:27:44.190" style="s2">the time in perspective annoying is this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.149" end="00:27:46.349" style="s2">by directionality the process of Co</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.190" end="00:27:48.450" style="s2">identification and the Stoics talked a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.349" end="00:27:49.739" style="s2">lot about this and I imagine you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.450" end="00:27:51.690" style="s2">find stuff in the Buddhist that talked a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.739" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">lot about this we&#39;d have to ask Shawn</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.690" end="00:27:54.959" style="s2">because Shawn is the person that will</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:56.249" style="s2">correct any mistakes I make about</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.959" end="00:28:00.659" style="s2">Buddhist psychopath philosophy or</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.249" end="00:28:02.339" style="s2">psychology right but this idea is when</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.659" end="00:28:04.649" style="s2">when when you&#39;re in the salience</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.339" end="00:28:06.629" style="s2">landscape and you&#39;re projecting it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.649" end="00:28:08.820" style="s2">also immersing yourself in it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.629" end="00:28:11.009" style="s2">this binding and projecting process</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.820" end="00:28:12.899" style="s2">right you&#39;re always assigning and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.009" end="00:28:15.029" style="s2">assuming identities that&#39;s what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.899" end="00:28:16.889" style="s2">take a role I&#39;m assigning identities to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.029" end="00:28:19.409" style="s2">you and I&#39;m assuming an identity I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:28:19.409" end="00:28:22.950" style="s2">is a tool that I&#39;m using and I have a</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.269" end="00:28:46.739" style="s2">fundamentally our framing we&#39;re changing</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.459" end="00:28:49.889" style="s2">our existential mode we&#39;re changing how</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.739" end="00:28:53.849" style="s2">we project and right interject how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.889" end="00:28:56.700" style="s2">assign and assumed identities and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.849" end="00:28:59.460" style="s2">whole process that fundamental change in</p>

<p begin="00:29:11.559" end="00:29:17.499" style="s2">you you&#39;re getting object more objective</p>

<p begin="00:29:19.359" end="00:29:23.619" style="s2">happening is that the mother-in-law is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.519" end="00:29:25.960" style="s2">getting is a more virtuous interaction</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.619" end="00:29:28.570" style="s2">with the daughter-in-law a more just</p>

<p begin="00:33:19.620" end="00:33:26.350" style="s2">the very processes that make you so</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:28.299" style="s2">adaptive are the very same ones that</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.489" end="00:33:41.619" style="s2">that also box you in in the nine dot</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.619" end="00:33:43.389" style="s2">problem and altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.619" end="00:33:44.289" style="s2">consciousness bring a greater risk with</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.289" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">I mean in the all in altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.299" end="00:33:54.909" style="s2">consciousness at times you&#39;re uncoupling</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:57.129" style="s2">that salience landscape from the</p>

<p begin="00:33:57.129" end="00:34:00.940" style="s2">back to what I mean by that in a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.389" end="00:34:04.029" style="s2">minutes but what I wanted zero in on is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.940" end="00:34:06.820" style="s2">a very important phenomena that has been</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.029" end="00:34:09.279" style="s2">discussed now famously so by Harry</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.820" end="00:34:13.169" style="s2">Frankfurt I&#39;m sorry I have to use this</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.279" end="00:34:15.399" style="s2">word the essay was entitled on</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.169" end="00:34:16.960" style="s2">and I think this is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.399" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">important philosophical works in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.960" end="00:34:24.659" style="s2">last twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:24.659" style="s2">ok it&#39;s again by the way a little book</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.899" end="00:34:31.839" style="s2">okay so Frankfurt is really interested</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.770" end="00:34:34.270" style="s2">in figuring out what is because</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.839" end="00:34:39.879" style="s2">we seem to be accruing more and more of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.270" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">it and what he does is he distinguishes</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.879" end="00:34:44.559" style="s2">between and bullshitting and</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:46.750" style="s2">lying now I think bullshitting and lying</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.559" end="00:34:48.159" style="s2">are on a continuum and he presents them</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.750" end="00:34:51.669" style="s2">as a little bit more Dakota miss then</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.159" end="00:34:53.349" style="s2">they are but talking about the polls is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.669" end="00:34:55.450" style="s2">a good way of understanding a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.349" end="00:34:57.190" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna I I won&#39;t get into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.450" end="00:35:01.960" style="s2">critique of him there I&#39;ll just follow</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.190" end="00:35:03.760" style="s2">up and what Frankfort argues is that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.960" end="00:35:05.260" style="s2"> artist it&#39;s an interesting term</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.760" end="00:35:07.529" style="s2">a artist</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.260" end="00:35:12.420" style="s2">why is it a carpenter anyways</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.529" end="00:35:14.799" style="s2">ok so right it&#39;s different from the liar</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.420" end="00:35:18.430" style="s2">because the lawyer is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.799" end="00:35:20.619" style="s2">manipulate your behavior by relying on</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.430" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">your commitment to the truth that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.619" end="00:35:24.039" style="s2">fact that the truth can change your</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:26.740" style="s2">behavior the liar tries to get you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.039" end="00:35:28.930" style="s2">believe something is true and that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.740" end="00:35:31.029" style="s2">how your behavior will change because</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.930" end="00:35:32.829" style="s2">you one of the things that changes your</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.029" end="00:35:37.710" style="s2">behavior is your belief that something</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.829" end="00:35:41.319" style="s2">is true is a cognitive norm for people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.710" end="00:35:42.100" style="s2">in contrast the artist doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.319" end="00:35:44.260" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.100" end="00:35:46.750" style="s2">the artist relies on something</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.260" end="00:35:47.710" style="s2">else that&#39;s cognitively important for</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.750" end="00:35:50.560" style="s2">your behavior something I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.710" end="00:35:53.470" style="s2">mentioning throughout this talk how</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.560" end="00:35:56.700" style="s2">salient you find information to be which</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.470" end="00:36:00.070" style="s2">is different from how true it is right</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.700" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">what the artist does is</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.070" end="00:36:07.960" style="s2">uncouple the salience machinery from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:09.310" style="s2">truth commitment machinery so my</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.960" end="00:36:12.820" style="s2">favorite example of this and I&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.310" end="00:36:17.890" style="s2">it before is from an episode of The</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.820" end="00:36:19.690" style="s2">Simpsons back when I watched it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.890" end="00:36:21.310" style="s2">does anybody still I mean it&#39;s on TV but</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.690" end="00:36:23.800" style="s2">nobody claims to watch it anymore it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.310" end="00:36:26.530" style="s2">very mysterious cultural phenomenon but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.800" end="00:36:28.690" style="s2">back there was a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.530" end="00:36:32.650" style="s2">this has become somewhat famous as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.690" end="00:36:34.540" style="s2">example of is there&#39;s a alien</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.650" end="00:36:35.860" style="s2">giving a speech cang and he&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.540" end="00:36:38.100" style="s2">for political office in the United</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.860" end="00:36:38.100" style="s2">States</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.509" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">and right and and he gives the following</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.999" end="00:36:52.380" style="s2">speech he says my fellow Americans when</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:54.390" style="s2">I was young I dreamt of being a baseball</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.380" end="00:36:57.329" style="s2">but now we must move forward not</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.390" end="00:37:01.140" style="s2">backwards upwards not forward twirling</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.329" end="00:37:03.779" style="s2">twirling towards freedom and like you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.140" end="00:37:05.369" style="s2">get that sort of rush and all this</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.779" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">salient stuff that you and you get this</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.369" end="00:37:09.239" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a cascade right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:11.789" style="s2">like it&#39;s a pseudo insight cascade you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.239" end="00:37:16.460" style="s2">get one moment of salience priming the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.789" end="00:37:21.089" style="s2">next in you and nothing has been sad</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.460" end="00:37:24.799" style="s2">right nothing has been sad we have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.089" end="00:37:27.660" style="s2">tremendous capacity to do that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.799" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">like salience is directly affected by</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.660" end="00:37:32.130" style="s2">your attack attention and you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:33.690" style="s2">control over your attention you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.130" end="00:37:35.849" style="s2">alter salience about how you direct</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.690" end="00:37:38.519" style="s2">attention you don&#39;t have the same direct</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.849" end="00:37:40.769" style="s2">control over your beliefs you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.519" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">a belief you&#39;d like to have that</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.769" end="00:37:49.289" style="s2">everybody loves you believe it do it now</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:51.420" style="s2">you could imagine it but belief doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.289" end="00:37:53.249" style="s2">work that way but because salience is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.420" end="00:37:55.499" style="s2">wrapped up with attention and what you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.249" end="00:37:58.559" style="s2">can do is you can direct your attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.499" end="00:38:00.630" style="s2">and change your salience which then</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.559" end="00:38:02.089" style="s2">calls your attention more that way which</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.630" end="00:38:04.920" style="s2">direction and that can become a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.089" end="00:38:06.359" style="s2">self-reinforcing process now why does</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.920" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">this why is it so important why am I</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.359" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">going on about this because I think and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:14.609" style="s2">this isn&#39;t something Frankfort said this</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:18.200" style="s2">is something I think what was implying</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.609" end="00:38:21.059" style="s2">but he didn&#39;t pick up on right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.200" end="00:38:23.279" style="s2">self-deception we try to understand we</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.059" end="00:38:24.690" style="s2">we use metaphors of lying to yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.279" end="00:38:26.099" style="s2">explain self-deception he&#39;s lying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.690" end="00:38:29.809" style="s2">himself she&#39;s lying you can&#39;t lie to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.099" end="00:38:32.190" style="s2">yourself it doesn&#39;t make any sense you</p>

<p begin="00:38:38.310" end="00:38:45.250" style="s2">but and that&#39;s because belief is not a</p>

<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:51.840" style="s2">altered states of consciousness should</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.420" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">be pursued in a way that increases the</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:41:01.290" style="s2">they should be pursued in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:04.830" style="s2">justifies the risk of altering our state</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.290" end="00:41:06.270" style="s2">of consciousness and that gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.830" end="00:41:09.330" style="s2">cognitive ability to cut through</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.270" end="00:41:12.810" style="s2"> and what I want to suggest to</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.330" end="00:41:15.450" style="s2">you is of course the wisdom gives us all</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.810" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">three of those wisdom is about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.450" end="00:41:20.790" style="s2">alter your behavior so that you increase</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">reward and reduce risk and what better</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.790" end="00:41:29.340" style="s2">justifies risk than wisdom what else</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:33.990" style="s2">most contributes to how meaningful your</p>

<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:45.900" style="s2">the best antidote to and one</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.650" end="00:41:47.310" style="s2">way of defining what wisdom is is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.900" end="00:41:50.000" style="s2">wisdom is the ability to cut through</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.310" end="00:41:52.200" style="s2"> it is the ability to overcome</p>

<p begin="00:41:58.350" end="00:42:07.230" style="s2">right that&#39;s a different thing so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:09.330" style="s2">should bring good judgment to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.230" end="00:42:12.030" style="s2">the altered states of consciousness we</p>
