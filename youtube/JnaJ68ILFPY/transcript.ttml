<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">of people in terms of creativity but</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:43.649" style="s2">also in terms of people using it for</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:01.560" style="s2">his his PhD is actually in religious</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:03.450" style="s2">studies and he really looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.560" end="00:02:06.060" style="s2">intersection between technology and kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.450" end="00:02:08.819" style="s2">of the religious impulse and tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.060" end="00:02:10.890" style="s2">subcultures very you know one of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:12.030" style="s2">famous books is called tech gnosis so</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.890" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.030" end="00:02:14.819" style="s2">intersection</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:16.890" style="s2">between all those ideas it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.819" end="00:02:18.900" style="s2">about how the religious impulse comes up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:21.989" style="s2">through technology and it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.900" end="00:02:25.799" style="s2">big part of yeah the tech subculture</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.989" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">yeah so and I think yeah we want to sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.799" end="00:02:30.329" style="s2">of fill in the gaps explain why</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:31.769" style="s2">so we&#39;ve now done we did the Michael</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.329" end="00:02:33.569" style="s2">Pollan interview which we called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.769" end="00:02:36.390" style="s2">psychedelic Renaissance about three</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.569" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">weeks ago and then we did an interview</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.390" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">with Jamie Weil who is a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">expert also talks a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">psychedelics and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:51.989" style="s2">we have yeah it&#39;s a big interest of ours</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:53.609" style="s2">we both got kind of a history with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.989" end="00:02:59.790" style="s2">psychedelic festival breakin convention</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.609" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of those areas of real kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.790" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">of a sense of sort of possibility for</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">shifting ways of thinking and shifting</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:08.970" style="s2">culture and I think that&#39;s why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:10.950" style="s2">interested in it and especially there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.970" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">a lot of talk right now and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.950" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">we&#39;re both firm believers in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:16.079" style="s2">importance of being able to move beyond</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:17.970" style="s2">ideology to have generative</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.079" end="00:03:19.319" style="s2">conversations you know something</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.970" end="00:03:22.590" style="s2">starting to see in the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.319" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">darkweb it seems absolutely essential if</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.590" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to find direction in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">kind of chaotic times we live in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">psychedelics more than any other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:39.019" style="s2">know about our deconditioning agents and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:42.959" style="s2">decondition ideology incredibly well</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.019" end="00:03:44.099" style="s2">however they can go both ways and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.959" end="00:03:46.260" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of the really</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.099" end="00:03:48.599" style="s2">interesting synchronicity is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.260" end="00:03:51.319" style="s2">Michael Pollan&#39;s book has come out and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.599" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">really bringing to the mainstream for</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.319" end="00:03:56.040" style="s2">maybe not for the first time but in a in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">a very new way the the power of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.040" end="00:03:59.720" style="s2">substances and so the other questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:02.699" style="s2">are how does one use them correctly and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.720" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">how yeah how do we navigate it because</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.699" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">obviously you know we&#39;re sitting right</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:10.019" style="s2">now in San Francisco and in the late 60s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:12.449" style="s2">there really was a massive mainstreaming</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.019" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">of psychedelics that didn&#39;t go all that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.449" end="00:04:17.250" style="s2">well it had its benefit it had massive</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:18.419" style="s2">downfalls as well so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.250" end="00:04:20.310" style="s2">kind of an open question I guess we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.419" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">been asking people about and toying with</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.310" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">ourselves is how do we use them most</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">effectively moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.010" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re literally about</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:30.330" style="s2">half a mile from Haight Ashbury from</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:32.460" style="s2">literally the intersection of Haight</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.330" end="00:04:35.460" style="s2">Ashbury which was ground zero for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.460" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">60s and the interesting question because</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.460" end="00:04:40.620" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about kind of ideological</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:42.480" style="s2">fixation and the interesting question is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.620" end="00:04:46.470" style="s2">they were counter cultural agents in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.480" end="00:04:49.020" style="s2">60s kind of the 1950s and 1960s there</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.470" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">there was a very sort of firm cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.020" end="00:04:53.370" style="s2">kind of traditionalist culture and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:56.460" style="s2">were what they were one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.370" end="00:04:59.220" style="s2">things that challenged that so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:05:01.800" style="s2">question that we&#39;re asking is are they</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.220" end="00:05:03.420" style="s2">still deconditioning agents or is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.800" end="00:05:04.860" style="s2">because the ideology that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.420" end="00:05:08.100" style="s2">nowadays is a very different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.860" end="00:05:09.630" style="s2">ideology and I think we&#39;ve all we we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.100" end="00:05:11.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a lot of films and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.630" end="00:05:14.190" style="s2">conversations about the nature of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.040" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">new ideology are they still those kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.190" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">of deconditioning agents given the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">that the new ideology is is much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:23.340" style="s2">the ideology that actually emerged from</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:24.630" style="s2">the 60s and we could argue we do argue</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.340" end="00:05:28.440" style="s2">has kind of become corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.630" end="00:05:31.110" style="s2">it started we&#39;ve used kembers work quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.440" end="00:05:33.150" style="s2">a lot talking about it started as a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.110" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">positive development that what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.150" end="00:05:40.530" style="s2">the green meme which is equality and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:42.660" style="s2">relativism and listening to other voices</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.530" end="00:05:45.780" style="s2">and including marginalized perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.660" end="00:05:47.550" style="s2">that is a good thing but then it became</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.780" end="00:05:50.370" style="s2">corrupt and became an ideology in its</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.550" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">own right and do psychedelics still play</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:55.020" style="s2">the same role that now that they played</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">then yeah and as we&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.020" end="00:05:58.410" style="s2">asking people about it and I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:05:59.790" style="s2">about it as well and even as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.410" end="00:06:01.590" style="s2">talking I&#39;m I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.790" end="00:06:05.850" style="s2">inquiring into that myself am i yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.590" end="00:06:09.030" style="s2">actually I do think that they can still</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.850" end="00:06:10.530" style="s2">decondition from any ideology you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.030" end="00:06:12.570" style="s2">if you if you look at shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.530" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">throughout history psychedelics have</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.570" end="00:06:17.490" style="s2">been used for war they&#39;ve been used for</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">peace they&#39;ve been used to heal they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.490" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">been used to harm the you know Jim</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:25.880" style="s2">Fadiman who who we saw today is a big</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:28.680" style="s2">proponent of a real core aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.880" end="00:06:32.190" style="s2">psychedelic usage which is setting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.680" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">set so setting is where you are always</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.190" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">that set is what you&#39;re bringing to it</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:38.910" style="s2">yourself and those two things can really</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:43.770" style="s2">have a big big impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.910" end="00:06:45.630" style="s2">on it so in a sense you know part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.770" end="00:06:48.990" style="s2">interesting one interesting question is</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.630" end="00:06:52.470" style="s2">how do we create the kind of setting and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.990" end="00:06:53.580" style="s2">set now moving forward where a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:56.100" style="s2">people probably going to try</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.580" end="00:06:58.530" style="s2">psychedelics that&#39;s conducive to moving</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.100" end="00:07:00.660" style="s2">away from ideology rather than deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.530" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">to the ideology we&#39;re in now because</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.660" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">that could happen and that would be not</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:11.630" style="s2">a good thing yeah because we my question</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:14.430" style="s2">to Michael Pollan was is your book a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.630" end="00:07:16.290" style="s2">moment where psychedelics become</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.430" end="00:07:17.670" style="s2">mainstream and he kind of said that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.290" end="00:07:19.380" style="s2">was and pretty much everyone we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.670" end="00:07:21.810" style="s2">spoken to since we&#39;ve been here have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.380" end="00:07:24.330" style="s2">group has agreed that yes this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.810" end="00:07:25.980" style="s2">significant moment New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.330" end="00:07:28.170" style="s2">best-selling writer has written a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.980" end="00:07:31.200" style="s2">best-selling book about psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.170" end="00:07:32.970" style="s2">therapy people are people who have never</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.200" end="00:07:35.340" style="s2">tried psychedelics are saying wow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.970" end="00:07:38.070" style="s2">interested to try this it definitely is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.340" end="00:07:39.930" style="s2">that crossover point so we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.070" end="00:07:42.690" style="s2">been part of this conversation for I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.930" end="00:07:45.470" style="s2">guess 10 years or so I first did a story</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.690" end="00:07:47.700" style="s2">about psychedelic therapy back in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.470" end="00:07:50.370" style="s2">you&#39;ve been part of the breakin</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.700" end="00:07:52.410" style="s2">convention Festival for a long time so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.370" end="00:07:54.780" style="s2">guess what we&#39;re interested in doing is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.410" end="00:07:56.250" style="s2">is pushing that conversation on ok.now</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.780" end="00:07:57.750" style="s2">the mainstream starting to recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.250" end="00:08:02.940" style="s2">value of psychedelics okay fine</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.750" end="00:08:05.850" style="s2">but what that in itself is not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:07.620" style="s2">not the end point the end point like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.850" end="00:08:10.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve always been very frustrated with</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.620" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">the psychedelic community of almost like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.530" end="00:08:15.090" style="s2">fetishizing the psychedelic experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.400" style="s2">and not learning the deeper lessons of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.090" end="00:08:20.280" style="s2">psychedelic experience which even going</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.400" end="00:08:23.070" style="s2">back to Aldous Huxley was psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.280" end="00:08:24.930" style="s2">cleanse the doors of perception but you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.070" end="00:08:28.020" style="s2">see things so they remove a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.930" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">filters so you see a lot of things more</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.020" end="00:08:33.300" style="s2">true to how they are how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.080" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2">we start to live in that space how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.300" end="00:08:37.500" style="s2">start to live beyond the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2">experience and not just kind of psycho</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.500" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">yeah fetishize the drug and fetishize</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">that state of mind and actually work on</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:48.750" style="s2">because I I firmly believe and this has</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:51.510" style="s2">been absolutely true for me that we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.750" end="00:08:52.769" style="s2">to do the inner work psychedelics we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.510" end="00:08:54.239" style="s2">a few freebies we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.769" end="00:08:56.670" style="s2">you kind of insights into how things</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.239" end="00:08:59.519" style="s2">could be beyond our conditioning beyond</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.670" end="00:09:01.709" style="s2">wow I&#39;m one with the universe I I know</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.519" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">what my true nature is all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.709" end="00:09:07.920" style="s2">stuff and it&#39;s like yes great true but</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:10.949" style="s2">it&#39;s an ever decreasing circle if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.920" end="00:09:13.019" style="s2">keep just doing the drug without doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.949" end="00:09:14.759" style="s2">the inner work to really identify the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.019" end="00:09:18.029" style="s2">blocks in yourself that stop you being</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.759" end="00:09:20.699" style="s2">in that space no not necessarily all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.029" end="00:09:22.230" style="s2">time but what are the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.699" end="00:09:24.569" style="s2">stopping you from from being in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.230" end="00:09:27.540" style="s2">state of flow in the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.569" end="00:09:29.009" style="s2">yeah and this is something that so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.540" end="00:09:31.649" style="s2">the last breakin convention happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.009" end="00:09:33.809" style="s2">every two years and the last two so</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.649" end="00:09:35.549" style="s2">starting in 2013 I think this has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.809" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">the topic I&#39;ve written and I&#39;m spoken</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.549" end="00:09:42.569" style="s2">about which is I&#39;ve called a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:44.369" style="s2">Shadow it&#39;s this idea that well so in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.569" end="00:09:47.339" style="s2">kind of summary you can take</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.369" end="00:09:49.589" style="s2">psychedelics for 20 years and be having</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.339" end="00:09:52.100" style="s2">these peak experiences which I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.589" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">call vertical that&#39;s kind of up and down</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.100" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">and you can still Jim Philemon put it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:09:58.980" style="s2">nicely you can still want to kill</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:01.649" style="s2">someone when they cut you off when</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.980" end="00:10:03.089" style="s2">you&#39;re driving and you can still you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.649" end="00:10:05.220" style="s2">know here he also had a nice example</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.089" end="00:10:06.869" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you love everything but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.220" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">hate my parents you know so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.869" end="00:10:09.420" style="s2">something missing there this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:12.649" style="s2">something I started to see first in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.420" end="00:10:14.879" style="s2">myself and then what actually helped me</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.649" end="00:10:16.709" style="s2">kind of get out of it a bit was having a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.879" end="00:10:19.019" style="s2">really dark experience and encountering</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.709" end="00:10:20.279" style="s2">my shadow and realizing oh it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.019" end="00:10:23.309" style="s2">love and light</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:25.709" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve kind of I&#39;m loosely</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.309" end="00:10:27.929" style="s2">developing is is a model I call train</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.709" end="00:10:29.670" style="s2">trip integrate which is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.929" end="00:10:31.319" style="s2">not you don&#39;t just need the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.670" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">you need what you were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.319" end="00:10:35.549" style="s2">about the sorry of the vertical you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:40.980" style="s2">the horizontal as well and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.549" end="00:10:43.679" style="s2">horizontal is the kind of work so work</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.980" end="00:10:45.869" style="s2">where you and you you work with other</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.679" end="00:10:49.470" style="s2">people it kind of did various types of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.869" end="00:10:51.029" style="s2">therapy bodywork meditation a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.470" end="00:10:52.949" style="s2">different ways of understanding yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.029" end="00:10:54.689" style="s2">and how you relate to other people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.949" end="00:10:57.869" style="s2">get away from the potential narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.689" end="00:10:58.799" style="s2">and away from the potential lack of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.869" end="00:11:01.439" style="s2">development that comes with just</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.799" end="00:11:03.660" style="s2">tripping and tripping and tripping and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.439" end="00:11:06.660" style="s2">that is something that the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.660" end="00:11:08.070" style="s2">community I think needs to really look</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.660" end="00:11:11.430" style="s2">or something Jaime will was talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.070" end="00:11:12.810" style="s2">about and I think what he said that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.430" end="00:11:15.450" style="s2">really really interesting that really</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.810" end="00:11:17.250" style="s2">struck a chord with me was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.450" end="00:11:19.830" style="s2">he he&#39;s traditionally come from the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.250" end="00:11:21.990" style="s2">of ecstatic those ecstatic moments and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.830" end="00:11:23.550" style="s2">how do you get into that kind of place</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.990" end="00:11:24.300" style="s2">and how does that then lead to being in</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.550" end="00:11:26.730" style="s2">a flow State</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.300" end="00:11:29.280" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is really bringing up</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.730" end="00:11:32.130" style="s2">the catharsis the lower levels that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.280" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">all hard one kind of feels this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.130" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">deep practical wisdom and it really</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:39.870" style="s2">feels like that&#39;s been missing from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:41.130" style="s2">psychedelic world it&#39;s all you know a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.870" end="00:11:43.260" style="s2">lot of the time it&#39;s all love and light</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.130" end="00:11:46.140" style="s2">and crystals and bollocks like that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.260" end="00:11:48.600" style="s2">what it needs is the real encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.140" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">the shadow and on that point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.600" end="00:11:53.310" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the the points I made in</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:57.090" style="s2">what I wrote breaking invention is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:12:00.060" style="s2">the traditions like meditation they</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.090" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">don&#39;t generally look at the shadow in</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.060" end="00:12:04.170" style="s2">the traditional uses something Ken</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:05.730" style="s2">Wilber Wilber points out you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.170" end="00:12:07.710" style="s2">meditate for 50 years as well and still</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.730" end="00:12:09.000" style="s2">be a massive asshole because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.710" end="00:12:11.190" style="s2">looking at the sides of yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.000" end="00:12:12.900" style="s2">you reject necessarily so you need</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.190" end="00:12:15.420" style="s2">something or some combination of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.900" end="00:12:18.510" style="s2">practices that allows you to own your</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.420" end="00:12:20.100" style="s2">shadow allows you to know how to connect</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.510" end="00:12:22.350" style="s2">with other people in a way and have</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.100" end="00:12:24.780" style="s2">reflection on yourself and then also</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.350" end="00:12:26.370" style="s2">allows you to break into spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.780" end="00:12:28.260" style="s2">you think differently and where you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.370" end="00:12:30.600" style="s2">break free from your constricted thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.260" end="00:12:31.830" style="s2">structures so the point being it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.600" end="00:12:33.630" style="s2">as simple as people just taking</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.830" end="00:12:36.270" style="s2">psychedelics a lot more has to go into</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.630" end="00:12:39.630" style="s2">it yeah I just had a sort of thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.270" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">truth is a psychedelic truth is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.630" end="00:12:44.100" style="s2">psychedelic experience and this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">something that Jordan Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.100" end="00:12:49.920" style="s2">about that aligning oneself with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:51.060" style="s2">truth is is what that&#39;s the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.920" end="00:12:53.250" style="s2">story of Western culture that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.060" end="00:12:54.810" style="s2">logos and magical things happen when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.250" end="00:12:57.000" style="s2">align ourselves with the truth I&#39;d never</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.810" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">really framed it in that way but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.000" end="00:13:02.040" style="s2">has certainly been my journey since I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:05.310" style="s2">did a lot of psychedelics at university</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.040" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">and found it a really awakening</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.310" end="00:13:08.280" style="s2">experience at first but I went through</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:10.680" style="s2">that experience of ever decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.280" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">circles and actually it took me quite a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.680" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">long time to recover from that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:16.230" style="s2">chasing that high and feeling I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:18.060" style="s2">coined the phrase living in the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.230" end="00:13:19.740" style="s2">of myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.060" end="00:13:23.550" style="s2">getting this sort of sense of who I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.740" end="00:13:25.310" style="s2">could be beyond all of this stuff just a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.550" end="00:13:28.290" style="s2">stuff that we live in on a daily basis</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.310" end="00:13:30.420" style="s2">and chasing that high and chasing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.290" end="00:13:32.700" style="s2">experience but then always coming down</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.420" end="00:13:34.350" style="s2">and and still still really struggling</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.700" end="00:13:36.510" style="s2">with with various things and it almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.350" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">it being worse because I had a taste of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.510" end="00:13:40.050" style="s2">what it would have been like without all</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.840" style="s2">of the kind of the day-to-day stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:45.540" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until I started doing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.840" end="00:13:47.220" style="s2">personal growth work you know work that</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.540" end="00:13:48.990" style="s2">I then started to kind of identify those</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.220" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">places in myself okay this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.990" end="00:13:53.790" style="s2">shut down this is where I&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:55.740" style="s2">kind of swing between grandiosity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.790" end="00:13:57.780" style="s2">worthlessness and all of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.740" end="00:14:02.820" style="s2">personality patterns that yeah I got</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.780" end="00:14:04.620" style="s2">from my parents I got from my yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.820" end="00:14:06.990" style="s2">of this other boring individual stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.620" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">that we all have that kind of keeps us</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.990" end="00:14:11.190" style="s2">trapped in some ways and it was only by</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:13.500" style="s2">doing all of that inner work that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.190" end="00:14:17.850" style="s2">really started to kind of align all</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.500" end="00:14:21.660" style="s2">those parts of myself and it the space</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.850" end="00:14:23.460" style="s2">that opens up for me you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.660" end="00:14:24.990" style="s2">workshop of sort of five or six days but</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.460" end="00:14:27.180" style="s2">I&#39;m really sort of speaking my truth and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.990" end="00:14:29.190" style="s2">really like dredging stuff off I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.180" end="00:14:33.270" style="s2">really identifying it is a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.190" end="00:14:35.840" style="s2">experience and the risk of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.270" end="00:14:38.910" style="s2">giving a plug for our workshops that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.840" end="00:14:42.630" style="s2">what comes in with two or three days in</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.910" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">a workshop experience you find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.630" end="00:14:47.940" style="s2">these yeah it becomes this very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:51.180" style="s2">transformative where you can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.940" end="00:14:57.240" style="s2">you can feel in in in the room like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.180" end="00:14:59.730" style="s2">that level of what truth magic it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.240" end="00:15:02.790" style="s2">it&#39;s a similar space and so it&#39;s a flow</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.730" end="00:15:05.700" style="s2">state in that sense yeah and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.790" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">a really nice point because for me and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.700" end="00:15:10.710" style="s2">and for people who do psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.290" style="s2">therapy professionally as well the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.710" end="00:15:15.090" style="s2">is absolutely the key element of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.290" end="00:15:17.850" style="s2">experience that&#39;s that&#39;s curative</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.090" end="00:15:19.800" style="s2">because you can&#39;t hide on a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.850" end="00:15:22.230" style="s2">you can&#39;t hide from yourself and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.800" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">truth is inner truth it&#39;s not so much</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.230" end="00:15:26.220" style="s2">the truth of this is how the universe is</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:27.810" style="s2">all constructed because you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.220" end="00:15:29.700" style="s2">share that with other people you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.810" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s about your your own inner truth so</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.700" end="00:15:33.430" style="s2">it&#39;s around you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:35.529" style="s2">phenomenologically you&#39;re sitting and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.430" end="00:15:38.499" style="s2">something&#39;s coming up some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.529" end="00:15:40.660" style="s2">negative feeling and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.499" end="00:15:42.579" style="s2">acknowledge and go into it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.660" end="00:15:45.579" style="s2">this is true you might not want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.579" end="00:15:48.430" style="s2">true but it&#39;s true it&#39;s happening and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.579" end="00:15:50.559" style="s2">whatever is coming up psychologically is</p>
