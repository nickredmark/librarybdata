<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:08.400" style="s2">copy in to grips with the fact I&#39;m queer</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.500" end="00:00:11.070" style="s2">alerting</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:15.980" style="s2">I&#39;m covering it in my own personality I</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.070" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">was in this school which was like a</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.980" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">business school for hippies how to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:24.300" style="s2">a social enterprise how to and we met a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">few times a week it was the first time I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.300" end="00:00:29.699" style="s2">had had people surrounding me who truly</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:31.470" style="s2">understood what it was like I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.699" end="00:00:34.860" style="s2">I could show up have a disability and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">not be seen as less than that I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.860" end="00:00:38.070" style="s2">figuring out my identity but I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">forget my identity and that piece and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.070" end="00:00:41.969" style="s2">was the first time I encountered people</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:45.120" style="s2">who identified as something other than</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.969" end="00:00:48.090" style="s2">the binary genders and it broke my brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:50.190" style="s2">both because grammatically I had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.090" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">really hard time getting my mind around</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.190" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">they/them pronouns not wanting to accept</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">it but just grammatically I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.449" style="s2">don&#39;t understand where I use it and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">don&#39;t understand I was translating</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.449" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">constantly from heat I mean they she I</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.750" style="s2">mean they and and they had to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">put up with it for it for that period of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.750" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">my life because that was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">capable of in the moment and I did I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:15.930" style="s2">tried my hardest but my hardest was</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.070" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">constantly failing at it and then I had</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.930" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">friends who went through who were in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">same class as me who after the class</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">ended up changing their pronouns to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">today them and that was even more</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">difficult because I had known them as as</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:34.829" style="s2">different ones and so I messed up even</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">more with with their pronouns and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.829" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">were even more gracious about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">so I&#39;m very grateful for that but there</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">was something he wasn&#39;t just the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">pronouns which was a grammatical thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:44.810" style="s2">and just a language and I have</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:47.250" style="s2">difficulty with language but it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.810" end="00:01:51.119" style="s2">encountering people who were non-binary</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.250" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">for the first time made me question how</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.119" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">differently I treat the binary I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:57.299" style="s2">know which box to put them in I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">know whether they were men and I should</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.299" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">treat them as men or they were women and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:02.670" style="s2">I should treat them as women and it made</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:04.500" style="s2">me uncomfortable to think that was even</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.670" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">the case like wait do I really treat men</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.500" end="00:02:08.830" style="s2">and women that differently yes yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:12.100" style="s2">especially as a heterosexual female</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.830" end="00:02:15.610" style="s2">identified at the time so that was like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.100" end="00:02:18.760" style="s2">the beginning of my what I&#39;ve lovingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.610" end="00:02:22.210" style="s2">referred to as the gender of going</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.760" end="00:02:23.620" style="s2">into this space of like wait how much of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.210" end="00:02:26.290" style="s2">me resonates with this gender and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.620" end="00:02:27.880" style="s2">realizing that for for trans women in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.290" end="00:02:30.580" style="s2">particular there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.880" end="00:02:34.630" style="s2">which there was something about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.580" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2">that somebody could be labeled as male</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.630" end="00:02:43.240" style="s2">have the body that is labeled as male</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:44.680" style="s2">and reside yet identify so strongly with</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.240" end="00:02:46.810" style="s2">being a woman there&#39;s like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.680" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2"> care what you think I&#39;m a woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.810" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">and I never felt that struggling there</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">was the only reason I felt I was woman</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:03:02.830" style="s2">it&#39;s because I had the body like I got</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">the parts I don&#39;t my woman check that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.830" end="00:03:09.540" style="s2">box and so I had no problem with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.350" end="00:03:15.190" style="s2">allowing trans women into the womanhood</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">cuz I was like if you feel that strongly</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.190" end="00:03:18.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re willing to check that box I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:22.870" style="s2">don&#39;t even feel that strongly I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.160" end="00:03:24.130" style="s2">willing to check that box and that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.870" end="00:03:25.570" style="s2">more important it was like the inner</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.130" end="00:03:25.900" style="s2">being I was like I don&#39;t have none of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.570" end="00:03:28.510" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.900" end="00:03:30.580" style="s2">and so it also made me question looking</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.510" end="00:03:32.500" style="s2">back like how much of Who I am is trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:35.080" style="s2">to be a woman thinking I should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.500" end="00:03:37.180" style="s2">feminine to attract a man think I should</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.080" end="00:03:38.920" style="s2">be these things that I don&#39;t feel feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.180" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">like I&#39;m failing at being a woman in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.920" end="00:03:44.590" style="s2">like it just made me question everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:47.500" style="s2">and it was the beginning of accepting</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.590" end="00:03:49.390" style="s2">Who I am not caring whether I&#39;m feminine</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.500" end="00:03:54.850" style="s2">or masculine not caring which box I</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.390" end="00:03:57.130" style="s2">check just being and I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.850" end="00:04:00.040" style="s2">identify as dawn by I do identify some</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.130" end="00:04:03.850" style="s2">binary and gender identify as a female</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.040" end="00:04:05.650" style="s2">that is non-binary and but I go by</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.850" end="00:04:07.930" style="s2">she/her because the pronouns break my</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.650" end="00:04:09.850" style="s2">brain so I will I will honor it for</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.930" end="00:04:12.580" style="s2">other people but for me I&#39;m like no she</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.850" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">heard just works better for for Who I am</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.580" end="00:04:17.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">know what to say but there was four</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.390" end="00:04:20.660" style="s2">minutes in I don&#39;t gonna get to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:22.340" style="s2">other I guess this is a just gender and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.660" end="00:04:29.260" style="s2">so they&#39;ll be queer part 1 and queer</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.340" end="00:04:31.870" style="s2">part 2 so yeah and I also know how</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.260" end="00:04:36.950" style="s2">tumultuous and hard this journey was</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.870" end="00:04:38.390" style="s2">internally for me that I get why people</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.950" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">aren&#39;t willing to go on the gender</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.390" end="00:04:43.460" style="s2">journey that it hurts them at a soul</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:45.860" style="s2">level it breaks their brain to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:47.750" style="s2">other people walking around on binary</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.860" end="00:04:50.600" style="s2">because they don&#39;t know which box to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.750" end="00:04:53.270" style="s2">them in and they probably don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.600" end="00:04:58.760" style="s2">know how to articulate that there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.270" end="00:05:03.970" style="s2">like this wrongness about it and we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.760" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">to be able to hold that tension of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.970" end="00:05:08.690" style="s2">both of those things is true we have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:10.670" style="s2">as a society go through the gender</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.690" end="00:05:13.340" style="s2">and it&#39;s a hard thing to do and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.670" end="00:05:15.830" style="s2">cannot require it of other people both</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.340" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">simultaneously and so everyone kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.830" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">has to do it in their own time is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">conclusions I have come to and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:23.930" style="s2">not the true conclusions they&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">conclusions and so this is part one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.930" end="00:05:26.980" style="s2">queerness thank you</p>
