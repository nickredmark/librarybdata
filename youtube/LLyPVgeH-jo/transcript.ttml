<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:08.040" style="s2">well this is lecture 6 and it&#39;s on sex</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.210" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">differences in personality and so the</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.040" end="00:00:11.969" style="s2">first thing that you should be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:13.889" style="s2">this is the reason I put it in after</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.969" end="00:00:16.680" style="s2">neuroticism and agreeableness is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.889" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">the biggest differences in temperament</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.680" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">personality between men and women are in</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:27.289" style="s2">agreeableness and neuroticism and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">seems to be true cross culturally and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.289" end="00:00:32.009" style="s2">because you know one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:33.540" style="s2">want to know is so look look what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.009" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">happened is that psychologists have</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.540" end="00:00:40.260" style="s2">established a relatively a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">model of personality and I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.260" end="00:00:46.379" style="s2">that there was any bias built into it or</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.190" end="00:00:48.530" style="s2">at least that the biased was minimized</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.379" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">by the method because the method was</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.530" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">asked people as many questions as you</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:56.460" style="s2">possibly can and use statistical methods</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">by multiple teams to sort out the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.460" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">relationships between the answers and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">you know I thought that Big Five was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:04.860" style="s2">pretty ugly theory when I first came</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:07.729" style="s2">across it it wasn&#39;t one that I warmed up</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.860" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">too quickly I would say it probably took</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.729" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">between five and ten years before I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">convinced by the brute power of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">analysis that it had to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:23.479" style="s2">seriously and as that happened because</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">the theory was first laid out only</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.479" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">linguistically and statistically there</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">was no neuro psychology there was no</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">neurobiology there was no real theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">there was no developmental theory it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:37.110" style="s2">just lexical description and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">kind of was call so it was like a theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.110" end="00:01:41.250" style="s2">in search of a place to exist as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2">because of course before it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.250" end="00:01:45.450" style="s2">established we didn&#39;t know what it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">also capable of predicting and that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">got built up around that say five to ten</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:52.530" style="s2">year period - and it became more as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:54.119" style="s2">started to understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.530" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">between the descriptors and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.119" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">underlying biology then the theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:03.750" style="s2">became richer and more useful and also</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">more credible but but but that actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.750" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">that actually had certain benefits its</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">lack of initial theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">attractiveness because it also mitigated</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">against bias you know because if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:15.450" style="s2">find a theory attractive</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.910" style="s2">for whatever reason then you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.450" end="00:02:19.740" style="s2">likely to maybe be biased in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.910" end="00:02:22.020" style="s2">evidence that&#39;s supported and I really</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:24.900" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.020" end="00:02:26.340" style="s2">develop the big5 theory were very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.900" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">affected by that I mean there are people</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.340" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">who built their reputation on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">theory and of course they would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">biased in favor of pushing their career</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">forward but peer review when it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.500" style="s2">properly keeps that nicely under control</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:42.540" style="s2">and then the fact that multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.500" end="00:02:44.070" style="s2">different methods have converged on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.540" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">same model and that there&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.070" end="00:02:48.240" style="s2">evidence that it remains you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:49.710" style="s2">reasonably stable cross-culturally and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.240" end="00:02:51.270" style="s2">that it&#39;s associated with the child</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.710" end="00:02:53.370" style="s2">developmental literature that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.270" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">power pretty powerful convergent</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">evidence and and so well once you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">the theory laid out you can start to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.000" style="s2">it to ask and answer interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:04.920" style="s2">questions like well are there</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.000" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">differences between men and women that&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.920" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">be the first pretty simple question and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.190" style="s2">the next question would be if there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:13.380" style="s2">differences well then why did those</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.190" end="00:03:14.790" style="s2">differences exist but you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.380" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">get to that to begin with you can just</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.790" end="00:03:20.880" style="s2">start with are there differences and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:23.160" style="s2">answer is yes there are differences and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.880" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you what they are what we know</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.160" end="00:03:29.990" style="s2">so far so by far the biggest differences</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:32.220" style="s2">are in extraversion or agreeableness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.990" end="00:03:35.370" style="s2">neuroticism and the biggest difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.220" end="00:03:39.180" style="s2">is actually in agreeableness and so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.370" end="00:03:41.790" style="s2">the the difference is roughly this if</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.180" end="00:03:44.520" style="s2">you picked a random man and a random</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.790" end="00:03:47.520" style="s2">woman out of the crowd and you said</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.520" end="00:03:49.860" style="s2">who&#39;s more aggressive and you bet on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.520" end="00:03:52.110" style="s2">woman you&#39;d be right 40 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.860" end="00:03:54.930" style="s2">time which is actually quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.110" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">the time so there&#39;s more overlap between</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.930" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">men and women and there are differences</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:00.840" style="s2">even in the dimensions where the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:02.970" style="s2">differences are the most pronounced and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:05.250" style="s2">then if you took a man and a woman out</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.970" end="00:04:07.050" style="s2">of a crowd and you asked who feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.250" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">negative emotion and you bet on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.050" end="00:04:11.940" style="s2">woman you&#39;d be right about 60% of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:13.980" style="s2">time and so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.940" end="00:04:16.080" style="s2">exactly right but it&#39;s close enough you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.980" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">get a flavor for it with with that with</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.080" end="00:04:19.620" style="s2">that degree of estimation and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:21.960" style="s2">first thing you note and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.620" end="00:04:23.729" style="s2">first thing to note from the comparisons</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.960" end="00:04:25.650" style="s2">of men and women is that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.729" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">are more alike than they are different</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.650" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">especially at</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:32.099" style="s2">trait level we did analysis with the big</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">five I never published this but I tried</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.099" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">to come up with a set of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:38.909" style="s2">would maximally differentiate men and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:41.940" style="s2">women so if you didn&#39;t know who had done</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.909" end="00:04:43.949" style="s2">the answering could you predict by the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.940" end="00:04:46.879" style="s2">pattern of answers and if I took the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.949" end="00:04:49.139" style="s2">most if I took the questions that most</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.879" end="00:04:51.509" style="s2">differentiated the best I could ever do</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.139" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">was about 75% and classification</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.509" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">accuracy and that&#39;s probably a bit of an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">overestimation because the statistical</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:02.699" style="s2">technique I used was predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">fact that we already knew which men in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.699" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">which women had answered these questions</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:11.069" style="s2">and so capitalized to some degree on</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">chance so my guess is that that if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.069" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">use personality testing and it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:18.509" style="s2">optimal you could probably get about 70%</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:21.180" style="s2">accuracy and classification maybe 65%</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.509" end="00:05:24.630" style="s2">something like that and and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.180" end="00:05:26.690" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.630" end="00:05:30.259" style="s2">not enough to think of men and women as</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.690" end="00:05:30.259" style="s2">fundamentally different</p>
