<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">um a few uh stowites</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">and i threw a little private session to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:38.959" style="s2">kind of get a vibe of what was going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">in the stowawa and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.959" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">get a sense of what the stoa wanted as</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">an essence</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">um and it was a fun little event and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:50.319" style="s2">what showed up was something around</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">dying and and mortality and existence in</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.319" end="00:02:54.879" style="s2">general and it was really beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">and one thing that came up was the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.879" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re in the middle of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">pandemic and hundreds of thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.920" style="s2">have died</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:04.239" style="s2">many of them have died alone um this</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.920" end="00:03:05.840" style="s2">uh you know hearing that i was reminded</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.239" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">of actually daniel speaking to this very</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.840" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">um and i was reminded of a grieving</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">practice that um that he knows</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:15.840" style="s2">at the same time and why this is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">important is because we haven&#39;t dealt</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.840" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">with this in any way new york times put</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">out a list of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">you know people that died in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:22.879" style="s2">of this and i think that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">all that the media or leadership is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.879" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">actually done in a form of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">of grieving a time like this with such</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">loss and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:33.519" style="s2">loneliness and at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:35.680" style="s2">speaks a little bit to leadership</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.519" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">um it speaks to a little bit of lack a</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.680" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">lot a bit of lack of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">and i think the stoa actually really</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">attracts a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">a lot of individuals that that may have</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">that in them you know they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:46.560" style="s2">these conversations that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">very hard and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.560" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">that these conversations are what uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:53.920" style="s2">what makes leaders</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">and in that i&#39;m reminded of daniel</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.920" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">schmokenberger saying you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">the power of gods right now as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">we don&#39;t have the wisdom to wield that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">in that i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m reminded and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:09.680" style="s2">question what are the what are the paths</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">and the tools that we can actually gain</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.680" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">that wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">and we have mindfulness uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">running rampant</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">and meditation techniques running</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">rampant in the west</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">but daniel&#39;s a part of a lineage that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.639" style="s2">something very special in it and it uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.639" style="s2">and he&#39;s gonna speak to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.639" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">um that has a goal of awakening and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.639" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">perhaps that goal can</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">and these practices can lead us to uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">awakened leaders and uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">buddhas in the west so uh daniel i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">gonna let you take this and um</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">we&#39;ll go from there thank you so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">gonna talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">western approaches to dying and grieving</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:45.360" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">first and i want to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.360" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">approaches in tibetan buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">so from a western perspective</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">grieving is a natural process to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">loss of someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">so when someone dies we we first go</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">through a stage of disbelief we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:01.360" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:02.720" style="s2">get it that the person has died we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">know we don&#39;t accept it we want to deny</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.720" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:06.880" style="s2">so we push out the memories and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">feelings of the person</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.880" end="00:05:10.160" style="s2">and then they alternate between coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.400" style="s2">back to us and then we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.160" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">work back and forth between denying the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.400" end="00:05:16.479" style="s2">feelings and memories and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">having the experience of them and over</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.479" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">time we eventually work it out and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">when the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">grieving process comes to a close that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">the normal grieving process</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">but for the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">100 years we&#39;ve through remaining</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a psychoanalytic tradition</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">we&#39;ve just looked at the grieving</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">process in great detail</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">and what we know is that some people</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">don&#39;t go through the normal grieving</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">process it doesn&#39;t end</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">we call that complicated morning and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.880" style="s2">what complicates the grieving process is</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:46.560" style="s2">usually conflict</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.880" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">so the relationships that we&#39;re closest</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.560" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">to and with the least conflictual are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">the ones that are easiest to mourn</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">but the ones that we&#39;re more conflicted</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">about are the ones the hardest to mourn</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:56.479" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">i been interested particularly in</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:04.319" style="s2">grieving</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">and some 20 years ago i found a grieving</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.319" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">protocol that was developed in australia</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">it was an obscure journal of hypnosis in</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">australia</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:16.400" style="s2">and what it described was 63 cases of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:18.319" style="s2">complicated bereavement</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.400" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">that were resolved completely in less</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.319" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">than three sessions</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">the average time was one or two sessions</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">and the maximum was three sessions that</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">raised my eyebrows</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:27.600" style="s2">so we looked at the protocol and as was</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">often</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.600" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">in in that generation people described</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">in general what they did but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">described in great detail</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">what they did so we didn&#39;t we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">extract</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">the method easily from the text that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">written about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:42.720" style="s2">so we put it in the process as well as</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">we could we used it for over 200 people</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:47.120" style="s2">and i found the same results</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">that we had a complete resolution of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.120" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">complicated morning in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">less than three sessions each time</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:58.240" style="s2">over 200 sessions so that amazed me</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">so this became very popular over time</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.240" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">and we sort of filled it out to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.520" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">mainstream i started teaching grief</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">workshops around the country</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">and then internationally and uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">it became a very popular way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">the grieving process i will do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">method with you</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">at the end of this talk before we get to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">the question and answer we&#39;ll actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">go through it</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">so your task is to think about some loss</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">that you never really fight</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">got over and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll go through it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">as a process</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">is you can do it on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:29.039" style="s2">individually that you it doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.039" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">lost through dying it can be also a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">relationship you never quite over the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">person still</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">they&#39;re still alive but they still lost</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">so you can use it either way</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">let me turn now to we&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">this exercise i&#39;ll do it for you the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">best way of doing it is just do it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">but when i come back to the western</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">eastern approach to dying</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:57.360" style="s2">and in indo-tibetan buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a series of methods called</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.360" end="00:08:00.720" style="s2">consciousness transfers</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">power the word literally means to shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.720" end="00:08:03.280" style="s2">location</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s the method i&#39;m going to talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">about now</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">these represent lineage traditions and a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:13.680" style="s2">lineage means that there are special</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">instructions and the emphasis on linear</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.680" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">traditions is to focus on the actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">experience of an awakened mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.720" style="s2">shifting from an ordinary mind to awaken</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.720" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re given detailed instructions</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">which are usually kept secret</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">so you don&#39;t intellectualize about them</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">they&#39;re given from master to student</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">from heart to heart</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">they&#39;ll call them special pith</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">instructions they&#39;re given from master</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.120" style="s2">to student from heart heart from</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">generation to generation</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.120" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">and they describe exactly how to look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:41.599" style="s2">the take a certain perspective of you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">sets up your meditation experience so</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.599" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">you can actually have the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">awakening</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">and there are fifth instructions for</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">every level of practice from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">beginning of practice</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">to dismantling the structures of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">mind to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">having the taste of awakening to working</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">through all negative states and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">developing the flourishing positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">states and then these are special</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">centerpiece instructions for</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:05.760" style="s2">full enlightenment so each set of piston</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:06.800" style="s2">structure is like a key that opens up a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.760" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">gateway to a whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.800" end="00:09:14.640" style="s2">level of practice in lineage traditions</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">and the the mindfulness is very popular</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.640" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">in the west</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">and i did outcome studies as a western</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:21.760" style="s2">psychologist on mindfulness for 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">but i think what&#39;s happened is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.760" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">become commercialized is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">forgotten its roots</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">i say that as someone who knows this</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">tradition well i in the 1970s i went to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">burma</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">i had a special visa as western as we</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">only had a week&#39;s long visa but</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">mahasi said i was a great teacher in</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">burma came to the u.s and i did a course</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">with him</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">and i invited him to harvard to give a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:44.720" style="s2">talk on mindfulness meditation and while</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">he was at the after he finished the talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.720" end="00:09:46.959" style="s2">he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">having lunch with him and he said come</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">to burma i said well that&#39;s all good and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">well but i can&#39;t come to permanent</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:53.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re going to get a week&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">visa he said no i get a special visa</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.440" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">view so my visa was</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">as long as i meant it i could stay in</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">the country as soon as i stopped</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:02.079" style="s2">meditating i had to leave</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">so i stayed for about four months and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.079" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">went through all the stages of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">practice with him</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:09.839" style="s2">and including a taste of awakening in</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.839" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">but as it&#39;s got more popular mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">is becoming just a way of becoming aware</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:17.519" style="s2">it&#39;s ordinary awareness so the true</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">people are training the continuity of</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.519" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">ordinary awareness and that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">from awakened awareness</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:25.200" style="s2">and so in lineage traditions the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.079" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.200" end="00:10:28.959" style="s2">awakening we say that awakening is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">confluence of all the teachings</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.959" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t lead to that then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">not doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.240" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">and then you refine the awakening so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">have it all the time in all situations</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">we have the only western neuro circuitry</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">study on awakened mind</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.680" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">power is used as a backup so if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">don&#39;t become buddha during a lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">and you fail at the practices of</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.639" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">the backup plan is that when you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">external power</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:21.120" style="s2">you can leave your consciousness when</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.120" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">leave the body and force it out the body</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">that&#39;s external power now</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:39.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a controversy and a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:41.519" style="s2">about external power</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.839" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">and that is that in the one of the books</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.519" end="00:16:45.199" style="s2">i translated in the bond tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.440" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">called the final stages the practical</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.199" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">guide to the stage of ah</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">which is 14 stages from beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">practice all the way through full</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">enlightenment in 14 lessons and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:56.959" style="s2">quick managed care version of</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.959" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">we translated that but there&#39;s 14</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">sessions in some and there&#39;s 15 sessions</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">another and there&#39;s a debate about</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">whether they should include the poor</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">practice in it</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">and the dominant consensus was that not</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">to include it because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:11.679" style="s2">undermine people&#39;s confidence by giving</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">them poor practice as a backup plan</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.679" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">put the emphasis on having them become</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">fully booted during lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:18.799" style="s2">and then if they don&#39;t do it then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:20.720" style="s2">give the back a plane later in life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.799" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">the external power</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way that the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">usually does it</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.799" style="s2">internal power is how you use the dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:32.000" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.799" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">itself during the actual dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.000" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">process to become a buddha and there are</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:38.400" style="s2">three stages of dying process what first</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">is called the chikibardo</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.400" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">which is literally means the the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:43.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">the dying process itself it literally</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.200" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">means the</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:49.600" style="s2">in the jaws of death while you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">early stages of dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.600" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the best opportunity to become a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">full buddha</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:57.280" style="s2">if not during your lifetime and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">called internal power</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.280" end="00:18:00.799" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t miss it then the second</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:04.240" style="s2">bartow is called the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.799" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">of dhammadatu chernibado</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.240" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">and the third is the bottom of rebirth</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">the first is that when an internal power</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">the first opportunity or three</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:18.160" style="s2">opportunities you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">first opportunity is during the jaws of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.160" end="00:18:21.679" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">so what will happen is that the elements</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:24.320" style="s2">of the body dissolve and</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">the elements that bother to support the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.320" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">mind so all conceptual thought stops</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:31.280" style="s2">all perception stops so if you open your</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">eyes you don&#39;t see anything anymore</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.280" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">you don&#39;t hear anything anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:37.360" style="s2">what&#39;s left is an</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:38.640" style="s2">infinite field of lucid awakened</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.640" end="00:18:41.600" style="s2">if you recognize that for what it is we</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:43.120" style="s2">call that the clear light of the dying</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.600" end="00:18:45.039" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.120" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">during that time when all thoughts and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.039" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">percept ordinary perception stops</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">which would ordinarily serve as</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:51.679" style="s2">distraction to you if you recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">clear lucid</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.679" end="00:18:55.520" style="s2">bright awakened awareness as as awakened</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:58.640" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.520" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">then you become a buddha on the spot so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.640" end="00:19:02.559" style="s2">the best preparation for dying is</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">awakening during the lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.559" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">so you can use what&#39;s called the clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">light of dying to recognize and say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">is familiar</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">i know this that&#39;s called that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">first chance you get if you miss that</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">then there&#39;s a second after death state</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">called the border of dhammadatu</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">and i like to call it the sound and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">light show you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">pairs of lights one&#39;s bright and one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">very bright and the other one&#39;s faint</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">and light</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">and in the background there are sounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">like the continuous sound of thunderclap</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very loud sounds and you can use</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">the sounds and lights</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">to see through them as insubstantial not</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:46.480" style="s2">not as</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">is real real substantial not like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.480" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">reality out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">you have to see it as is just mental</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">constructions the mind is throwing up</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">these metal constructions and if you see</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">them properly as mental constructions</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">and don&#39;t get caught up in them or react</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.320" style="s2">to them then you can use that as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">platform to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.320" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">see beyond those constructions to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">clear light of awaken mind again so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:09.360" style="s2">that&#39;s the second</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">you can use the sound and light show if</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.360" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">you miss that then</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.720" style="s2">what happens is content starts to come</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">back and depending on</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.720" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">the comic influences of your lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to determine which</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">which form of the six realms of</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">and let&#39;s suppose somebody dies of</p>

<p begin="00:24:37.760" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">are four practices that are done</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">to develop what&#39;s called grade</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">the first two are what are called</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:57.679" style="s2">treacher or thoroughly cutting through</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">practices in zochin and the second ones</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.679" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">what are called bypassing</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">we work with four levels of visions</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.799" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">those are the more advanced practices</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">what you do in the first practice is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">once you have a taste of awakening which</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">is an infinitely vast</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:30.000" style="s2">and you operate out of being that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">that&#39;s your basis it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">what you learn to do is</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">when you first have that experience it</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">changes everything it moves your heart</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">you you feel like it&#39;s familiar to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">you recognize that you&#39;re coming home</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:14.640" style="s2">but you&#39;ll probably fall out of that</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.640" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">the ordinary habits of the mind come</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">back so you have to then set up that</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">set up the view that opens up this shift</p>

<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">engaging in activities</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to maintain awakening when</p>

<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">but it&#39;s much harder to you stay in a</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">so i spent a month with him and all he</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.919" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">had to do was</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.440" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">sit outside in his office and he had a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:44.399" style="s2">steady stream of people and i&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">converse with him and maintain awakening</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.399" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">while i was conversing with them and i</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.200" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">and after about a month i could pretty</p>

<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:59.760" style="s2">including in deep sleep and dreams</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">so that&#39;s the after if you hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.760" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">awakening all the time then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">you hold that vast expanse as your view</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.600" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">and you let everything arise within it</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.799" style="s2">and whatever arises within that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:16.159" style="s2">you see as the lively expression of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.799" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">awakened awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.159" end="00:28:19.279" style="s2">so all thoughts become lively awakened</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">awareness all pers</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.279" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">all emotions become lively awakened</p>

<p begin="00:28:29.279" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">and then you hold both views</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">simultaneously the infinite vast expanse</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">and the uninterrupted liveliness of what</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">and you hold it in such a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">don&#39;t engage anything that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">mental engagement in zochin or</p>

<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">so if you hold this view and you let</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:54.159" style="s2">everything arise and you don&#39;t engage</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.159" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">moment by moment by moment by moment it</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">forces the mind to release calming</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">memory traces</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">if you do that after it becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:06.320" style="s2">automatic process you do it 24 7</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">and and after a while after about seven</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.320" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">or eight years there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:10.880" style="s2">negative states left it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">dominator exhaustion you exhaust all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.880" end="00:29:14.720" style="s2">negative states that would otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">comically ripen and since the negative</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.720" end="00:29:17.279" style="s2">states mass</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">positive states you get a flourishing of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.279" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">80 to 85 positive qualities at once</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s the state of mind that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.640" style="s2">live in from there</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.840" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">so that process</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">is what you start with in</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">in when you do great consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:37.360" style="s2">transference very secret power</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">during that if you do that process in in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.360" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">in meditation is during your lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:40.799" style="s2">and you have some the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.799" end="00:29:43.840" style="s2">complete purification in the flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:45.279" style="s2">of positive states what&#39;s called sange</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">in tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">then while you&#39;re dying and you read the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">signs of dying and you know you&#39;re ready</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">to die</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">you enter that same experience of</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:57.679" style="s2">and you intentionally dissolve what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:59.679" style="s2">residual of the physical body</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.679" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">and after three days into the dying</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.679" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">process the body will disappear</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">now it&#39;s said that there&#39;s a subtle</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">particulate matter of the body that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t disappear but as</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">seen by others it will seem like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.240" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">body disappears all that&#39;s left is</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.360" style="s2">the hair and nails the inanimate</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">substance of the body but the bones of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.360" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:19.679" style="s2">body is completely gone it&#39;s all changed</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.480" style="s2">into light and what will float into</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.679" end="00:30:25.679" style="s2">space after three days is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.480" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">a spectacular display of rainbow lights</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.679" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">circling in in in the air and that will</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">last for</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">several days or something several weeks</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">that&#39;s called rainbow body</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:37.600" style="s2">there&#39;s no physical body left the second</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">way of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.600" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">what&#39;s called authority cutting through</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:41.760" style="s2">practice way of doing a rainbow body is</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.760" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">is to use the dakinis which are the</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">female and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">wisdom energy forms and they know this</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">practice well the lineage holder is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">whole little</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">practice so you act as if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:55.919" style="s2">dikini who knows how to do this practice</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">and it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.919" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">you get out of your own way and you you</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">can improve the efficiency of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">dissolving process</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">by imagining that yourself as a key</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">doing this process as you die</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">and then you can get achieve rainbow</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.559" style="s2">light much quicker than say three days</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">you can do it in a single day</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.559" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">that&#39;s the second process the other two</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">processes are what are called</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">um the forest fire approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">and the awareness holders approach the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.840" style="s2">forest fire approach is a bypassing</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">approach to</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.840" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">trigel approach and what you do in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">you imagine that you you when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">dying you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">light the body on fire and it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">residual substantiality of the body is</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">like fuel and it all burns up and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">quickly burns up and disappears</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">and all that&#39;s left is bright light</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">rainbow lights in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">above where the body was that&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">forest fire approach</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">and the fourth approach is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to purify the residual</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:31:59.760" style="s2">substantiality of the body at all</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">because if you take the view that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">the body was never anything other than</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">primarily pure right from the very</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.399" style="s2">beginning this time</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">if you have that extreme experience you</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do anything you can you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:12.080" style="s2">can intend</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.279" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">the body in in this original sacred form</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.080" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">without any substantiality just appears</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:17.919" style="s2">rainbow light in the sky</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">so in the ningmah tradition in tibetan</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.919" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">buddhism for example there was a man</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">named garb dorji who was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">indian master who was the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">tradition and he had two students</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">one was manju shumitra and the other was</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">a man named sri simmo who was probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">the sambhav&#39;s teacher</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.760" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.840" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">so when he was</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">sickly and dying and he said i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.760" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">have to die now he told me</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:53.039" style="s2">he might just shoot me to us with him he</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">said don&#39;t die you haven&#39;t given me all</p>

<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">where there&#39;s more that you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">it feels still unsettled</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">whether there&#39;s something that they want</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:12.720" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">continue that process until it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">something shifts</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:21.839" style="s2">until you start to feel settled</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">now it&#39;s time to take leave</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">find a way of taking leave in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.760" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">you can keep the memories of what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:00.480" style="s2">had it seems so precious</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">but other than that saying goodbye so</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.400" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">you can go your separate ways on your</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">journeys</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.800" end="00:42:17.839" style="s2">find a way of taking leave now</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.800" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">and then imagine yourself now at some</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">time in the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:34.800" style="s2">when you&#39;ve gone on with your life</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">settle with this grief it&#39;s come to an</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.800" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">end and notice what&#39;s different about</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">at that time in the future when you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">settled with this grieving process</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.040" end="00:42:51.440" style="s2">imagine a scene in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">about the ways you&#39;re going about your</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.440" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">life and what&#39;s different about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">and then bring the process to a close</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">i&#39;m going to account for one to five and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:24.839" style="s2">you can awaken yourself feeling settled</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">with your experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.839" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">five four</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">three two one fully awake and settle</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">with your experience</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">now this protocol has several steps in</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:43.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.920" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">the first step is to make a connection</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">person that you&#39;ve lost so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">think about the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:44:00.560" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">and you think about it intimately with</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.560" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">the feelings</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">now many people will feel like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">they can feel that closeness so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">that the person is like present in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">room</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">early in the grieving process 70 of</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">will feel like the person is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">visitation to them</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">the person has just died so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">uncommon</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">you can imagine the connection so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.839" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">vividly it&#39;s like they&#39;re in the room</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.800" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">we call that the revivification part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">it you&#39;re making it vivid</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">then the protocol begins with</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:52.800" style="s2">the invitation to</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">bring to mind what feels most</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.800" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">emotionally unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.240" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">and the instructions are that specific</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">if you focus on what feels most</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:07.599" style="s2">emotionally unfinished and give voice to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:10.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.599" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">it becomes an occasion to finish it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.720" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">to finish the processing of this so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">settles down</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why we were in terms of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">most emotionally unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:22.960" style="s2">and you say they can give voice to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">now if i&#39;m working on this one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.960" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:27.359" style="s2">not like in a group of 60 people</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll ask you to give voice to it out</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">loud so i can monitor the process</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.760" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">sometimes people will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">the circumstances of the dying process</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.560" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">sometimes they&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">the loss of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">but whatever it is that they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">fully</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">have all the information they need in</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:01.520" style="s2">order to process this</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">so giving voice to what&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">emotionally unfinished is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">starting to process that again</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">for example i i was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.359" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">psychology training workshop for three</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:18.160" style="s2">days and i had a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:21.040" style="s2">senior psychologist take it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.160" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">and then this first day she didn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.040" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">back after the first day</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">and she called me two days later and</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">what she told me was that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">she and her husband had some difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">with fertilization but</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">they eventually had a child</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">and they thought it was the only child</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">they had</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">and the child was 16 at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">while she came to this workshop with me</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">she got a call that night from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">police that when he was driving home he</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">crashed his car and burned and he died</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">so and she was suicidal after that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.920" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">this was her only chance to have a kid</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">she put everything into this kid</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:12.960" style="s2">so i told her to come in and we did this</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">grief protocol and she</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.960" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">first went over what</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:22.400" style="s2">was missing from how he died</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">and she thought he might have reached</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.400" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">over as a country road it was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">trees and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">wrapped his car on a tree and it burned</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">she thought he might have been putting</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">in a cd and not paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:36.079" style="s2">road</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">she was meaning making about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.079" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">of the dying</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">but one of the things she gave voice to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">was she said you&#39;re drinking too much</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">and that was true so she understood an</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">explanation for this</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">which was quite plausible</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">but then she wanted to die</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">and she was suicidal</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.240" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">in the second part of the third part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">the protocol the first is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">revivification the second is giving</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:08.559" style="s2">voice to what feels most emotional</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:12.000" style="s2">unfinished and</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.559" end="00:48:13.839" style="s2">she said you can&#39;t leave me i&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.000" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">you&#39;re the only thing i have in my life</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.839" end="00:48:21.760" style="s2">outside of her husband</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:24.640" style="s2">so she gave voice to that concern</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.760" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">in the next part you you let him give</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.640" end="00:48:29.280" style="s2">voice to what he knows about her</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a metaphor for unhooking the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.280" end="00:48:33.760" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">it was freud and his contemporary carl</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.760" end="00:48:37.440" style="s2">abraham who said that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">complicated bereavement is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.440" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">always about conflict in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">and the way you best way you get at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">conflict in this protocol is by</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">getting that person to give voice to</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">what the conflict is</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.240" style="s2">rather than the person giving voice to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:54.720" style="s2">it it comes through the metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.240" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.720" end="00:48:58.480" style="s2">they know the conflict they can see it</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:01.440" style="s2">more better and what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.480" end="00:49:02.480" style="s2">what what he said to her was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.440" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.480" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">ma get a life you&#39;re in my face all the</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">stay alive and give or get a life</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.040" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">now she knew that but the point was that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:22.160" style="s2">he had to say it that vividly</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:27.440" style="s2">and once he could say that more vividly</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.599" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">that resolved the conflict sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.440" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">that she could go on with her life</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:37.040" style="s2">and the conflict got unhooked the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">part of the protocol is</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.040" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">leave taking you can keep the memories</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:45.119" style="s2">you can&#39;t keep the relationship because</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">that&#39;s complicated believe me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.119" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">delaying the believement</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">so it forces the issue of making the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">difference between the memories</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">and the actual saying goodbye and leave</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">taking</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.520" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">and then the last part of the protocol</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">is you imagine some indefinite time in</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">the future when the person has finished</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">the grieving process</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">and they see what their life is like and</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">they can get on with their life again</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.880" style="s2">beyond this grieving process it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">powerful protocol</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.880" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">it was originally developed in 1989 by</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:16.880" style="s2">manthop in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">australia we&#39;ve used it a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.880" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">it rarely ever does not work</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:25.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s very powerful this is the best</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">of what i found in</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.520" end="00:50:28.800" style="s2">grieving in the west</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.880" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">now you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.000" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">cody the pandemic and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.839" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">when we don&#39;t have funerals anymore</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.520" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">because of the social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:46.400" style="s2">and a lot of times people in nursing</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">homes they just pile them in trucks now</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.400" end="00:50:50.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not even a funeral there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:54.640" style="s2">burial service</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s become a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.640" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">cultural problem with almost 200 000</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.440" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:00.400" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.280" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">as a culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s important to address this</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:16.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.119" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">one of the ways of doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.839" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">the persons who&#39;ve died all</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:32.079" style="s2">releasing their indestructible essences</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">and wandering on their journey</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.079" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">and if you put the intention of your own</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">mind into guiding them along the path</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:40.319" style="s2">it will soften their fear</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">a lot of people who die of covet they</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">can&#39;t breathe that&#39;s how they die</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:51.520" style="s2">that&#39;s terrifying you comfort them</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.520" style="s2">you do a visualization for all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.520" end="00:51:55.680" style="s2">people who died of corvette and comfort</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.520" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.680" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">and that intention of your own mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">affects everybody else in the field</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">in tibetan buddhism unlike mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">you open what i&#39;ll call simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">mind you open up a level of mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">ordinary time and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.119" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">the limits of space</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">and in that little infinite timeless</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:23.680" style="s2">boundless field</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">everything is contained within that</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.680" end="00:52:26.480" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">once you open up what we call</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.480" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">simultaneous mind it changes your ethics</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">because you can&#39;t think or do anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have an effect on everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">else in the field</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:41.839" style="s2">that&#39;s where the bodhisattva vowels come</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:43.839" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.839" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">that you recognize that you don&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.839" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">in a vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">and if you want to affect the everybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">in the field particularly those who have</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:54.640" style="s2">died of covid then you intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">soothe them and send them on the journey</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">with less fear</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:03.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a very powerful visualization</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.880" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">which i often do with my students during</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.839" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">this covert time</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">but i wanted to leave a time for</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.160" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">questions and answers i&#39;m presenting you</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">both east and west in terms of how we</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:21.040" style="s2">look at this but</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:22.880" style="s2">i&#39;d like to learn a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.040" end="00:53:24.400" style="s2">about what your own experience was with</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.880" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.400" end="00:53:30.559" style="s2">glee protocol</p>

<p begin="00:54:22.160" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">died like family or friends but</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.559" end="00:54:32.000" style="s2">really stuck with this addiction of</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">playing computer games a lot</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.000" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">and i actually use this as a way to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">grieve letting</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:42.559" style="s2">go of that and it felt to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">just as powerful and intimate and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.559" end="00:54:47.599" style="s2">visceral</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">as i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.599" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">what i would imagine it is it&#39;s an awful</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:53.200" style="s2">application for it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.280" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">yeah which is an observation obviously</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">it&#39;s creative it&#39;s creative thank you</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">for sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:06.559" style="s2">what what what what did the computer</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">games give voice to when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.559" end="00:55:09.119" style="s2">had the computer</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">games give voice to what they said they</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.119" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">weren&#39;t they want to see what they did</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">with the conflict it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:18.480" style="s2">difficult to remember there</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.079" end="00:55:20.880" style="s2">during the intense emotions but the gist</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.480" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">of it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.880" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">uh it&#39;s like you know when you go</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:27.440" style="s2">through tough times</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.119" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">um and it&#39;s always been a comfort you</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.440" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">know comforter</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.040" end="00:55:35.839" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">this idea of not</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.280" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">judging it as a bad thing but just</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">letting it be</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">what it was that comfort</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">and for it to be for me to it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:53.599" style="s2">projection of myself like a mirror of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">myself that i was facing and talking to</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.599" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">and it was like it was saying it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:55:59.599" style="s2">actually preparing me for what comes</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.599" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">and um</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">going forward with the challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">the suffering and the pain that might</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:12.799" style="s2">be ahead and how to deal with it like</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.799" end="00:56:17.839" style="s2">other things it&#39;s honest</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:25.599" style="s2">there&#39;s always what does she have to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.599" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">she had to say um</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.559" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s okay i&#39;m like crying face</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">she had to say that we&#39;re not equipped</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.440" end="00:57:53.040" style="s2">to be a family for each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:56.240" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.040" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">have family it&#39;s just not her</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.240" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">and and that&#39;s that&#39;s acceptable to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">so it shifted yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:07.599" style="s2">as painful as it is it shifted and i i</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.599" end="00:58:12.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve envisioned being</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">some kind of sister archetype to each</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.640" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">other and we&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">so much and it&#39;s just not working</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">um but that&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.720" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">you got to the heart of the matter it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">feels different now doesn&#39;t it even</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:30.319" style="s2">though it&#39;s painful</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">it&#39;s really painful but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.319" end="00:58:36.799" style="s2">insurmountable</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">and uh i&#39;m gonna play with this when my</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.799" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">freaking food addiction comes up again</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">like i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">just right on the verge of like</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">demi-goddess mastery</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just a little awkward finishing</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">touches right now</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">but um i&#39;m into it and i thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">everything you shared today</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.240" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">this is what we hope for it it unhooks</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.200" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:07.359" style="s2">and as painful as it may be it&#39;s shifted</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">anybody else a question from katie do</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:16.160" style="s2">you want to meet yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">ask about comic memory choices sure hi</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.160" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">uh hi daniel thank you this was great</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:22.799" style="s2">um i&#39;m finding myself very intrigued by</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">the phrase karmic memory trace</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.799" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">and i&#39;d love to learn more about that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:29.520" style="s2">like what</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">what are they um how they arise</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.520" end="00:59:37.520" style="s2">and what non-engagement</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">with them means it means you set up the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.520" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">view of this infinite expanse</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">of awakened awareness and everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:48.799" style="s2">arises within that field</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">and as it arises you don&#39;t engage it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.799" end="00:59:52.240" style="s2">you just let it be there in awareness</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.480" end="00:59:57.200" style="s2">when you engage it you form a karmic</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.440" end="00:59:59.839" style="s2">memory choice</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.200" end="01:00:02.559" style="s2">those comic memory traces become part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.839" end="01:00:05.599" style="s2">what&#39;s called the storehouse mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.559" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">and they get activated</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.599" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">and they they once they get activated</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">they the tibetan word is minwa they</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.160" style="s2">ripen</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.760" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">and they come out in the form of</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.160" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">influencing your state of mind and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">content of your mind in subtle ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">more obvious ways and eventually they</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:27.280" style="s2">influence your behavior</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">so most of the content of your mind is</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.280" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">the ripening of comic memory traces</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">all the junk of the mind is the ripening</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:35.680" style="s2">of comic memory traces</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:37.440" style="s2">and you build it up over lifetimes</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.680" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">that&#39;s called a kunchi namsay the</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.440" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">storehouse consciousness in tibetan</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">so these practices allow you to set up</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">a view where you take the infinite vast</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:51.280" style="s2">expanse in the right way</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:53.119" style="s2">let everything arise within it without</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.280" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">engaging anything but with pure</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.119" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">awareness of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t engage it as it comes</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:01.520" style="s2">up it&#39;s like writing on water</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:02.799" style="s2">it immediately disappears and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.520" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">another one comes up</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.799" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">and it becomes an automatic process</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">of release the average time it takes</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">about seven or eight years</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">to do that process if you combine it</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:16.240" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">inner fire practice when you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.240" end="01:01:20.079" style="s2">with the central channel system and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">resolving the substantiality residual</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.079" end="01:01:23.440" style="s2">substantiality of the body</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:26.960" style="s2">you combine it with the what i call the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">turgot bypassing visions</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.960" end="01:01:30.319" style="s2">then you can clean this up in about two</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:32.160" style="s2">years if you do all three of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.319" end="01:01:33.520" style="s2">practices to set</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.160" end="01:01:35.440" style="s2">you can finish everything in about three</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.520" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.440" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">so we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">now of our long-term students we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.480" end="01:01:47.440" style="s2">about 30 students who</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">pretty far along with this process</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.440" end="01:01:51.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re it&#39;s hard to run subjects now</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:53.839" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting for the lab to open again</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.920" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">but we&#39;ve identified the subjects and</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.839" end="01:01:57.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">interviewed them and now when the lab</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">opens judd blue or</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">at brown university we&#39;ll run the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:06.240" style="s2">subjects and we&#39;ll look at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">what neural circuitry of</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.240" end="01:02:09.760" style="s2">the complete purification and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">flourishing of positive states</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.760" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">which i think has profound implications</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.200" end="01:02:16.000" style="s2">for mental health</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">so that&#39;s what it&#39;s a very specific</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.000" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">practice it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:22.319" style="s2">very advanced practice but in these</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:24.799" style="s2">linear traditions the very specific</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.319" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">instructions that are given and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.799" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">done this for 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:29.039" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:33.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve learned them along the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.599" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">that answer your question</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.119" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">yeah yeah sort of i i feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.319" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:44.319" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting point where i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">getting stuck on like engaging with</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.319" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">karmic memory traces versus like</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">engaging with the world</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.720" style="s2">and it seems like it would be possible</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:52.640" style="s2">to be completely unengaged with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.720" end="01:02:54.480" style="s2">world and in like a dark cave somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.640" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">but still engaging with all of your</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.480" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">you know psychological but we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">that in these traditions</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">yeah the true expression of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:04.960" style="s2">authenticity of realization is conduct</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where i&#39;m sort of i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">wondering about like engaging with the</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:14.960" style="s2">from a place of non-engagement with</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">karmic memory traces</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">exactly yeah then you can truly serve</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:21.839" style="s2">because you don&#39;t get in your own way</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.079" end="01:03:28.480" style="s2">but the true measure of</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.760" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">if if people get a taste of awakening</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.480" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">how do we know it&#39;s authentic</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">it may be just purely conceptual we say</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">if it moves your heart</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">is accompanied by gratitude</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:43.280" style="s2">and appreciation then it&#39;s likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.720" end="01:03:46.000" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.280" end="01:03:46.960" style="s2">but the only true test of it is conduct</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.000" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">people who are</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.960" end="01:03:51.760" style="s2">realize they leave a wake of positive</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">influence around them</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.760" end="01:03:55.760" style="s2">it affects their life everything in</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">their life and everybody around him</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.760" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">that&#39;s what we look for in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:00.559" style="s2">genuineness of this practice</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s not like you go off in a cave</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:07.760" style="s2">and do that</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:09.760" style="s2">by yourself it&#39;s not that&#39;s not how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:13.119" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.760" end="01:04:17.920" style="s2">thank you</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:27.200" style="s2">my question uh my family went through a</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.559" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:33.119" style="s2">tragedy in 2019 um</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">due to the various deaths and i for</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.119" end="01:04:36.160" style="s2">geographical reasons i haven&#39;t been able</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:38.160" style="s2">to see them</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.160" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">since that and so i&#39;m wondering if any</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.160" end="01:04:41.039" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:43.039" style="s2">trainings necessary to guide people</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.039" end="01:04:45.359" style="s2">through the grieving protocol</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.039" end="01:04:46.480" style="s2">or if it should be guided specifically</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.359" end="01:04:47.920" style="s2">by a</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.480" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">trained professional it should be done</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.920" end="01:04:50.640" style="s2">by a clinician</p>

<p begin="01:05:36.480" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">much for inviting daniel</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:42.400" style="s2">um oh you spoke of daniel you spoke of</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">three internal poes</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.400" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">uh can you clarify the third one the</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">rebirth one of content</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">well the first one there&#39;s no content</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.720" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just pure field of awareness which</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">we already</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.440" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">follow unconscious in but if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">recognize that</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">as a lucid bright field of awakened</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">awareness then that game over</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">the second one is the sound and light</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:07.760" style="s2">show and you have to see the</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">the lights as insubstantial not not</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.760" end="01:06:11.680" style="s2">as as real and out there and the third</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.680" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">mental content comes back but it starts</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">with the experience of what we call a</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.760" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">mental body</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:24.480" style="s2">that you have your senses back you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">now see people who still part of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.480" end="01:06:27.119" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">you&#39;ve left the world but you can see</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.119" end="01:06:33.280" style="s2">them you can hear them</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.599" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">but they don&#39;t respond to you and</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.280" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">and if you think about going someplace</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">you&#39;re immediately there bush you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">immediately there</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.599" style="s2">so you figure out from that that this</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:45.839" style="s2">mental body has lost the physical body</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.599" end="01:06:47.520" style="s2">and that you infer from that that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.839" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">died</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.520" end="01:06:51.119" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll get a series of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">visions about what world you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">end up in</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">and if you can see those visions as</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:03.520" style="s2">empty constructions of mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:04.799" style="s2">then you can get off the wheel but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.520" end="01:07:06.319" style="s2">tendency is you get caught up in all</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.799" end="01:07:08.319" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.319" end="01:07:09.760" style="s2">and you end up getting reborn again</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.319" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">start starting the whole thing over</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">again like groundhog day</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i was saying</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.240" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">cue how was that</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.839" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:32.799" style="s2">it made sense but</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">groundhog day you know i haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:38.559" style="s2">that movie</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.440" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the classics yeah i figured</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.880" end="01:07:48.960" style="s2">um so how</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:48.960" style="s2">how does one</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.319" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">get out of groundhog day i guess is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.839" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">in tibetan buddhism you see everything</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">is empty which means that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">you see everything as a mental</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:06.880" style="s2">construction of mind</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">we tend to make the world solid</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">we tend to make it as if it&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.160" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s a view that&#39;s reinforced by</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:18.799" style="s2">sciences if there&#39;s a world out there we</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">measure constancies in that world</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.799" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">but buddhism what if that world is just</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:25.120" style="s2">all mental constructions</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:27.679" style="s2">what if we&#39;re seeing is our own mental</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.120" end="01:08:27.679" style="s2">constructions</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.759" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">and that&#39;s the view that&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.880" end="01:08:34.319" style="s2">so if you if you see them as mental</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">constructions you can go beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.319" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">mental constructions</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.600" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">so they don&#39;t interfere</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">but we get caught up in the mental</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.239" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">constructions of our mind we dwell in</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">them we get caught up in them</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:56.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a heart sutra</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:09:01.199" style="s2">it goes like this in sanskrit gate</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.239" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">gate paradigati para samgate bodhis faha</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.199" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s your entire path literally means</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.960" end="01:09:10.799" style="s2">gone gone gone way beyond gone way way</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:12.239" style="s2">beyond ooh what a realization</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.799" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the exact translation from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.239" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">sanskrit this is what it means</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">in our everyday life we get so caught up</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">in thought we spend most of our day</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:22.640" style="s2">caught up in thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">we tend to take thought as real we</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.640" end="01:09:26.000" style="s2">forget it&#39;s mental construction</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.839" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">but if i look at it a certain way i see</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.440" style="s2">the thought as</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:36.880" style="s2">just a mental construction and i start</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.440" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">operating out of not the</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.880" end="01:09:39.440" style="s2">thought i don&#39;t get caught up in it so</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.159" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">much it&#39;s not operating out of the field</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.440" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">of awareness</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:42.880" style="s2">cleanup of thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:48.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the first gote awareness gone</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:50.400" style="s2">beyond thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.000" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">but i get caught up in my sense of self</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:54.800" style="s2">i get caught up in damnedness</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.120" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">a lot of the day i operate out of self</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.800" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:59.600" style="s2">whenever i do emptiness of self i see</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">beyond that itself and i operate under</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.600" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">field awareness it&#39;s not a cleanup of</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">thought but has cleaned up a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:07.440" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:11.520" style="s2">this is second gote awareness itself</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.440" end="01:10:14.560" style="s2">is my basis of operation gone beyond</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.520" end="01:10:15.440" style="s2">personal identity but now i get caught</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.560" end="01:10:17.199" style="s2">up in time</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.440" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">i tend to take the time is real and</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.199" end="01:10:23.199" style="s2">space is real</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:27.120" style="s2">but if i look at it the field is</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.199" end="01:10:28.560" style="s2">a field of timeless limitless boundless</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.120" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.560" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">i go beyond that construction of time</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">now i&#39;m operating out of that timeless</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">field of awareness which is huge</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:39.520" style="s2">and limitless and changeless</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.080" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">but i still tend to localize</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.040" end="01:10:48.000" style="s2">consciousness within that</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">and when i set up the view a certain way</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.000" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">i can shift</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.719" end="01:10:53.520" style="s2">out of that localization and become that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:53.520" style="s2">unbounded wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the point that i open up to</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">awakening</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a big shift so</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:05.120" style="s2">what the mantra means is i get caught up</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:06.960" style="s2">in thought i go beyond thought</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:08.480" style="s2">i get caught up in self i go beyond self</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.960" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">i get caught up in time and space i go</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.480" end="01:11:12.080" style="s2">beyond time and space i get caught up in</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:13.679" style="s2">localization of consciousness i go</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.080" end="01:11:14.960" style="s2">beyond that</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.679" end="01:11:18.239" style="s2">and now i&#39;m operating out of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">limitless huge</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.239" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">boundless field of timeless lucidly</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">bright awakened awareness love</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.159" end="01:11:28.719" style="s2">that&#39;s my true nature i found my way</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.560" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.719" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">so we say that emptiness is the path</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:33.840" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:36.080" style="s2">as long as i see everything is</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.840" end="01:11:39.120" style="s2">substantial and out there</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.080" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t even look at it this way but</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.120" end="01:11:43.199" style="s2">once i open up to viewing it from this</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.880" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.199" end="01:11:46.400" style="s2">i can go beyond all those seemingly</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.880" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">substantial structures of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.400" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">and all the reactivity involved in that</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">and i&#39;m genuinely free</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.920" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">of all that so it&#39;s to find the way out</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.840" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">or if you like the way home</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.600" end="01:12:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what these paths are about thank</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:07.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.960" end="01:12:11.679" style="s2">not so much yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.440" end="01:12:12.800" style="s2">q um maybe time for one or two more um</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.679" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">jacob you have a question you want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.800" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">meet yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:38.000" style="s2">how do you know nobody dies</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.159" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">you have to go through the dying process</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.000" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">and stay</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:45.920" style="s2">awake during it then you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:49.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s experience is your source</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:50.640" style="s2">of what so your experience is your</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.280" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">source</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.640" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:12:59.280" style="s2">thank you then you can come back in any</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.280" end="01:13:01.280" style="s2">form you want</p>

<p begin="01:13:01.280" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.440" end="01:13:06.880" style="s2">because you&#39;re talking about no</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:11.440" style="s2">it makes me angry because this is very</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">misleading and very powerful stuff</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.440" end="01:13:15.199" style="s2">that you&#39;re saying it&#39;s powerfully</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:17.920" style="s2">misleading</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.199" end="01:13:19.520" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about releasing yourself</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.920" end="01:13:22.080" style="s2">from mental constructs but everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.520" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">you just talked about</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.080" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">was constructive</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">so all i can do is struggle without</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.520" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">glaringly hypocritical</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.199" end="01:13:37.600" style="s2">thank you</p>

<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">contrasting ways to see</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.560" end="01:14:09.120" style="s2">dying yeah wondering if</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:12.800" style="s2">the populations in the east</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.120" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">view dying differently as a result</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.800" end="01:14:16.159" style="s2">than those of us in the west like and</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.159" end="01:14:19.199" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">in in in seeing dying in in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.199" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">populations</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.560" end="01:14:26.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know about that all i know is</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.000" end="01:14:29.440" style="s2">the people who practice or how they see</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.840" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">it but whether people who don&#39;t practice</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.440" end="01:14:32.480" style="s2">see it that way i don&#39;t know that</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.400" end="01:15:16.800" style="s2">talking to us this was a great</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.000" end="01:15:19.679" style="s2">presentation i really appreciated it</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:21.280" style="s2">thanks cody for facilitating uh i work</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.679" end="01:15:24.480" style="s2">as a hospice nurse in</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.280" end="01:15:26.719" style="s2">an inpatient setting so</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:27.840" style="s2">i&#39;m around deaf and dying quite a bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.719" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">and wondering</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.840" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">how to maybe incorporate</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">maybe not necessarily the clinical</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:38.719" style="s2">practice but</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:40.880" style="s2">some of the concepts and ideas</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.719" end="01:15:42.000" style="s2">that you&#39;re using to facilitate death</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">and dying in</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.000" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">a better way or a more holistic way</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:49.520" style="s2">here in the west thanks</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.239" end="01:15:53.679" style="s2">well the best preparation for dying is</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.400" end="01:15:56.400" style="s2">the experience of awakening</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.679" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">in practice because then you use the</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.400" end="01:16:02.960" style="s2">dying process to awaken</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:06.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the best practice short of that</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.960" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">then as people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.560" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">still alive and not going through the</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:14.159" style="s2">dying process</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:15.360" style="s2">we can still keep people in a better</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.159" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">state of mind when they go into the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.360" end="01:16:19.679" style="s2">dying process</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:22.719" style="s2">as they dismantle thought and they</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.679" end="01:16:22.719" style="s2">dismantle perception</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:28.080" style="s2">then there are a couple things you want</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.440" end="01:16:29.840" style="s2">to do about that</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.080" end="01:16:31.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a point where in in the western</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.840" end="01:16:34.000" style="s2">literature i&#39;m dying</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.679" end="01:16:35.520" style="s2">where people sort of get it that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.000" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.520" end="01:16:39.679" style="s2">and they want to turn inward that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">point that we often don&#39;t recognize in</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.679" end="01:16:43.600" style="s2">the hospice process you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.800" style="s2">probably what i&#39;m talking about and at</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.600" end="01:16:48.880" style="s2">that point</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.800" end="01:16:50.400" style="s2">families and doctors interfere</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.880" end="01:16:51.920" style="s2">the person wants to just prepare to die</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.400" end="01:16:55.280" style="s2">now they know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.920" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">giving up hope of living</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.280" end="01:16:59.520" style="s2">and we should facilitate helping them</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:02.239" style="s2">die at that point</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.520" end="01:17:04.800" style="s2">and recognize those signs and let the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.239" end="01:17:07.040" style="s2">family members let them go</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.800" end="01:17:09.120" style="s2">but oftentimes we either family members</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.040" end="01:17:09.760" style="s2">will for their own needs will continue</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.120" end="01:17:12.640" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:13.199" style="s2">push the issue or doctors will try and</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.640" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">involve</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.199" end="01:17:18.159" style="s2">them in life-saving things that will</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:20.719" style="s2">interfere with the process</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.159" end="01:17:24.000" style="s2">at that point we should let them go and</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.719" end="01:17:26.960" style="s2">we should prepare them to die</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.000" end="01:17:28.800" style="s2">now how to prepare them to die is to</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.960" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">comfort them</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.800" end="01:17:32.480" style="s2">to remove the fear and uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.920" end="01:17:37.199" style="s2">if you can go through what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.600" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">likely to experience as they</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.199" end="01:17:41.760" style="s2">are in the dying process that&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.000" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">my first route llama in the 1970s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:50.560" style="s2">he did something unusual when he died he</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.560" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">let us be with him</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.560" end="01:17:54.640" style="s2">and he gave us a running commentary on</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:57.280" style="s2">what he was doing</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.640" end="01:17:57.840" style="s2">up to the point he couldn&#39;t talk anymore</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.280" end="01:17:58.880" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.840" end="01:18:00.320" style="s2">before you got to the point of not</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.880" end="01:18:01.360" style="s2">talking anymore he told us what was</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.320" end="01:18:03.840" style="s2">going to come next he gave us all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.360" end="01:18:03.840" style="s2">previews</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.080" end="01:18:08.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s the teacher&#39;s greatest</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.280" end="01:18:12.640" style="s2">teaching is</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.080" end="01:18:16.960" style="s2">to teach others how to die</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.640" end="01:18:16.960" style="s2">so you can do a lot in your hospice work</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.159" end="01:18:30.239" style="s2">so whole world it opens up there</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.679" end="01:18:31.040" style="s2">can i ask a follow-up sure is that all</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.239" end="01:18:34.080" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.040" end="01:18:36.560" style="s2">um i&#39;m just curious if</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.080" end="01:18:38.239" style="s2">how you see the evolution of death and</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.560" end="01:18:42.000" style="s2">dying</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.239" end="01:18:45.120" style="s2">um as as culture changes</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.000" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.120" end="01:18:48.320" style="s2">yeah just the evolution of death and</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:51.120" style="s2">dying in the west</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.320" end="01:18:52.880" style="s2">maybe in relation to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.120" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">teachings</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.880" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.320" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">ahmed baba was the great master</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.040" end="01:19:06.400" style="s2">in buddhism and he wrote texts for the</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:10.560" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.400" end="01:19:12.000" style="s2">what are called secret treasure texts</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.560" end="01:19:14.400" style="s2">one of them was discovered in the 14th</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.000" end="01:19:16.800" style="s2">century was by kavalingpa</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.400" end="01:19:19.520" style="s2">he left it behind about half of them</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.800" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">been discovered</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.520" end="01:19:23.120" style="s2">and that one contained all the teachings</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">on what you know is the tibetan book of</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.120" end="01:19:26.640" style="s2">the dead</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">and what he foresaw is that at times in</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.640" end="01:19:30.080" style="s2">history people get weirded out about</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.080" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">dying and they couldn&#39;t talk about it</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.080" end="01:19:33.360" style="s2">so they needed teachings on it</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.679" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">so that those teachings were made</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.239" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.880" end="01:19:42.640" style="s2">we know what the experience of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:45.840" style="s2">stages of dying are they</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.640" end="01:19:45.840" style="s2">described in great detail</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.920" end="01:19:49.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a manual for how you go through</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.360" end="01:19:50.400" style="s2">the dying process it&#39;s described in</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.600" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.400" end="01:19:53.679" style="s2">each element dissolves into the next</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">element</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.679" end="01:19:57.440" style="s2">but what the experiences are that go</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:19:59.199" style="s2">along with that</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.440" end="01:20:00.560" style="s2">that&#39;s the internal consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.199" end="01:20:04.080" style="s2">transference practice that i</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.560" end="01:20:06.159" style="s2">i i went over</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.080" end="01:20:08.480" style="s2">that&#39;s available in a book called that</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.159" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">we translated called</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.480" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">the self-arising threefold embodiment of</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.120" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a collection of all the advanced</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.639" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">cave and hermitage yogi texts</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:21.040" style="s2">in one one one collection</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.920" end="01:20:25.679" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole detailed description</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.960" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.679" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">how you use the dyeing process</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.880" end="01:20:41.040" style="s2">i think we may have time for just one</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.120" end="01:20:44.320" style="s2">more um</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:47.440" style="s2">vicente to pronounce it right</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.320" end="01:20:48.080" style="s2">yep hi dan thanks thanks for your time</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.440" end="01:20:51.440" style="s2">uh man</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.080" end="01:20:52.639" style="s2">cody and team for organizing um just a</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.440" end="01:20:54.800" style="s2">quick question about</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.639" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">possibly a more detailed uh explanation</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.800" end="01:20:58.400" style="s2">of the consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:00.320" style="s2">transference process so for example</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.400" end="01:21:02.080" style="s2">during the dying process of the 13th</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.320" end="01:21:02.800" style="s2">dalai lama like for example how would</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.080" end="01:21:06.239" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.800" end="01:21:08.560" style="s2">go from point a 13 dalai lama to point b</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.239" end="01:21:10.480" style="s2">like the current dalai lama like which</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.560" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">boa is their intention behind it and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.480" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.120" end="01:21:16.639" style="s2">well the trouble with that is it gets</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.560" end="01:21:20.639" style="s2">politicized but</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.639" end="01:21:24.000" style="s2">um what what will happen is if</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.639" end="01:21:27.440" style="s2">he decides to come back</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.000" end="01:21:30.800" style="s2">he will leave his body enter</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.440" end="01:21:32.560" style="s2">awaken dharmakaya space and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.800" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">put the intention into coming back in a</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.560" end="01:21:35.440" style="s2">certain form</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.840" end="01:21:36.639" style="s2">but a great master can come back in any</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.440" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">form that they want they come back in</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.639" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">multiple forms</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:44.239" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s on what we call gongbong light</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.080" end="01:21:45.840" style="s2">and intention</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.239" end="01:21:47.679" style="s2">so they can make the determination of</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.840" end="01:21:53.120" style="s2">where they want to come back</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.679" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">rahab tulku who was my roommate</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.120" end="01:22:00.080" style="s2">he was the emanation of parmesa</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:22:03.199" style="s2">and he came in the 14th century</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.080" end="01:22:05.040" style="s2">reincarnated every every lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.199" end="01:22:07.280" style="s2">at the same geographic area so he could</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.040" end="01:22:08.639" style="s2">continue to teach them</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">but he said that he&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.639" end="01:22:12.719" style="s2">continue that there he&#39;s going to come</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:15.440" style="s2">back in the west now</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.719" end="01:22:16.639" style="s2">so how he shows up what form he&#39;ll show</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.440" end="01:22:17.520" style="s2">up i don&#39;t know anything about that yet</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.639" end="01:22:21.280" style="s2">because he died</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.520" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">earlier this year so it&#39;s too early yet</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.280" end="01:22:25.840" style="s2">but he&#39;s going to continue in the west</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.360" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">so the process of</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.400" end="01:22:36.560" style="s2">how one selects a great master</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">that&#39;s difficult because it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.560" end="01:22:39.840" style="s2">politically politicized</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.239" end="01:22:47.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you a story about that i</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.600" end="01:22:50.080" style="s2">i met a llama once who</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.040" end="01:22:54.239" style="s2">told me a story of when the</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.080" end="01:22:56.320" style="s2">chinese were going to invade tibet</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.239" end="01:22:58.080" style="s2">the pancha lama who was an adviser to</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.320" end="01:23:00.239" style="s2">the dalai lama</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.080" end="01:23:01.600" style="s2">dalai lama was a teenager at the time</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.239" end="01:23:03.920" style="s2">they said we need to go</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.600" end="01:23:05.440" style="s2">to beijing and talk directly with mao</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.920" end="01:23:07.520" style="s2">and negotiate a peaceful settlement</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.440" end="01:23:10.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.520" end="01:23:13.199" style="s2">reason to have our country destroyed so</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.480" end="01:23:16.400" style="s2">they went on a trip</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.199" end="01:23:17.760" style="s2">and the llama that i know</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.400" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">three days on the trip had a prophetic</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.760" end="01:23:21.520" style="s2">dream that they would be ambushed he</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:24.000" style="s2">told the dalai lama this is a trap</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.520" end="01:23:26.159" style="s2">you have to leave so he disguised him</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.000" end="01:23:27.920" style="s2">and took him back on a donkey</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.159" end="01:23:29.920" style="s2">and the punch and llama went on with the</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.920" end="01:23:32.159" style="s2">journey</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.920" end="01:23:33.840" style="s2">and there was an ambush and he was</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.159" end="01:23:36.400" style="s2">placed in the house of rest in beijing</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.840" end="01:23:39.920" style="s2">for the rest of his life</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.400" end="01:23:40.400" style="s2">he then died and came back as a young</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.920" end="01:23:43.520" style="s2">kid</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.400" end="01:23:45.120" style="s2">in china and both the dalai lama&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.520" end="01:23:46.000" style="s2">tradition and the chinese agreed that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.120" end="01:23:49.199" style="s2">this was the</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.199" end="01:23:55.679" style="s2">and he was educated by the chinese</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:58.400" style="s2">when he was eight years old not</p>

<p begin="01:24:09.600" end="01:24:14.000" style="s2">by the chinese because they</p>
