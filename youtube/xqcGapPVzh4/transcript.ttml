<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">you know from the preface of the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">this is an interesting place to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">you said this book is about the teams of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">people who do the work of embedding new</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">information technologies into our</p>

<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">into something we fairly often talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">about on the show</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">which group of people i work with we</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">call it bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:28.480" style="s2">discourse it really is a plague right</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">and as you also point out in the book</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.480" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a direct quote</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">our most valuable resource possible in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:35.920" style="s2">democracy</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.519" style="s2">is our attention and as a person with</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.920" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">significant background and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.519" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">science i often point out that frankly</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">are our attention and you combine</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">bad faith discourse with hijacking our</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.959" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">and we&#39;re really talking about a plague</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">something that is really undermining our</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:55.599" style="s2">ability to be who we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">yeah and there&#39;s interesting ways the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.599" end="00:02:59.599" style="s2">covet plague has this informational side</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:02.159" style="s2">to it as well i mean it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.599" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">many of us sick and it&#39;s the source of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.159" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">health health misinformation right</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of health and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">health misinformation around covet that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">it&#39;s just confusing people</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">it&#39;s getting people to take risks they</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t normally take and it&#39;s yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the big problem yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">really been quite astounding to me and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">would say that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">what&#39;s been particularly astounding and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.319" style="s2">disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">about the covid misinformation and bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.319" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">faith discourse i don&#39;t know it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:30.319" style="s2">faith discourse or rampant insanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:31.040" style="s2">is that even intelligent well-educated</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.319" end="00:03:32.959" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.040" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">a significant percentage of them seem to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.959" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">be adopting</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">all kinds of seemingly ridiculous ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:40.879" style="s2">it may well be that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">you know the social media phenomenon has</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.879" end="00:03:45.360" style="s2">been doing to our ability to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">has reached some level of criticality</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.360" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">undermining trust in general has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">to the point that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:52.959" style="s2">have no ability to make sense at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:54.000" style="s2">anymore and we&#39;re going to dig into that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.959" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">in some detail</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.000" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">i think an important qualification for</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">our discussion about the book is to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">clear to our audience that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">you&#39;re basically talking pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">only about organized</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:07.120" style="s2">paid disinformation and you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">delve into some of the things we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.120" end="00:04:11.120" style="s2">talked about in the show before which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">the emerging unofficial sector</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">of political discourse some of it in bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">faith you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:21.040" style="s2">4chan 8chan thing meme wars etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">but this is a very important subdomain</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.040" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">of bad faith discourse that which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">organized and paid for by governments</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">political actors lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">etc right and and in a sense both</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">both domains feed off each other right</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">if a campaign can get a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">volunteers to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.360" style="s2">generate a story that that attacks or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">some negative campaigning that attacks a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.360" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">an opponent you know they&#39;ll do subtle</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:47.040" style="s2">things to encourage it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">and formally under the law they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.040" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">supposed to coordinate a campaign</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t coordinate its</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">strategy with those volunteer groups but</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not uncommon for a major candidate</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">friends who do things under the table</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">for them</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">in advance of the same same agenda or</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">the same goal of getting elected</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.919" style="s2">so they the volunteers definitely can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">work in tandem with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.919" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">the paid consultants yeah and also i</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:12.560" style="s2">would say not even the volunteers just</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.560" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">players out on the net one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve explored in the past</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:19.759" style="s2">is how the memetic payloads are often</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">recently got taken down by reddit but is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">amazingly rapidly reappeared as an</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">as much traffic as it had on reddit</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:38.639" style="s2">which is something worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">and then the memes get upregulated on</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">memes and then they get picked up by</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">that is basically not driven by these</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">operatives we&#39;re talking about but is</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">accelerated by them so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">important other part of the architecture</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:01.919" style="s2">which we&#39;re probably not going to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">into in great depth but we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">things like bots can facilitate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">sort of definitional thing before we</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:11.680" style="s2">drop into some more details</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">is again from the preface what connects</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.680" end="00:06:14.000" style="s2">these arguments is that first and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">foremost</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.000" end="00:06:20.080" style="s2">politics is a socio-technical system</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">constituted by both ideology and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.080" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">maybe you could explain a little bit i</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">think that was you did a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">of it in the book about talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">how it&#39;s naive</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:31.840" style="s2">to think of technology as now a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.840" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">completely separate domain it really is</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.840" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">kind of part and parcel of how we do</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:37.759" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:38.720" style="s2">talk a little bit about that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.759" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">it&#39;s about two different platforms uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s about the social system that</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">that includes these campaign lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">or troll farms in russia</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">and there this can be small groups</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:52.560" style="s2">they&#39;re always formal groups right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">job ads and performance bonuses and</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">secretaries and telephones and office</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">this isn&#39;t about lone wolf opera</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">operatives this is about formal</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">and then the other part of the lie</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">machine is the technical the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.240" style="s2">that take content generated by those</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think you can tell the story</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.000" style="s2">of modern politics without some</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">appreciation of the technical side the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.000" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">technical platforms and the uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">the social organization of it all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.199" style="s2">it&#39;s one big complex system and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">global system right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.199" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not just uh not just based within</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">the us it</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">involves political players around the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">that&#39;s probably mostly new at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">inbound into the west is to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:52.319" style="s2">state actors or closely affiliated the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">state actors are taking a role</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.319" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">now to be honest the west has</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">manipulated elections all around the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:59.919" style="s2">world since the 50s so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:01.759" style="s2">it&#39;s turnabout but</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.919" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">you know the relatively low cost and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.759" end="00:08:05.280" style="s2">anonymity that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">networks provide has actually made us</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.280" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">eat some of our own</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:11.199" style="s2">food that we&#39;ve been doing by more brute</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">force methods for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.199" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">surprises that um there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">multiple governments who are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:19.280" style="s2">target</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">voters in the us and canada australia</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.280" end="00:08:23.199" style="s2">and the uk</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">i think for many years russia had some</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.199" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">interest in</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">moving public opinion in the u.s and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">china didn&#39;t seem to have much interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">but in the last two years china china</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">really has started pushing out more</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">more propaganda more messaging more</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">media messaging</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:41.039" style="s2">in english and on social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">that chinese citizens can&#39;t actually use</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.039" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty clearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">what we call computational propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">directed at voters in the west</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">yep and not just china too even iran</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">apparently is in the game right</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure to what degree and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:57.440" style="s2">probably anti-trump</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">but they&#39;re playing too well one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.440" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">interesting things about</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">doing this research is that is is</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">finding how some</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.519" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">governments some regimes are actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:06.959" style="s2">not very good at it</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:09.680" style="s2">very not very good at doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.959" end="00:09:12.800" style="s2">misinformation so i think we&#39;ve caught</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.680" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">organizations in venezuela and iran</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.800" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">india and pakistan they all have little</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.839" end="00:09:19.279" style="s2">iras little internet research agencies</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:22.160" style="s2">that try to copy what</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.279" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">what the russian government set up</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">perhaps around 2012</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">but they don&#39;t tend to have a big impact</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">they tend to mostly be involved with</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">twitter</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">they tend to get caught and exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">you know most of the creativity frankly</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">happens amongst the pr</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">firms in the west or or with the russian</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:44.240" style="s2">russian information operations</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">yeah china too i wouldn&#39;t underestimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.240" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">china i mean they have a lot of skill</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">and they often do blunder at first but</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">they also learn pretty rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">so i suspect that we&#39;ll see china as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:55.880" style="s2">bigfoot in this in the years ahead</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">now let&#39;s talk a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.880" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">differentiates these social media</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.080" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:05.200" style="s2">from at least qualitatively similar</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:07.519" style="s2">forms of targeting in the past i mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.200" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">we&#39;ve always had targeted direct mail i</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.519" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">happen to know richard vigory who was</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">the inventor of modern direct mail back</p>

<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">bought micro targeting information from</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">political machine was essentially fueled</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.279" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">the computers that needed punch used</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:51.360" style="s2">punch cards just to calculate what kinds</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">so if we look at some of the big</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">candidate for office or a lobbyist has</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">enough money they&#39;ll produce a couple of</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">they&#39;ll test them to see which ads play</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.639" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">well they&#39;ll test them to see which ads</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">play well for men which ads play for</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:21.279" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:23.360" style="s2">behavioral researchers tell us that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.279" end="00:12:24.880" style="s2">women respond well to a deep voice and</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:29.279" style="s2">there&#39;s all these other things that have</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">to do with you know frankly skin tone</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.279" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">and look</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:35.120" style="s2">and appearance and age</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">that&#39;ll make it possible to customize an</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">so that you get a message from someone</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">and that kind of narrow casting delivery</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.399" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">is a pretty big difference from</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">from what we used to get uh over tv and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">you know before political campaigning in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">um in the us started playing with direct</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:54.399" style="s2">mail and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">direct mail databases most of the</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">was only ever broadcast around on</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">or during major wars and then it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:04.320" style="s2">mostly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">big governments that would spend big</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.320" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">money on political advertising in</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:09.680" style="s2">significant ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">now it&#39;s incredibly cheap right</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.680" end="00:13:14.240" style="s2">relatively inexpensive</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">to run some ads to buy ads yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.240" end="00:13:17.360" style="s2">to do this a b testing that i was just</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:20.320" style="s2">talking about or</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.360" end="00:13:22.880" style="s2">or to run a basic campaign on social</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.320" end="00:13:24.399" style="s2">media doesn&#39;t cost a lot of money</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.880" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s exciting it&#39;s exciting in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.399" end="00:13:27.839" style="s2">sense that it&#39;s democratizing we all</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">have access to the technology we can all</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.839" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">express ourselves politically</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">and but it means that there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">peripheral voices and extremist voices</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:38.240" style="s2">and sensational content because to get</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">those clicks right to grab somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.240" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">online you need to use potty mouth words</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">lots of exclamation marks and have crazy</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:48.880" style="s2">slightly altered</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">images that&#39;s what makes a modern</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.880" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">campaign</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">grab attention yeah of course it is true</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:56.720" style="s2">that in the richard vigory and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:59.360" style="s2">direct mail world there was a lot of a b</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.720" end="00:14:01.199" style="s2">testing in fact abcd testing typically i</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.360" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">actually ran a business back in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.199" end="00:14:03.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">was principally driven by direct mail</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.920" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">and we did a 16-part test</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">actually and so a b testing itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">isn&#39;t new and i know for sure vigory was</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">but rather it&#39;s the fact that you can go</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">from you know sixteen to two thousand</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:20.320" style="s2">right you can test two thousand ads</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">simultaneously with subtly different</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.320" end="00:14:23.600" style="s2">wording subtly different coloring</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">positioning etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.600" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">and unlike direct mail the cycle time to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:30.320" style="s2">test and learn was about two months that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">was the real problem right</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.320" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">you could only test a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">during an election cycle</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:37.199" style="s2">with internet advertising today it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">literally real time</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.199" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">you can start to down regulate your</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">spend on the ads that aren&#39;t performing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">within minutes and then up regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:45.920" style="s2">ones that are testing</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s actually quite interesting and as</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.920" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">you talk about the democraticization</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">just for fun i went through the process</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">on facebook and qualified to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">political advertiser i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">three months ago i don&#39;t know why i did</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">i just i tell you why because i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.560" end="00:15:02.079" style="s2">getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">some of my facebook ads for my podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.079" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">were getting disapproved i go what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">hell</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">and i&#39;d contacted them and they said</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">well you know this could be interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.360" style="s2">as political even though i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">generally talk about political topics</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.360" end="00:15:15.920" style="s2">per se more scientific</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">or social trends i said all right well</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.920" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">what do i need to do to qualify to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">political advertiser and so they told me</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:22.240" style="s2">and i went through the process it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.639" style="s2">fairly straightforward so now i am a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.240" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">registered facebook political advertiser</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.639" end="00:15:28.240" style="s2">and what kind of questions did they ask</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">the main thing was that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.240" end="00:15:31.519" style="s2">i think this is probably correct at</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:32.959" style="s2">least if you take a free speech</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.519" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">perspective which i do</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.959" end="00:15:36.480" style="s2">which is they basically wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">ratchet up the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.480" end="00:15:40.720" style="s2">my identity to make sure they knew who i</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:42.800" style="s2">actually was so friends i had to send a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.720" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">copy of my driver&#39;s license</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.800" end="00:15:46.959" style="s2">i had to give them a physical address</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">they sent a hard copy</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.959" end="00:15:50.880" style="s2">i think was a postcard or something with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">a code on it which i then had to log</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.880" end="00:15:53.839" style="s2">back in</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">and give that code number so it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.839" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">essentially a ratcheting up of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">quality of my real name identity and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:01.360" style="s2">being able to</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">you know link it firmly with an actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.360" end="00:16:05.279" style="s2">physical address</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.639" style="s2">and so yeah it was a low barrier but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.279" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">was enough to</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.639" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">probably make it more difficult for bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">actors to be able to advertise on</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">facebook and as i understand this is new</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">this did not exist in 2016 but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">something that they have put in place</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:20.000" style="s2">the last</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">couple of years to at least attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.000" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">trim back some of the abuse of their</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">political advertising system</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">right and now that you&#39;ve got permission</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">are you placing more overtly political</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:32.560" style="s2">ads</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:33.839" style="s2">no i have not only occasionally do i</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.560" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">advertise my</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.839" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">podcast turns out it&#39;s not really a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">effective advertising medium for</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:41.199" style="s2">podcasts much better is within podcast</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">apps themselves but i might as we get</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.199" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">closer to the election just for fun i</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">might run some experimental ads and just</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">kind of interested in the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting a lot of the firms in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">countries have decided to stop carrying</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">political ads altogether</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:16:58.800" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s too hard it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">difficult for a firm to</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.800" end="00:17:02.480" style="s2">um monitor who&#39;s a political actor and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">who&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.480" end="00:17:06.640" style="s2">and the reporting requirements um so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">know there&#39;s multiple countries where</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.640" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">facebook and google they&#39;ve just decided</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">to stop taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">political political money for political</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">ads</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:17.120" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">because i do think that it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.120" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">important for political candidates you</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">know candidates running for office</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">to be able to advertise what they stand</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">for and it shouldn&#39;t be just about</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.960" style="s2">raising money they should be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">their ideas out into the public sphere</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.960" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">and i think media has an obligation a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">social obligation</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">to carry some of those ads so i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">i&#39;d rather see facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">take political ads and then do the due</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">diligence to make sure that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">high quality from from real political</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">actors</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:50.720" style="s2">and saying you know things that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">constructive and not hate speech or</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">um you know nasty and destructive for</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">public life</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting that what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">that line right</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:02.080" style="s2">what is the content line and you know i</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">have to admit it&#39;s a free speech</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.080" end="00:18:05.200" style="s2">fairly much fundamentalist i&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.200" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">attempts to you know constrain speech</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:11.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m actually even skeptical of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">hate concept because i&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.760" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">it&#39;s expanding to become a politicized</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">hammer for one side to hit the other you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">know for instance</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll see people referring to good</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">faith commentary about limiting</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">immigration</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">as hate speech or the famous case in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">united states where a very religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">baker refused to bake a cake for a gay</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">marriage</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:37.760" style="s2">you can disagree with his perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:40.480" style="s2">it but it&#39;s not necessarily hate</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.760" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">and so again i&#39;m suspicious of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.480" end="00:18:44.160" style="s2">broad categories like hey i think you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.200" style="s2">got to get much more detailed about</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">behaviors but</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.200" end="00:18:49.440" style="s2">we&#39;ll get into that but before we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:50.559" style="s2">let&#39;s go into a key concept which again</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.440" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">is fairly broad</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.559" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">in your book which is a political lie</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">you define it much more broadly than say</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:00.240" style="s2">the catholic sin</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">of telling a lie and including you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.240" end="00:19:02.400" style="s2">being incendiary et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:05.120" style="s2">give us a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">definition of a political lie</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:10.160" style="s2">well for me a political lies is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">an untruth something that&#39;s patently</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.160" end="00:19:13.760" style="s2">false that&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">in the service of some ideology so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.760" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">an apparent a bald-faced lie that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">got some agenda political agenda behind</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">um and every week we see new examples of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">of what these things look like</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">i think that the real tough thing about</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">studying misinformation over the last</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:30.480" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">has been that the types of</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.480" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">misinformation are getting really really</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">subtle</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">so um just last week one of the big</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">incidents for the for those of us who</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:44.160" style="s2">watch this stuff involved a string</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">of some 20 or 30 fake commentator</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.160" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">profiles</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">who have been successfully filing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">commentary essays with an agency called</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">newsmax and the washington examiner so</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:57.360" style="s2">these are experts</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.320" style="s2">who were talking about the middle east</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.360" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">but they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.320" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">fake personas they had particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">perspectives on particular countries in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">the region</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.360" style="s2">but those news outlets didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">anything to check who these</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.360" end="00:20:11.039" style="s2">these people were and whether they were</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:12.080" style="s2">real or not it turns out they were not</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.039" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.080" end="00:20:17.840" style="s2">so so there&#39;s an example of a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">a very subtle campaign strategy that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.840" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">took a long time to catch</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">that was coordinated and you know lasted</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:26.080" style="s2">for months</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">involved let&#39;s see here involved 19 fake</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.080" end="00:20:30.080" style="s2">personas</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">with 90 opinion pieces and 46</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.080" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">publications over the last over the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:34.880" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">so that some of these operations can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.880" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">quite large</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:40.960" style="s2">lies at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:43.039" style="s2">different ends of the political spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.960" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.039" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">unfortunately the variety of political</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">lies is growing</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">who was behind that did somebody find</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">out this was something reported in the</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.480" style="s2">where the headline is did the virus</p>

<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">from northern italy who would ask the</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">but their media agency asked these</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">well as we talked about earlier the lie</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">of three cycles there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">production stage and it&#39;s the very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">the very first stage where</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">you work out what kinds of messages you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">want to push or who your target is</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">that production stage often involves the</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">and creating a narrative or a long story</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">and making up a long background so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">if somebody searches</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">they might find a little history to the</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.760" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">well as we&#39;ve discussed it&#39;s about</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">it&#39;s about getting a an organic network</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">it usually involves trying to game</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.679" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">social media algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">trying to get them to push a story</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">take advantage of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:53.840" style="s2">maybe how youtube catalogs entries</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">to make sure that if somebody searches</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.840" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">for keywords around your topic</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">your story or you your fake news article</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.200" style="s2">after that dissemination phase there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">sort of a marketing phase where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.200" end="00:28:10.399" style="s2">a separate group of people a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.399" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">who promote the story and carry it over</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">many many months</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">exacerbate it as you said push it down</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">into back into 4chan or 8chan</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">where it can get new energy and get</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">relaunched and sometimes it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">to anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">which stories which fake news stories</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">junk news stories will actually do well</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">in the public sphere and sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">vast majority of the stories</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:36.399" style="s2">die they don&#39;t go very far uh but then</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">you know six months down the road</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.399" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">somebody picks up a nugget of something</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">that was forgotten and runs with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">so this is the sort of aftermarket of um</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:46.720" style="s2">taking stories that have been produced</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:49.679" style="s2">and disseminated</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.720" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">and turning them into a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.679" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">long-term part of a public conversation</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.120" style="s2">so production dissemination and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:56.640" style="s2">marketing</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">yep i think the part that was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.640" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">biggest illumination to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">i should not have been surprised was how</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">the marketing component has now really</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">come to the fore</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">and i suppose it&#39;s frankly not that much</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">different than richard vigory and his</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">direct mail marketing but now apply to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:13.120" style="s2">the affordances</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">that have been enabled by the social</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">they&#39;re a little bit of both i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:29.279" style="s2">that the big ad agencies</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">the big pr firms do have units now that</p>

<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">this kind of tool kit and i remember</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">that do this work tend to be overseas</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">in the book i write about one in poland</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">and another one in brazil</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">were not politicians</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.320" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">and and the example that was given to us</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">the firm would hire 10 000 fake</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">and some of the most innovative work</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">comes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">regular firms that want to push their</p>

<p begin="00:31:43.519" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">but we know a relatively high level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">i see a political ad on tv my first</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">assumption is it&#39;s manipulative horse</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:53.440" style="s2">shit right</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.640" style="s2">but if what appears to be a good faith</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.440" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">conversation between</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.640" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">actual people on a public board we think</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:00.240" style="s2">about that differently could you talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:02.399" style="s2">about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.240" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">yeah and i i like your expression good</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.399" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">faith conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">many of us have faith that the internet</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">is bringing you know for a long first</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">decade maybe the internet brought us</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">mostly truths it brought us access to</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">information we didn&#39;t have before</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">um there were a lot of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:19.519" style="s2">values behind</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">the construction of the internet and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.519" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">lot of reasons to be excited and hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">about the impact of the internet the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">role of the internet in democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">liberation</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:30.960" style="s2">so i think we we tend to trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">information that comes over</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.960" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">digital media more than we trust</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">information that comes over broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:40.159" style="s2">now operationally that means it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">to take advantage of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.159" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">right if you if you can slip something</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">in to the social media</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">social media stream and you can get your</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.519" style="s2">uh you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">somebody&#39;s family members or friends to</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.519" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">forward something without actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">reading it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">then that information comes to us</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">through our networks of family and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.240" style="s2">friends and and we we tend to trust it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">more that&#39;s always one of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.240" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">biases we were hitting and you were</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">hitting at earlier</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:06.960" style="s2">we tend to trust information that comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:09.120" style="s2">from people we already know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">a little bit more than stuff that comes</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.120" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">from people we we</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:15.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know who aren&#39;t like us yep and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">hence the the real deep play for these</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.760" end="00:33:20.159" style="s2">lyme machine people is to you know get</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">things out of circulations that look</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.159" end="00:33:22.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:23.679" style="s2">obvious paid placements or even</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.720" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.679" end="00:33:26.559" style="s2">point of view things like you go to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">breitbart you know it&#39;s right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.559" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">crankery</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.679" style="s2">but if some people start spouting that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">same line themselves it&#39;s likely to slip</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.679" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">in under our discrimination radar to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:37.760" style="s2">quite a good degree</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">yeah in the biz we call it the organic</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.760" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">content it&#39;s the content that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">volunteers from real people</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">maybe it has a typo or a spelling</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:47.440" style="s2">mistake in it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.559" style="s2">it looks it&#39;s not clean copy written by</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.440" end="00:33:50.720" style="s2">a professional</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.559" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">you know professional communications</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.720" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the stuff that we tend to respond</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">more to</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.799" style="s2">and in an interesting way this i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">there&#39;s actually become</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.799" end="00:34:02.399" style="s2">a kind of a different style to russian</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.399" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">propaganda and from chinese state</p>

<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">on this question of style so for example</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.760" end="00:34:13.520" style="s2">most of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">russian profile russian state-backed</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.520" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">profiles that we&#39;ve studied actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">have a long history</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:21.280" style="s2">and they they make posts about flowers</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:22.960" style="s2">and soccer scores and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.280" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">you know soap operas and they they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.960" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">a long what we call legend they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">around for</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">years and then they start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:30.639" style="s2">politics</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">right so they get into your social media</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">networks you don&#39;t really notice them or</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:38.480" style="s2">as plants obviously but then they</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:40.079" style="s2">suddenly start</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.480" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">going on strong for one political</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.079" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">candidate and that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:45.919" style="s2">russian</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">state style of producing misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.919" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">the chinese style government style and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.879" end="00:34:52.159" style="s2">because it&#39;s really just emerged in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">last year and year or two</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.159" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">is a lot more fast and blunt they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">simply buy</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">twenty thousand fake twitter users and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">user accounts will be all numbers and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">they won&#39;t have any pictures</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.480" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">right and they&#39;re they&#39;re create they</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.280" style="s2">were created yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">and then they suddenly they will wake up</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.280" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">and push push a message or echo</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:12.720" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.839" style="s2">the state media broadcaster is so the on</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.720" end="00:35:15.599" style="s2">the one hand you&#39;ve got the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.839" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">style which is by volume</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.599" end="00:35:19.119" style="s2">right huge numbers of fake accounts that</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">most of us would spot</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.119" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">as being fake accounts uh and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">much more subtle</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:25.680" style="s2">long long legend long story line</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:27.280" style="s2">accounts that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.680" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">that the russians have been been</p>

<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:33.040" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and my guess would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.359" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">that per unit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:36.480" style="s2">posting the russian style would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">vastly more effective</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.480" end="00:35:40.480" style="s2">however quantity versus quality one</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">would have to do the research to</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.480" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">determine which is the better overall</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:46.640" style="s2">and the chinese are not stupid so if</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">they continuing to do this</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">it must work at least for some segment</p>

<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">yes that would be a great research</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:54.079" style="s2">question i don&#39;t know which one&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.079" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">i think you know one of the one of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">be some volume threshold if you buy</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">plenty of accounts and set them up</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">you may cross that threshold pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">quickly but i don&#39;t know which um which</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">strategy is actually more effective</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">it all depends on the nature of network</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">propagation you know at the santa fe</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">institute where</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve been involved for many years some</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">of our researchers</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">study propagation on networks and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very very subtle you can simulate</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">it which is kind of fun right you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">make the following assumptions about how</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">the network is connected and how people</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2">pass things along</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">or not and there&#39;s typically a either it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:19.440" style="s2">goes viral or it doesn&#39;t right so called</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">phase change or bifurcation point</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.440" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">and one could imagine either strategy</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">working depending on</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">the nature of the payload and the nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">of the network and how it&#39;s connected</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:30.640" style="s2">and how it filters</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of very interesting problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.640" end="00:37:34.400" style="s2">i suppose today people are just solving</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:35.760" style="s2">it empirically by trying things and see</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.400" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">what works and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.760" end="00:37:38.800" style="s2">tune and tune and tune but if one got to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.800" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">able to actually build predictive models</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.359" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about a little bit later</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">one could in an automated fashion create</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">content specifically to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">of the network propagation attributes</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">easier on twitter because twitter has</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">an open api right a programming</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">interface that lets</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">us pull raw data and with twitter you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">can you can see</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:06.240" style="s2">social networks you can see the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:07.280" style="s2">structure of who&#39;s following and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.240" end="00:38:09.920" style="s2">who&#39;s followed by</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.280" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">you know everybody else and that lets</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.920" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">you see</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:15.359" style="s2">when a a message gets posted who</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">retweets it how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">and what edits are made and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">do that kind of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">over twitter it&#39;s much harder to do over</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">any social other social media platform</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">just because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:27.599" style="s2">you can do it on reddit i&#39;m sorry you</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.480" end="00:38:29.680" style="s2">can do it on reddit</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.599" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">it&#39;s much harder to do on platforms</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.680" end="00:38:32.960" style="s2">other than twitter and reddit</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:35.119" style="s2">they just those platforms just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.960" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">share yeah i did quite a bit of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.119" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">on reddit i don&#39;t know two or three</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">years ago where i sucked down all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">content on the donald</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">and analyzed it in various ways and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">was actually fun</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">and i thought it was a good thing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">that was available i could actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">track memes in their early days of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">getting up regulated and predict what</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">memes might</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">go viral i probably had about a 50</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:55.119" style="s2">percent chance on it which was way</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">better than most people</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.119" end="00:38:59.119" style="s2">so yeah that transparency of data is</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">useful in certain ways but can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.119" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">misused in others</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">now let&#39;s switch directions a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">in your view and you seem to be the man</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">i mean you&#39;re the internet dude at</p>

<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">how critical is the internet these days</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">in electioneering</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">you know i note that trump has hired his</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:16.800" style="s2">2016 social media dude as his campaign</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">interesting thing i couldn&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:24.560" style="s2">his name so i typed into google</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">brexit internet genius and of course it</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.560" end="00:39:28.560" style="s2">came back with dominic cummings</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">and i particularly love was a headline</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">from the guardian that was titled</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.560" style="s2">dominant cummings brilliant eccentric or</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">evil genius well guess what</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.560" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">dominic cummings is now one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">advisors</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">in your view how critical is the</p>

<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">in electioneering and the political</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:53.839" style="s2">everything else well i obviously i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s critical and i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.839" end="00:39:57.280" style="s2">it makes sense to talk about modern</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">politics much without some appreciation</p>

<p begin="00:40:01.920" end="00:40:05.280" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine a modern political</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">candidate winning office</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.280" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">without a sophisticated digital media</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:12.880" style="s2">in a lot of political campaigns now used</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:23.520" style="s2">was the one who ran all the</p>

<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">and today that means having an instagram</p>

<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">tinder strategy if you if you need it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">that&#39;s where you think your voters are</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">interesting yeah i just looked it up</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">because i was curious what the experts</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:02.079" style="s2">think about where the dollars are going</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.760" style="s2">and something on forbes recent</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">guesstimate was that</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.760" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">in the us 2020 elections probably 47</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">percent of the dollars will still go on</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">tv advertising</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s actually more than that so i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">you&#39;re instinctively right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">that the television advertising still is</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">80 or 90 percent of a presidential</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">campaign&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">buys and those are million dollar ad ad</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">buys with very</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">posh very high production value campaign</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">ads</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the bulk of the expenditure i</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:38.880" style="s2">would wonder</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">whether the television ad buys</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">could stand alone without a savvy</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">internet campaign</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">i would also bet that the internet</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">that gives a digital strategist</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">a sense of who&#39;s in which tv ad markets</p>

<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">i totally buy the argument that the bulk</p>

<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:25.520" style="s2">more strategic now</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">and the strategy comes comes from big</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">mostly gets collected over the internet</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.160" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">because</p>

<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">and named the districts where they</p>

<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">case the punchline of this example</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.359" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">is that the computational propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to reach everyone</p>

<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">it drills down into swing states or</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">and you know one percent two percent</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.920" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">makes a difference between who wins</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what makes it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">pernicious too because the</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">the messages that go into those narrow</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.200" style="s2">districts or in particular states</p>

<p begin="00:45:04.640" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">and of course that was true of direct</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">mail also you could micro target your</p>

<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">though it is true that facebook for</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:13.119" style="s2">instance does have an archive of all</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:14.640" style="s2">political messages one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.119" end="00:45:16.319" style="s2">they do tell you when you sign up to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.640" end="00:45:17.760" style="s2">a political advertiser if you run a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.319" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">political ad it&#39;ll end up in their</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">but the reality is only researchers ever</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:25.760" style="s2">take the time to look at that</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">that&#39;s true but there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.760" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">caveats i&#39;d say there facebook only</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">recently made it possible to get access</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">that archive and it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">to get access to the archive so there</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">are hoops to jump for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:42.319" style="s2">not for all researchers and then they</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">only do that for a few countries in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.319" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">around the world i know they do it for</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">the us it&#39;s up and running now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:50.560" style="s2">accessible</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.520" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">we think it includes most political ads</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.560" end="00:45:53.839" style="s2">but if somebody hasn&#39;t gone through the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">process you went through</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.839" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">hasn&#39;t self-declared as a as a political</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">but is putting up political content that</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">content won&#39;t be in the archive</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:05.520" style="s2">and then there are other democracies</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:07.920" style="s2">around the world where um</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:09.599" style="s2">you know elections run and facebook</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.920" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t provide the service</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.599" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">so um i think you know the large</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">technology firms definitely have</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">obligations to serve the voters in the</p>

<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">is that merely a repository of data</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do anybody any good unless</p>

<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">would call out to some investigative</p>

<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">talk about several times is that not</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.720" end="00:47:52.480" style="s2">only is computational propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">used to push ideas and advocate for</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.480" end="00:47:56.800" style="s2">candidates but it&#39;s often used to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">generally disrupt conversations just</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.800" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">increase</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">at all could you talk about that a</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">well what we found from from several</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.760" style="s2">strategies now</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:11.839" style="s2">is that the the goal is rarely to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">one particular person elected especially</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.839" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">if</p>

<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">australians usually the goal</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.240" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">is to confuse people to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">not vote for the most serious candidate</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">right so the russian strategy in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">was much more about taking hillary</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.440" style="s2">clinton down</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">than it was about pushing trump up it</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.440" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">was much more about</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">provoking race and angry race</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:37.599" style="s2">polarizing people on free speech issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.599" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">the goal there is a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:41.920" style="s2">degradation in our ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.920" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">our ability to choose politicians who</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">believe in evidence right</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">if you want to bring down your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.680" style="s2">government one of the best things you</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">can do is make sure they have lousy</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.680" end="00:48:52.000" style="s2">leaders</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">it means they don&#39;t play with evidence</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.000" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t use evidence they don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:56.559" style="s2">sound decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.559" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">existential threat to democracy is</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">with these these kinds of campaigns yep</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:06.240" style="s2">and a group of folks that i work with on</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:07.440" style="s2">the internet we call that the attack on</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.240" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">sense making</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">so in a high quality fashion</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.520" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">and this vast both intentional and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.319" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">unintentional circulation of</p>

<p begin="00:49:36.240" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">may actually be overwhelming our</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just beyond</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">and that if we are going to try to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">sense we probably need to club together</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:54.079" style="s2">into collective sense making in fact we</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">have a little trial</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">alpha on facebook if anyone wants to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">join that&#39;s committed to trying to make</p>

<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">and people post things and we comment</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">upon them and is this bullshit or is it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">etc and i will say even as a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">who&#39;s pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">informed participating in rally point</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:15.119" style="s2">alpha has been</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:17.040" style="s2">a definite upgrade in my own ability to</p>

<p begin="00:50:17.040" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">and you know that may be at least one</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">way for people to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">technologies and data sources frankly</p>

<p begin="00:50:30.480" end="00:50:34.319" style="s2">yeah that that totally makes makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.319" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">to me i think looking around the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.319" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">the countries that seem to have been</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">slightly inoculated</p>

<p begin="00:50:40.160" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">are the countries that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.440" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">a national broadcaster now i don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">that these are countries where the</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">i mean countries where the government</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">the bbc here in the uk or the cbc in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">australia has one too the countries that</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">seem to have that what did you call it</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.200" end="00:51:07.599" style="s2">that club effect</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">high quality professional news sorts out</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">occasionally they make mistakes right</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s always a little bit of bias</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s not nearly as bad as some of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:18.480" style="s2">the other outlets</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.440" end="00:51:21.520" style="s2">that work in modern journalism so</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.480" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">having a public broadcaster figure out</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.520" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">what what</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">the top three issues are that we really</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">need to be talking about right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a vital part turns out that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">vital part of modern democracy</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.280" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">and i think we&#39;ve lost that when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">so many different multi-various</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:36.160" style="s2">sources of information some video some</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.480" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">i think your instinct is right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.920" style="s2">probably too many sources</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">too many low quality or mixed message</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">yeah we have to be able to curate the</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.240" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">trying to identify ways to prevent</p>

<p begin="00:52:31.680" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">time when the library of congress was</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.119" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">the greatest library in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">the british library had data from</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">and everyone could go</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.599" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">research do research and build a</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">business uh come up with a new law</p>

<p begin="00:52:54.640" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">so the basic institutional level change</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">has to be that some of that data gets</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">shared gets anonymized</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:06.079" style="s2">gets distributed sits in the library of</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:06.640" style="s2">congress or sits in the british library</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:08.319" style="s2">so that</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:12.160" style="s2">and faith-based charities</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">now getting there is going to be tough</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">and i think the the first step in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">getting there</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">involves changing who our devices</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.800" style="s2">report to right now when we buy a phone</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">or we put in a smart fridge or</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.800" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">put in some device in our home the data</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">that flows from that device</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:36.000" style="s2">only goes to the owners of the networks</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">and we as users</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">we can&#39;t look at our phone and ask it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:42.079" style="s2">tell us who&#39;s benefiting</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:43.440" style="s2">from our data i think we need a rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.079" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">in the sense that we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.440" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">look at any device we&#39;re putting in our</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:48.000" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">and ask it to tell us who the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">beneficiary</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">of our behavioral data is now once we</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:57.760" style="s2">can get devices to do that simple step</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:59.359" style="s2">who&#39;s who&#39;s benefiting from our data i</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.760" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">think we should be able to add</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">organizations to that list of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">beneficiaries</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">because that way you know i think we</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.559" style="s2">express ourselves civically</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">if i want to support my favorite coffee</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.559" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">or i want to support a particular</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">politician or covid researchers</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:17.440" style="s2">i would happily donate my family&#39;s day</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.520" style="s2">well i would happily donate my data</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.440" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">to medical researchers if i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.520" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">would help with covert research</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">but i don&#39;t have that ability right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:26.480" style="s2">so just</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:28.960" style="s2">getting devices that are accountable and</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.480" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">then having the ability to add actors to</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.960" end="00:54:32.079" style="s2">the list of beneficiaries</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:33.520" style="s2">that&#39;s the big infrastructure change i</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:35.119" style="s2">would like to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.520" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">how do you think that would really work</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.119" end="00:54:38.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean isn&#39;t that just</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:41.040" style="s2">adding more gasoline</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.079" end="00:54:41.599" style="s2">to the wars for disinformation because</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.040" end="00:54:43.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.599" end="00:54:45.200" style="s2">on the left some of them will give that</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.200" end="00:54:49.040" style="s2">or to anarchists or marxist leninist</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.920" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">people on the right will</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">give that data to white supremacists to</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:55.599" style="s2">white nationalists to other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">crackpots</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.599" end="00:54:58.720" style="s2">why do you think that will end up</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">improving discourse rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.720" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">adding gasoline to the fire</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.400" style="s2">well i think it&#39;s maybe my answer by</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:06.799" style="s2">metaphor would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.400" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">it&#39;ll make it a controlled fire in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.799" end="00:55:09.920" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">right now we have no sight of this i</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.920" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can take away facebook</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">right we&#39;re not gonna we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:15.359" style="s2">get rid of instagram we can&#39;t give up</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.359" end="00:55:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna take everybody&#39;s phones</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.799" end="00:55:22.319" style="s2">back we can&#39;t get rid of social media</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.240" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">the best we can hope for is to to</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.319" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">rebuild right do a little rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:27.760" style="s2">and try to change the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.760" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">now if there are white supremacists</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">making use of my behavioral data</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">the behavioral data from my credit cards</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">i want to know</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">and i would end that well i would choose</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">to end that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">right now as citizens you know most</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:44.960" style="s2">people most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:45.839" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t closely police where their data</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.960" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">is going</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.839" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">but if given the chance i would go</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:51.760" style="s2">through the list of beneficiaries and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:52.799" style="s2">would strike some out and i&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.760" end="00:55:54.640" style="s2">add some too</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.799" end="00:55:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s i think the flow of data is</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.640" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">actually now our primary mode of</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.640" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">expressing expressing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:03.119" style="s2">politically we do whatever we vote</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:05.040" style="s2">what every four or five years but every</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.119" end="00:56:07.040" style="s2">day we generate tons of data</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.040" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">that goes off and as people make</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.040" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">political inferences from it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:14.079" style="s2">but we have no control over that process</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a radical idea i&#39;m still i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.079" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">i&#39;m fairly skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.440" end="00:56:18.319" style="s2">one whether it won&#39;t just make the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">problem worse and two if people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.319" end="00:56:20.720" style="s2">willing to do very much with it you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.720" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">both google and facebook have long</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.799" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">your areas of interest and all this sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">of stuff and you can even edit it out</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">right you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">they know for instance that you belong</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.240" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">to a hunting special interest group</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">and you can actually edit that out i</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know one person in a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">who&#39;s ever looked at those ad profiles</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">and maybe one i i&#39;ve looked at them</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">several times just because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">interested in such things but i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:49.520" style="s2">done anything about it right</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">do you really think anyone&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.520" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">take the effort because you know my</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">people most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.319" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t care a lot about this they do</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.720" style="s2">tend to care about these things</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.400" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">in the few days before people vote right</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.720" end="00:57:26.160" style="s2">so in the week leading up to an election</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">that&#39;s when everybody&#39;s mind turns</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.160" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">comes around to you know who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">voting for what&#39;s going on with my data</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">who has my records who has my voter</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.160" end="00:57:37.280" style="s2">registration files</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.920" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">um i think right now even if we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.280" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">we we couldn&#39;t go around to all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:43.440" style="s2">devices</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.359" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">aside from the examples you offered</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.440" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">google and facebook</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">we&#39;d have to do that with every platform</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t have full control</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:51.839" style="s2">we&#39;d have no say in the data they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:52.799" style="s2">already collected and already</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.839" end="00:57:54.960" style="s2">distributed</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.799" end="00:57:56.960" style="s2">and frankly if you try to do what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.960" end="00:57:58.640" style="s2">describing right if you try to to cut</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.960" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">back on your data flows</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.640" end="00:58:02.079" style="s2">you&#39;d get restricted services right</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">gmail wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.079" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">the way the way it should you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:06.400" style="s2">have access</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have the same internet</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.400" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">experience and now the firms will say</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:10.240" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">we need the data if you want that</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.240" end="00:58:14.799" style="s2">internet experience but</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:16.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s so true i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.799" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">a little bit more user control</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">would let us restore that high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:23.920" style="s2">trust that we had 15 20 25 years ago yep</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting problem right</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.920" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">because as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">letting the services have details about</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:32.640" style="s2">our user behavior</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">actually does provide for us benefits in</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.640" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">of the products themselves for instance</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:38.559" style="s2">i use this example</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:39.839" style="s2">because i&#39;m a technologist and still a</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.559" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">computer programmer</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.839" end="00:58:44.880" style="s2">when i type python into a google search</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">it knows i&#39;m talking about the computer</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.880" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">language not the snake</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:50.000" style="s2">right and if i turned off history it</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">would not know that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.000" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">right i have actually experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.839" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">turning history off on google or using</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:59:00.240" style="s2">no history services like duckduckgo</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">much worse experience sorry right i also</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.240" end="00:59:03.920" style="s2">experienced with turning off the zuck</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">algorithm on facebook which you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.920" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">still do</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">even though it&#39;s a pain in the ass and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:11.599" style="s2">it&#39;ll reset it about every 36 hours</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">and guess what the flow of information</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.599" end="00:59:15.920" style="s2">is less interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">and less appropriate than using the zuck</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.920" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">algorithm that&#39;s all about manipulating</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">our behavior</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">however i think there is a place where</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:25.520" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">have the better products without the</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.520" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">misuse of the information</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">at least by paid actors and this is very</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:32.480" style="s2">radical and this is something i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">talked with tristan harris about i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.480" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">he agrees in principle but he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">it&#39;s too radical</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:39.920" style="s2">and that is to ban advertising period</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">for a long time the internet was not</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.920" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">mostly about advertising most products</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:46.799" style="s2">in fact most of the products i built</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:49.520" style="s2">were paid subscription products and</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">today with the low cost of platforms</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.520" end="00:59:53.280" style="s2">those costs could be quite low people</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">don&#39;t probably quite have internalized</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.280" end="00:59:56.559" style="s2">this yet</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:59.280" style="s2">but the total revenue of facebook is</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.559" end="01:00:01.119" style="s2">about two dollars per month per user</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.280" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the revenue and we know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.119" end="01:00:04.079" style="s2">highly profitable</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">we also know a fair amount of their cost</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.079" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">is in their ad infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">so i suspect that one could run a social</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:12.160" style="s2">media platform for a buck or two</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">a month at you know 100 million person</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.160" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">scale almost all the economies of scale</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">are reached by 100 million</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.240" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">so today we could have alternative</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">business model</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.680" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">of very low monthly payments for these</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:25.760" style="s2">big platforms i don&#39;t think anybody</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">would object to paying two dollars a</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">month at least in the united states or</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">in the west a subscription box</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:33.040" style="s2">yes yeah think about this the incentives</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">are suddenly reversed</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.040" end="01:00:37.440" style="s2">in a ad driven model they have every</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:39.280" style="s2">incentive to keep you on</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.440" end="01:00:40.799" style="s2">as long as possible so they get you they</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.280" end="01:00:43.040" style="s2">pull you into arguments</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.799" end="01:00:44.720" style="s2">it up regulates the most controversial</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.040" end="01:00:45.839" style="s2">shit that you&#39;ll send to other people to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.720" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">start more arguments</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.839" end="01:00:49.599" style="s2">so their incentives to keep you on as</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.359" style="s2">long as possible if it&#39;s a subscription</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.599" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">model say two bucks a month</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.359" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">guess what their incentives are exactly</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">reversed they want to provide as much</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:58.559" style="s2">value to you</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">so you&#39;ll stay a subscriber in as short</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.559" end="01:01:01.760" style="s2">a time as possible so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">expend the least amount of their</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.760" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">computational resources</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">so suddenly your values and their values</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.880" style="s2">are in alignment rather than today</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">where you don&#39;t want your attention to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.880" end="01:01:13.119" style="s2">be hijacked but their economic</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">incentives</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.119" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">is to not only hijack it at the micro</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">scale but at the macro scale by</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:21.280" style="s2">circulating inflammatory rhetoric</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:22.559" style="s2">so i continue to believe that is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.280" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">silver bullet</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.559" end="01:01:25.920" style="s2">have our social media but convert it to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">a modest</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.920" end="01:01:30.400" style="s2">monthly subscription fee i think that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:31.839" style="s2">one of the other advantages of the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:33.760" style="s2">monthly subscription model</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.839" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">is that you i think you&#39;d get more</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.760" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">competition</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">you&#39;d get other businesses saying that</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">they could deliver better services</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:41.839" style="s2">or slightly less expensive and you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:43.680" style="s2">yeah you might</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.839" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">might get some diversity in in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.680" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">platforms there</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">absolutely and it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:51.440" style="s2">advertising is now micro targeted but</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">the biggest advertisers still want to</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.440" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">buy in bulk</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">and so it&#39;s easier to convince</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">individuals of a value proposition than</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:01:59.920" style="s2">it is you know they try to get the</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">interest of the unilevers or the procter</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.920" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">and gambles to advertise on one&#39;s little</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">startup platform so</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">i think you hit on it exactly right this</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">would provide an ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">that allowed more competition well this</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">has been an interesting conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:14.480" style="s2">philip i have to say this is an area of</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">huge importance</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.480" end="01:02:18.319" style="s2">for you know all citizens everywhere in</p>
