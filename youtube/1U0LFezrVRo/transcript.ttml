<p begin="00:06:07.550" end="00:06:13.250" style="s2">and he asked me why don&#39;t you water</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.010" end="00:06:23.510" style="s2">explained that America owed everything</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.510" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">nations and then I would rather pledge</p>

<p begin="00:06:30.310" end="00:06:36.590" style="s2">needless to say it wasn&#39;t long before I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.380" end="00:06:40.039" style="s2">left school entirely and I set up a lab</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.590" end="00:06:43.700" style="s2">in my bedroom there I began to learn</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.039" end="00:06:45.590" style="s2">about science and nature I realized then</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.700" end="00:06:48.410" style="s2">that the universe is governed by laws</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.590" end="00:06:51.560" style="s2">and that the human being along with</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.410" end="00:06:57.110" style="s2">society itself was not exempt from these</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.560" end="00:06:59.510" style="s2">laws then came the crash of 1929 which</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.110" end="00:07:00.350" style="s2">began what we now call a Great</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.510" end="00:07:03.110" style="s2">Depression</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.350" end="00:07:05.510" style="s2">I found it difficult to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.110" end="00:07:08.900" style="s2">minions were out of work homeless</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.510" end="00:07:10.140" style="s2">starving while all the factories were</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.900" end="00:07:13.710" style="s2">sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.140" end="00:07:16.200" style="s2">the resources were unchanged it was then</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.710" end="00:07:20.720" style="s2">that I realized that the rules of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.200" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">economic game were inherently invalid</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.720" end="00:07:25.740" style="s2">shortly after came World War two where</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">various nations took turns</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.740" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">systematically destroying each other I</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:34.230" style="s2">later calculated that all the</p>

<p begin="00:07:34.230" end="00:07:43.560" style="s2">on that war could have easily provided</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.470" end="00:07:46.050" style="s2">for every human need on the planet since</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.560" end="00:07:50.610" style="s2">that time I have watched humanity set</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.050" end="00:07:52.710" style="s2">the stage for its own extinction I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.610" end="00:07:55.800" style="s2">watched as a precious finite resources</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.710" end="00:07:58.950" style="s2">are perpetually wasted and destroyed in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.800" end="00:08:01.380" style="s2">the name of profit and FreeMarkets I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.950" end="00:08:03.600" style="s2">have watched the social values of</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.380" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">society be reduced into a base</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">mindless consumption and I have watched</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:16.700" style="s2">as the monetary powers control the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:22.410" style="s2">political structure of supposedly free</p>

<p begin="00:39:33.370" end="00:39:37.960" style="s2">concretely is by recognizing that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:39.550" style="s2">certain human needs we have a view in</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.960" end="00:39:42.580" style="s2">need for companionship and for close</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.870" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">you had get it started with John Locke</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.310" end="00:42:38.820" style="s2">and John Locke introduces property and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:41.970" style="s2">that has three provisos for just private</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.820" end="00:42:44.010" style="s2">right and property and the three</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.970" end="00:42:45.720" style="s2">provisos are that there must be enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.010" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">left over for others and that you must</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.720" end="00:42:50.610" style="s2">not let it spoil and that you most of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2">all must mix your labor with it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.610" end="00:42:55.410" style="s2">this seems justified you mix your labor</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.920" end="00:42:57.510" style="s2">with the world then you&#39;re entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.410" end="00:43:00.780" style="s2">the product and as long as it is enough</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.510" end="00:43:02.250" style="s2">left over for others and as long as it</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.780" end="00:43:04.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t spoil you don&#39;t allow anything</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.250" end="00:43:06.330" style="s2">to go to waste that&#39;s okay well he</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.170" end="00:43:08.370" style="s2">spends a long time of his famous</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.330" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">treatise of government and its since</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.370" end="00:43:13.890" style="s2">been the canonical text for economic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:16.110" style="s2">political and legal understanding is</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.890" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">still better than a classic Texas study</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.110" end="00:43:20.850" style="s2">well what he did is it after he gives</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.680" style="s2">the provisos and you&#39;re almost thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.850" end="00:43:25.290" style="s2">at the time whether you&#39;re for private</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.680" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">property or not he&#39;s given a very very</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.290" end="00:43:30.060" style="s2">good and plausible and powerful defense</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:33.420" style="s2">of private property here well he drops</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.060" end="00:43:35.250" style="s2">him he drops him like that right in one</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.420" end="00:43:37.080" style="s2">sentence he says well once the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.250" end="00:43:40.530" style="s2">introduction of money came in by men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.080" end="00:43:42.180" style="s2">tacit consent then it became and he</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.530" end="00:43:44.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say all the provisos are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.180" end="00:43:48.870" style="s2">canceled their race but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.580" end="00:43:50.190" style="s2">happens so now we have not product in</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.870" end="00:43:54.750" style="s2">your property earned by your own labor</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.190" end="00:43:56.310" style="s2">oh no money buys labor there&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.750" end="00:43:58.380" style="s2">consideration of whether there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.310" end="00:44:00.060" style="s2">left over for others there is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.380" end="00:44:02.010" style="s2">consideration of whether it spoils</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.060" end="00:44:03.960" style="s2">because he says well money&#39;s like silver</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.010" end="00:44:04.950" style="s2">and gold and gold can&#39;t spoil therefore</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.960" end="00:44:07.380" style="s2">money&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.950" end="00:44:09.030" style="s2">be responsible for waste which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.380" end="00:44:11.010" style="s2">ridiculous we&#39;re not talking about money</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.030" end="00:44:13.560" style="s2">and silver we&#39;re talking about what its</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.010" end="00:44:17.910" style="s2">effects are it&#39;s one non sequitur after</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.560" end="00:44:20.970" style="s2">another just the most startling logical</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.910" end="00:44:23.130" style="s2">legerdemain that he gets away with here</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.970" end="00:44:27.960" style="s2">but it fits the interests of capital</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.130" end="00:44:30.390" style="s2">owners then Adam Smith comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.960" end="00:44:32.520" style="s2">what he adds is the religion to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.390" end="00:44:35.609" style="s2">Locke started with God made it all this</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.520" end="00:44:37.859" style="s2">way this is God&#39;s right and now we get</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.609" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">also with Smith coming along he says</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.859" end="00:44:41.220" style="s2">it&#39;s not only God&#39;s I mean he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:43.619" style="s2">saying this but this is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.220" end="00:44:46.140" style="s2">philosophically being principled he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.619" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">saying it&#39;s not only question of private</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.140" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">property that&#39;s all now presupposed is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">given and that there&#39;s money investors</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:54.390" style="s2">that buy labor given that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.220" style="s2">limit to how much they can buy of other</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.220" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">how much inequality that&#39;s all given out</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.470" end="00:45:04.020" style="s2">and so he comes along and what his big</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:07.829" style="s2">idea is and again it&#39;s just introduced</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.020" end="00:45:10.740" style="s2">in parentheses home on puss off you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.829" end="00:45:12.660" style="s2">when people put out goods for sale and</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.740" end="00:45:14.910" style="s2">others you know the supply and other</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.660" end="00:45:18.089" style="s2">people buy them with the demand and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.910" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">forth how do you how do we have supply</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.089" end="00:45:21.780" style="s2">equaling demand or demand equaling</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:23.700" style="s2">supply how can they come into</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.780" end="00:45:26.010" style="s2">equilibrium and that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.700" end="00:45:28.589" style="s2">central notions of economics is how do</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.010" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">they come into equilibrium and he says</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.589" end="00:45:34.619" style="s2">it&#39;s the invisible hand of the market</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:37.349" style="s2">that brings them into equilibrium so now</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.619" end="00:45:40.349" style="s2">we have God is actually imminent he just</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.349" end="00:45:44.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t give the rights to property and</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.349" end="00:45:46.530" style="s2">how you know all its wherewithal and its</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.530" end="00:45:54.569" style="s2">said now we have the system itself as</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.079" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">God in fact Smith says when he talks and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.569" end="00:45:58.619" style="s2">you&#39;ll ever find this quoted you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:45:59.609" style="s2">read the whole the inquiry into the</p>

<p begin="00:45:59.609" end="00:46:05.670" style="s2">he says the scantiness of subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.859" end="00:46:07.250" style="s2">sets limits to the reproduction of the</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.630" end="00:46:19.670" style="s2">so he anticipated evolutionary theory in</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.060" end="00:46:22.220" style="s2">the worst sense I apply if this is well</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.670" end="00:46:24.950" style="s2">before Darwin and so he called them the</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.220" end="00:46:27.260" style="s2">race of laborers so you can see there</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.950" end="00:46:29.480" style="s2">was inherent racism built in here there</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.260" end="00:46:33.220" style="s2">was an inherent acceptance life</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.480" end="00:46:36.860" style="s2">blindness to kill innumerable children</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.220" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">and he thought will last invisible hand</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.860" end="00:46:42.520" style="s2">making supply meet demand and demand</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">meet supply so see what how wise God is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.520" end="00:46:49.630" style="s2">so you can see a lot of the really very</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:53.870" style="s2">on this life destructive eco-genocidal</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.300" end="00:48:51.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s why they say if more goods</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.740" end="00:48:53.450" style="s2">are sold if GDPs rise and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.500" end="00:48:56.780" style="s2">therefore there be more well-being</p>

<p begin="00:48:59.090" end="00:49:03.080" style="s2">well there you see the confusion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.340" end="00:49:04.730" style="s2">talking about money sequences of value</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.080" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">that is all the receipts all the</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.690" end="00:49:20.630" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s a complete conflation of</p>

<p begin="00:49:20.630" end="00:49:25.400" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with a kind of structured</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:31.670" style="s2">deadly as the money sequence decouples</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.280" end="00:49:45.050" style="s2">seems to be fatal in society today you</p>

<p begin="00:49:52.870" end="00:49:58.280" style="s2">rather the measures are presented to us</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.490" end="00:49:59.960" style="s2">through economic abstractions we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.280" end="00:50:02.540" style="s2">the gross domestic product the Consumer</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.640" end="00:50:13.580" style="s2">as to the quality of people&#39;s lives no</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.420" end="00:50:16.270" style="s2">all these measures have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.580" end="00:50:19.190" style="s2">money sequence itself and nothing more</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.270" end="00:50:21.380" style="s2">for example the gross domestic product</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.190" end="00:50:24.050" style="s2">of the country is a measure of the value</p>

<p begin="01:25:12.050" end="01:25:16.560" style="s2">totally simple obvious answer which is</p>

<p begin="01:25:16.560" end="01:25:21.119" style="s2">going to be very productive so health</p>

<p begin="01:25:30.500" end="01:25:35.720" style="s2">later so that&#39;s the direction of</p>

<p begin="01:25:35.720" end="01:25:39.560" style="s2">it&#39;s perfectly obvious where people</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.820" end="01:25:41.720" style="s2">can&#39;t afford to go to the doctor its</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.560" end="01:25:43.070" style="s2">healthcare access it&#39;s got nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.720" end="01:25:45.080" style="s2">with that because you see these same</p>

<p begin="01:25:47.450" end="01:25:52.190" style="s2">okay next simple explanation Oh on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.420" end="01:25:55.580" style="s2">average the poorer you are the more</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.190" end="01:25:57.890" style="s2">likely you are to smoke to drink to all</p>

<p begin="01:30:16.679" end="01:30:21.149" style="s2">hypothetically speaking we discovered an</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.989" end="01:30:22.709" style="s2">exact replica of the planet Earth and</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.149" end="01:30:25.019" style="s2">the only difference between this new</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.709" end="01:30:27.510" style="s2">planet and our current one is that human</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.019" end="01:30:30.269" style="s2">evolution had not occurred it was an</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.510" end="01:30:33.179" style="s2">open palette no countries no cities no</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.269" end="01:30:36.919" style="s2">pollution no Republicans just a pristine</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.179" end="01:30:41.039" style="s2">open environment so what would we do</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.919" end="01:30:42.449" style="s2">well first we need a goal right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.039" end="01:30:45.869" style="s2">safe to say that goal would be to</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.449" end="01:30:47.760" style="s2">survive and not to just survive but to</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.869" end="01:30:51.149" style="s2">do so in an optimized healthy prosperous</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.760" end="01:30:52.709" style="s2">way most people indeed desire to live</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.149" end="01:30:55.739" style="s2">and they would prefer to do so without</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.709" end="01:30:57.269" style="s2">suffering therefore the basis of this</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.739" end="01:30:59.849" style="s2">civilization needs to be as supportive</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.269" end="01:31:02.699" style="s2">and hence sustainable for human life as</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.849" end="01:31:04.579" style="s2">possible taking into account the</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.699" end="01:31:06.869" style="s2">material needs of all the world&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.579" end="01:31:10.109" style="s2">while trying to remove anything that</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.869" end="01:31:12.629" style="s2">could hurt us in the long run that goal</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.109" end="01:31:15.889" style="s2">say maximum sustainability understood</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.629" end="01:31:19.229" style="s2">the next question regards our method</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.889" end="01:31:22.019" style="s2">what kind of approach do we take well</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.229" end="01:31:23.939" style="s2">let&#39;s see last I checked politics was</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.019" end="01:31:26.219" style="s2">the method of social operation on earth</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.939" end="01:31:28.679" style="s2">so what do the doctrines of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.219" end="01:31:29.820" style="s2">Republicans liberals conservatives or</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.679" end="01:31:34.230" style="s2">socialists</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.820" end="01:31:37.440" style="s2">to say about societal design hmm not a</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.230" end="01:31:39.120" style="s2">damn thing okay then what about religion</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.440" end="01:31:42.270" style="s2">surely the Great Creator had to have</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.120" end="01:31:45.810" style="s2">left some blueprints somewhere no</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.270" end="01:31:49.190" style="s2">nothing I can find okay then so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.810" end="01:31:51.390" style="s2">left it appears something called science</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.190" end="01:31:54.060" style="s2">science is unique in that it&#39;s methods</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.390" end="01:31:56.820" style="s2">demand not only that the ideas proposed</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.060" end="01:31:58.860" style="s2">be tested and replicated but everything</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.820" end="01:32:02.250" style="s2">science comes up with is also inherently</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.860" end="01:32:04.770" style="s2">falsifiable in other words unlike</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.250" end="01:32:07.560" style="s2">religion and politics science has no ego</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.770" end="01:32:09.690" style="s2">and everything it suggests accepts the</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.560" end="01:32:12.720" style="s2">possibility of being proven wrong</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.690" end="01:32:15.660" style="s2">eventually it holds on to nothing and</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.720" end="01:32:18.780" style="s2">evolves constantly well that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.660" end="01:32:19.680" style="s2">natural enough to me so then based on</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.780" end="01:32:21.890" style="s2">the current state of scientific</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.680" end="01:32:24.060" style="s2">knowledge in the early 21st century</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.890" end="01:32:25.890" style="s2">along with our goal of maximum</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.060" end="01:32:29.160" style="s2">sustainability for the human population</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.890" end="01:32:31.830" style="s2">how do we begin the actual process of</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.160" end="01:32:34.580" style="s2">construction well the first question to</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.830" end="01:32:37.850" style="s2">ask what do we need to survive the</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.580" end="01:32:40.470" style="s2">answer of course are Planetary Resources</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.850" end="01:32:42.660" style="s2">whether it is the water we drink the</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.470" end="01:32:45.240" style="s2">energy we use the raw materials we</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.660" end="01:32:47.730" style="s2">utilize to create tools and shelter the</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.240" end="01:32:50.700" style="s2">planet hosts an inventory of resources</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.730" end="01:32:54.240" style="s2">many of which are demanded for our</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.700" end="01:32:56.580" style="s2">survival so given that reality it then</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.240" end="01:32:59.610" style="s2">becomes critical to figure out what we</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.580" end="01:33:02.520" style="s2">have and where it is this means we need</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.610" end="01:33:04.800" style="s2">to conduct a survey we simply locate and</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.520" end="01:33:06.660" style="s2">identify every physical resource on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.800" end="01:33:09.510" style="s2">planet we can along with the amount</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.660" end="01:33:11.880" style="s2">available at each location from the</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.510" end="01:33:13.830" style="s2">deposits of copper to the most potent</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.880" end="01:33:15.870" style="s2">locations for wind farms to produce</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.830" end="01:33:18.420" style="s2">energy to the natural fresh water</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.870" end="01:33:20.490" style="s2">Springs to an assessment of the amount</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.420" end="01:33:24.290" style="s2">of fish in the ocean to the most prime</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.490" end="01:33:26.850" style="s2">arable land for food cultivation etc but</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.290" end="01:33:29.010" style="s2">since we humans are going to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.850" end="01:33:31.710" style="s2">consuming these resources over time we</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.010" end="01:33:34.860" style="s2">then realize that not only do we need to</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.710" end="01:33:35.730" style="s2">locate and identify we also need to</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.860" end="01:33:37.620" style="s2">track</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.730" end="01:33:39.930" style="s2">we need to make sure we don&#39;t run out of</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.620" end="01:33:41.820" style="s2">any of this stuff that would be bad and</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.930" end="01:33:43.980" style="s2">this means not only tracking our rates</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.820" end="01:33:47.220" style="s2">of use but the rates of earthly</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.980" end="01:33:50.100" style="s2">regeneration as well such as how long it</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.220" end="01:33:53.460" style="s2">takes for say a tree to grow or a spring</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.100" end="01:33:57.090" style="s2">to replenish this is called dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.460" end="01:33:59.340" style="s2">equilibrium in other words if we use up</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.090" end="01:34:01.980" style="s2">trees faster than they can be grown back</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.340" end="01:34:05.370" style="s2">we have a serious problem for it is</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.980" end="01:34:07.680" style="s2">unsustainable so then how do we track</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.370" end="01:34:09.570" style="s2">this inventory especially when we</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.680" end="01:34:12.270" style="s2">recognize that all of this stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.570" end="01:34:14.190" style="s2">scattered everywhere we have large</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.270" end="01:34:17.040" style="s2">mineral mines in what we call Africa</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.190" end="01:34:19.590" style="s2">energy concentrations in the Middle East</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.040" end="01:34:21.420" style="s2">huge tidal power possibilities on the</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.590" end="01:34:23.400" style="s2">Atlantic coast of North America the</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.420" end="01:34:28.140" style="s2">largest supply of fresh water in Brazil</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.400" end="01:34:31.820" style="s2">etc well once again good old science has</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.140" end="01:34:34.440" style="s2">a suggestion it&#39;s called Systems Theory</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.820" end="01:34:36.330" style="s2">Systems Theory recognizes that the</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.440" end="01:34:39.380" style="s2">fabric of the natural world from human</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.330" end="01:34:41.760" style="s2">biology to the earthly biosphere the</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.380" end="01:34:44.070" style="s2">gravitational pull of the solar system</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.760" end="01:34:48.150" style="s2">itself is one huge synergistically</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.070" end="01:34:49.830" style="s2">connected system fully interlinked just</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.150" end="01:34:51.810" style="s2">as human cells connect to form our</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.830" end="01:34:54.330" style="s2">organs and the organs connect to form</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.810" end="01:34:56.340" style="s2">our bodies and since our bodies cannot</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.330" end="01:34:59.010" style="s2">live without the earthy resources of</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.340" end="01:35:02.210" style="s2">food air and water we are intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.010" end="01:35:05.100" style="s2">connected to the earth and so on</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.210" end="01:35:07.170" style="s2">so as nature suggests we take all of</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.100" end="01:35:10.650" style="s2">this inventory and tracking data and</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.170" end="01:35:13.380" style="s2">create a system to manage it a global</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.650" end="01:35:16.080" style="s2">resource management system in fact to</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.380" end="01:35:18.540" style="s2">account for every relevant resource on</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.080" end="01:35:21.210" style="s2">the planet there is simply no logical</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.540" end="01:35:23.910" style="s2">alternative if our goal as a species is</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.210" end="01:35:27.540" style="s2">survival in the long run we have to keep</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.910" end="01:35:30.240" style="s2">track as a whole that understood we can</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.540" end="01:35:32.640" style="s2">now consider production how do we use</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.240" end="01:35:34.740" style="s2">all this stuff what will our process of</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.640" end="01:35:37.410" style="s2">production be and what do we need to</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.740" end="01:35:39.720" style="s2">consider to make sure it is as optimized</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.410" end="01:35:42.930" style="s2">as possible to maximize our</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.720" end="01:35:44.550" style="s2">sustainability well the first thing that</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.930" end="01:35:46.900" style="s2">jumps right out at us is the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.550" end="01:35:49.840" style="s2">we need to constantly try and preserve</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.900" end="01:35:52.030" style="s2">the planet&#39;s resources are essentially</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.840" end="01:35:56.489" style="s2">finite so it is important that we be</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.030" end="01:35:59.380" style="s2">strategic strategic preservation is key</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.489" end="01:36:01.719" style="s2">the second thing we recognize is that</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.380" end="01:36:04.270" style="s2">some resources are really not as good as</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.719" end="01:36:06.340" style="s2">others in their performance in fact some</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.270" end="01:36:08.530" style="s2">of this stuff when put into use has a</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.340" end="01:36:11.320" style="s2">terrible effect on the environment which</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.530" end="01:36:13.900" style="s2">invariably hinders our own health for</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.320" end="01:36:16.300" style="s2">example oil and fossil fuels no matter</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.900" end="01:36:18.090" style="s2">how you cut it release some pretty</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.300" end="01:36:20.860" style="s2">destructive agents into the environment</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.090" end="01:36:23.050" style="s2">therefore it is critical we do our best</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.860" end="01:36:27.159" style="s2">to use such things only when we really</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.050" end="01:36:31.120" style="s2">have to if at all fortunately for us we</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.159" end="01:36:32.110" style="s2">see a ton of solar wind tidal wave heat</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.120" end="01:36:35.290" style="s2">differential and geothermal</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.110" end="01:36:37.840" style="s2">possibilities for energy production so</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.290" end="01:36:40.600" style="s2">we can strategize objectively about what</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.840" end="01:36:43.120" style="s2">we use and where to avoid what could be</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.600" end="01:36:45.940" style="s2">called negative retroactions&#39; or</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.120" end="01:36:48.400" style="s2">anything that results from production or</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.940" end="01:36:51.640" style="s2">use that damages the environment and</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.400" end="01:36:54.820" style="s2">hence ourselves we will call this</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.640" end="01:36:58.510" style="s2">strategic safety to couple in with our</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.820" end="01:37:00.760" style="s2">strategic preservation but production</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.510" end="01:37:03.190" style="s2">strategies do not stop there we are</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.760" end="01:37:05.110" style="s2">going to need an efficiency strategy for</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.190" end="01:37:08.020" style="s2">the actual mechanics of production</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.110" end="01:37:10.360" style="s2">itself and what we find is that there</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.020" end="01:37:13.630" style="s2">are roughly three specific protocols we</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.360" end="01:37:15.940" style="s2">must adhere to one every good we produce</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.630" end="01:37:16.960" style="s2">must be designed to last as long as</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.940" end="01:37:19.690" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.960" end="01:37:21.489" style="s2">naturally the more things break down the</p>

<p begin="01:39:30.270" end="01:39:34.680" style="s2">strategies make sense here well since we</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.180" end="01:40:20.280" style="s2">also be important to know what goods we</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.340" end="01:40:23.370" style="s2">are transporting and why and this falls</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.280" end="01:40:25.470" style="s2">under the category of demand and demand</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.370" end="01:40:28.260" style="s2">is simply what people need to be healthy</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.470" end="01:40:30.330" style="s2">and to have a high quality of life the</p>

<p begin="01:40:44.430" end="01:40:50.850" style="s2">human and social health overall so very</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.450" end="01:40:52.650" style="s2">simply we take another survey people</p>
<p begin="01:40:50.850" end="01:40:54.870" style="s2">describe their needs demand is assessed</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.650" end="01:40:57.930" style="s2">and production begins based on that</p>

<p begin="01:40:57.930" end="01:41:02.490" style="s2">different goods will naturally fluctuate</p>
