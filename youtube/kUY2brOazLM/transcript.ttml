<p begin="00:03:43.910" end="00:03:47.300" style="s2">actually from within the reading you</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.470" end="00:03:48.830" style="s2">don&#39;t you engage in them and magically</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.300" end="00:03:51.190" style="s2">imaginal e doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t engage</p>

<p begin="00:04:02.600" end="00:04:08.269" style="s2">to live your life in this way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.900" end="00:04:10.160" style="s2">and being comprehensively what would it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.269" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">be like to live this way what would that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.160" end="00:04:14.600" style="s2">perspective of knowing as you&#39;re sort of</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">spective right within that worldview</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:34.270" style="s2">what would be disclosed about the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:37.419" style="s2">and correspondingly what would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.270" end="00:04:40.930" style="s2">demanded from you in order to conform to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.419" end="00:04:45.910" style="s2">that realization so you do that with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.930" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">poetry you repeat the same process with</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.910" end="00:04:51.430" style="s2">the prose and when you&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:54.340" style="s2">prose it&#39;ll happen usually spontaneously</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.430" end="00:04:55.660" style="s2">this is called sin Tamara that what</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.340" end="00:04:57.550" style="s2">happened with the poetry and prose we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.660" end="00:05:01.090" style="s2">talk to each other let them talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.550" end="00:05:03.150" style="s2">other as a way of talking to you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.090" end="00:05:05.889" style="s2">then we&#39;re done express some gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.150" end="00:05:08.139" style="s2">and some resolution that you&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.889" end="00:05:10.870" style="s2">remember and we realize what you have</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.139" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">what has happened to you throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.870" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">reading remember sometimes what comes</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:16.900" style="s2">right isn&#39;t a full-blown insight it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:18.099" style="s2">might be an inkling it might be feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">it might just be a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.099" end="00:05:22.900" style="s2">reorientation there&#39;s a wide continuum</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.780" style="s2">of responses you get from Mexico to view</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.900" end="00:05:28.509" style="s2">now finally recommend that you do let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:31.429" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens for me in fact so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.230" end="00:24:33.950" style="s2">recommend that so one more question this</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.429" end="00:24:35.990" style="s2">is from pleasure of doubt during after</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.950" end="00:24:37.970" style="s2">the meeting Chris&#39;s you said that Alexa</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.990" end="00:24:40.820" style="s2">Davina was to be done as a group in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.970" end="00:24:43.309" style="s2">way you model how should we do it in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.820" end="00:24:46.009" style="s2">group setting and I was on the discord</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.309" end="00:24:46.279" style="s2">server and entering Bret&#39;s question last</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.009" end="00:24:49.070" style="s2">night</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.279" end="00:24:50.570" style="s2">excellent excellent oh my gosh excellent</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.070" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">time on tier sort server I really</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.570" end="00:24:58.100" style="s2">recommend getting involved there so as I</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:25:00.740" style="s2">said there what you want to do then is</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.100" end="00:25:04.370" style="s2">get into a group one person will do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.740" end="00:25:06.830" style="s2">reading and the recitation everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.370" end="00:25:09.529" style="s2">practices first silently to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.830" end="00:25:11.179" style="s2">as they&#39;re doing the recitation has done</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.529" end="00:25:13.009" style="s2">aloud but everybody does the all of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.179" end="00:25:14.629" style="s2">stages individually and then you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.009" end="00:25:17.720" style="s2">something that&#39;s sort of starts to merge</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.629" end="00:25:18.020" style="s2">with the Ilocos everybody indicates what</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.720" end="00:25:19.970" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.020" end="00:25:22.880" style="s2">from it what they resonated from it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.970" end="00:25:24.440" style="s2">then you try to get you know a resonance</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.880" end="00:25:26.750" style="s2">between the various perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.440" end="00:25:28.550" style="s2">takes in the sense of everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.750" end="00:25:31.070" style="s2">trying to afford everybody going deeper</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.550" end="00:25:32.900" style="s2">seeing more from the text opening it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.070" end="00:25:35.630" style="s2">really affording a more comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.900" end="00:25:37.730" style="s2">and expanding field of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.630" end="00:25:38.900" style="s2">and transcendence for everybody so</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.730" end="00:25:40.910" style="s2">that&#39;s how you would practice it</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.900" end="00:25:43.750" style="s2">collectively and it should be practiced</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.910" end="00:25:47.330" style="s2">both individually and collectively</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.750" end="00:25:48.620" style="s2">optimally collectively and what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.330" end="00:25:50.990" style="s2">is you&#39;ll get the optimal experience</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.620" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">usually collectively because I say then</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.990" end="00:25:58.730" style="s2">that the the the Alexio Davina bleeds</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:00.200" style="s2">into a diello ghost and if you want to</p>
