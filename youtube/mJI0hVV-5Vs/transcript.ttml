<p begin="00:00:05.690" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">So I think this part of the course is always<br />a part I have difficulty with, because the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:15.119" style="s2">conceptual transformation is very, very large.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.119" end="00:00:22.130" style="s2">Because so far we’ve been talking about,<br />I would say, biological and evolutionary realities,</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.130" end="00:00:25.040" style="s2">in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.040" end="00:00:27.620" style="s2">And we’ve been doing that in a relatively<br />standard manner.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.620" end="00:00:33.300" style="s2">I mean, there are elements of Piagetian theory<br />that run through it, there are elements of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.300" end="00:00:39.399" style="s2">cybernetic theory, there are elements of neurobiology<br />and neuropsychology.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.399" end="00:00:49.030" style="s2">And none of it, I would say in some sense,<br />is radically outside the way these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.030" end="00:01:05.479" style="s2">problems might be discussed in a typical scientific<br />or social scientific manner.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.479" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">Except for maybe the fact that we’ve drawn<br />an explicit distinction between the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:19.050" style="s2">as a place of things and the world as a place<br />of action.</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.050" end="00:01:23.460" style="s2">Now there are consequences to the idea that<br />the world is a place of action that start</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.460" end="00:01:27.210" style="s2">to become more radical at this point.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.210" end="00:01:32.800" style="s2">But drawing the relationship between what<br />I’ve already talked to you about and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.800" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">narrative domains that we’re going to explore<br />now, requires a… like a radical shift in</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:44.100" style="s2">conceptual focus.</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.100" end="00:01:49.160" style="s2">And so, the way I’m going to handle that<br />is by hitting it from ten or eleven different</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.160" end="00:01:56.020" style="s2">directions, and building up a pattern.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.020" end="00:01:59.420" style="s2">You know, if you listen to a complex piece<br />of music, or at least this is my experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.420" end="00:02:03.770" style="s2">with complex music, is sometimes, the first<br />time I hear it, I don’t really like it,</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.770" end="00:02:06.409" style="s2">and I think I also don’t understand it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.409" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">I actually can’t hear it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:11.080" style="s2">You know, maybe a musical genius could hear<br />the whole thing instantly.</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.080" end="00:02:18.410" style="s2">You know, they say Franz Liszt could sight-read<br />anything on the piano first try.</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.410" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">So, you know, some people are so intelligent<br />musically that it’s incomprehensible, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">I’m sure they hear things just fine the<br />first time they hear them.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">But then what happens for me is that if I<br />listen to it a couple more times or pieces</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">or chunks of it, they start to fall into place<br />that I can follow, and, you know, I can see</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:36.819" style="s2">the beauty sort of shine through those.</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.819" end="00:02:42.051" style="s2">And then eventually, the whole thing links<br />together, and then I can listen to it, especially</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.051" end="00:02:46.420" style="s2">if it’s a complex piece of music, many,<br />many, many times.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.420" end="00:02:50.290" style="s2">And the more complex, and probably the better,<br />the piece of music, the more I can listen</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.290" end="00:02:51.290" style="s2">to it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.290" end="00:02:56.100" style="s2">But if I listen to it enough, at some point<br />then I’ve had enough of it, and it’s all</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.100" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">a very strange phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.600" end="00:03:01.830" style="s2">Because one of the things you might ask yourself<br />is, what exactly are you learning while you’re</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.830" end="00:03:02.830" style="s2">doing that?</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.830" end="00:03:10.020" style="s2">You know, it seems like you want the music<br />to be just exactly the right amount of predictable</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.020" end="00:03:11.020" style="s2">and unpredictable.</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.020" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">If it’s too unpredictable then you can’t<br />understand it and if it’s too predictable</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">it’s boring, and so it’s just like a conversation<br />that way.</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:19.180" style="s2">It’s actually just like life as well!</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:24.160" style="s2">You know, because you want things to be predictable<br />and stable, and you want things to be unpredictable</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.160" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">and interesting, and the degree to which you<br />want each of those is going to depend on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">time and the context and also on your own<br />intelligence and temperament.</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:44.320" style="s2">Now, I’m going to tell you a bunch of stories<br />and give you a number of pieces of information,</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.320" end="00:03:47.470" style="s2">and hopefully they’ll click together.</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.470" end="00:03:52.030" style="s2">Now I think the reason this information has<br />always been transmitted in story and image</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.030" end="00:03:57.489" style="s2">form is because it’s very, very difficult<br />to transform it into articulated, like into</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.489" end="00:03:58.849" style="s2">fully articulated explanation.</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.849" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">It isn’t really how it works.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">You know, we’re not really accustomed to<br />thinking about the idea that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">forms of information (that are valid forms<br />of information) that can’t be transmitted</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">verbally.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">But of course, if you think about it, we all<br />understand this deeply.</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:17.049" style="s2">Well, I can give you a bunch of examples.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.049" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">The first example is that when you speak,<br />not only do you speak in words and phrases</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">and sentences and paragraphs, but you also<br />speak melodically.</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:31.570" style="s2">And in fact, part of the reason that you can<br />understand melodies and that they make sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.570" end="00:04:39.139" style="s2">to you is that what artists have done is separated<br />the melodic elements of speech from the semantic</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.139" end="00:04:41.730" style="s2">element, and then played with the melodic<br />element.</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.730" end="00:04:46.030" style="s2">And the melodic element tends to carry a lot<br />of emotion and intent.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.030" end="00:04:51.810" style="s2">And so, if you’re listening to someone speak,<br />you can tell when they’re being ironic,</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.810" end="00:04:55.320" style="s2">you know, because they raise an eyebrow, and<br />their voice changes slightly, even though</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.320" end="00:04:58.510" style="s2">they might be using, in fact they are using,<br />exactly the same words.</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.510" end="00:05:03.630" style="s2">And in fact someone who’s very good at being<br />witty or ironic will set the situation up</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.630" end="00:05:08.680" style="s2">so that you can barely tell that they’re<br />joking, and the better they are at that, the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.680" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">tinier the hint they give you that you can<br />still catch on to, the funnier the situation</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:15.220" style="s2">is.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.220" end="00:05:19.140" style="s2">So we know that information can be transmitted<br />through non-verbal channels.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.140" end="00:05:22.130" style="s2">It even happens during speech.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.130" end="00:05:30.810" style="s2">And then, of course, we understand that music<br />presents to us an intimation of meaning that’s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.810" end="00:05:33.330" style="s2">very difficult to fully grasp.</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.330" end="00:05:40.530" style="s2">And music for me has always been an ineffable<br />phenomenon in some sense because it carries</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.530" end="00:05:45.690" style="s2">the intimation of meaning in a manner that<br />can’t be rationally dismissed, or that people</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.690" end="00:05:48.910" style="s2">aren’t interested in rationally dismissing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.910" end="00:05:55.620" style="s2">Even punk rock nihilists listen to punk rock<br />nihilistic music, and they find that meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.620" end="00:05:57.810" style="s2">even though they don’t believe in meaning!</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.810" end="00:06:02.169" style="s2">And you know, in some sense they’re victims<br />of their own rationality, because they do</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.169" end="00:06:04.740" style="s2">believe in meaning (or else they wouldn’t<br />be listening to the music), but they can’t</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.740" end="00:06:09.729" style="s2">understand how they could possibly believe<br />in it, so their rational mind has dispensed</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.729" end="00:06:10.729" style="s2">with the idea.</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.729" end="00:06:15.110" style="s2">And sometimes people dispense with the idea<br />of meaning, for lots of reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.110" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">Partly because it’s inevitable, in some<br />sense, with sufficient rationality, but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:26.680" style="s2">because it’s always useful to look for the<br />underbelly of things, because it also justifies</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.680" end="00:06:29.830" style="s2">not bearing any responsibility for your life.</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.830" end="00:06:36.610" style="s2">And that’s fairly… that can be a very<br />desirable side-effect of the particular ideological</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.610" end="00:06:37.830" style="s2">rational belief.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.830" end="00:06:42.980" style="s2">And then there’s dance, of course, and dance<br />is even more ineffable than music, although</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.980" end="00:06:47.810" style="s2">it’s often paired with music, you know,<br />and it grips people.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.810" end="00:06:53.100" style="s2">If you see a remarkable dance performance,<br />well part of it is that you’re sort of thrilled</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.100" end="00:06:56.830" style="s2">and excited about seeing just exactly what<br />the human form can do.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.830" end="00:07:03.730" style="s2">Perhaps, partly, because you’re human and<br />when you see someone extending a certain ability</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.730" end="00:07:09.669" style="s2">far beyond the norm then it expands your sense<br />of what a human being is capable of, so there’s</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.669" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">that, there’s the pure skill element.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.750" end="00:07:17.400" style="s2">And then there’s the novelty element, because<br />often if you watch a particularly good dancer</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.400" end="00:07:20.520" style="s2">there’s things they do that you haven’t<br />seen before that you didn’t know anyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.520" end="00:07:22.450" style="s2">could do and that’s pretty fun.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.450" end="00:07:27.919" style="s2">And then often the dance is joined with the<br />music and the body is expressing what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.919" end="00:07:31.760" style="s2">music means and even though you can’t tell<br />what the music means you can tell that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.760" end="00:07:33.530" style="s2">dance is expressing it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.530" end="00:07:39.380" style="s2">See I think what happens there is that music<br />represents the patterns of being.</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.380" end="00:07:43.139" style="s2">It’s actually because people think of music<br />as a non-representational art, but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.139" end="00:07:47.070" style="s2">that’s wrong, I think it might be the most<br />representational art.</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.070" end="00:07:54.650" style="s2">Being is made up of layers of patterns constantly<br />interacting, and hopefully in a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.650" end="00:08:01.630" style="s2">harmonious way, and music demonstrates that,<br />mimics it in some sense, abstractly.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.630" end="00:08:04.750" style="s2">And then the dance is an abstract representation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.750" end="00:08:09.030" style="s2">People adapt to the patterns of being and<br />the dancer adapts to the pattern of music,</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.030" end="00:08:16.410" style="s2">and so it’s symbolic, it’s an embodied<br />display of the place of the person in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.410" end="00:08:17.410" style="s2">cosmos.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.410" end="00:08:21.380" style="s2">And you could also make that case when you<br />see people dancing in pairs, because you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.380" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">dance alone or you could dance in pairs, and<br />that’s basically standard human adaptation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:32.870" style="s2">And music is interesting too because one of<br />the things you’ll notice is that there’s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.870" end="00:08:35.409" style="s2">always music in a movie.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.409" end="00:08:36.409" style="s2">Almost always.</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.409" end="00:08:39.719" style="s2">There’s the odd movie that doesn’t have<br />it but it’s quite marked when it’s absent,</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.719" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">you know.</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:44.210" style="s2">The movie feels a lot more cold and clinical,<br />although it can work.</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.210" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">But we accept the idea that music can be used<br />to fill in the missing context in a movie</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:51.400" style="s2">without even ever questioning it, right?</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.400" end="00:08:57.020" style="s2">Like, it’s very strange if you think about<br />it, that you go to a movie that is doing…</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.020" end="00:09:02.180" style="s2">at least part of its function is to portray<br />reality in a realistic way, but there’s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.180" end="00:09:04.260" style="s2">a soundtrack playing in the background all<br />the time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.260" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">You know it’s so useful and so appropriate<br />that you don’t notice how strange it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:13.730" style="s2">that that’s okay.</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.730" end="00:09:20.510" style="s2">So, my point is that we well, and then of<br />course you can talk about novels and plays</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.510" end="00:09:26.420" style="s2">the same way, because there’s a lot more<br />to a novel than the words themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.420" end="00:09:34.610" style="s2">There’s you know, a novel is a deeply layered<br />thing, and part of your understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.610" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">novel is your understanding of the interrelationships<br />between the layers, especially if it’s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:39.899" style="s2">profound novel.</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.899" end="00:09:45.890" style="s2">I mean I think that’s why we have this sense<br />of depth in artistic and literary works.</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.890" end="00:09:51.830" style="s2">If the work is deep then it has many, many<br />layers, and the more layers it has interacting</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.830" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">at the same time, the more it’s a useful<br />representation of the essential elements of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:09:59.740" style="s2">being, and so the more meaningful it is to<br />us.</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.740" end="00:10:06.980" style="s2">So, that’s all to say that there are modes<br />of communication that provide us with information</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.980" end="00:10:13.480" style="s2">that we can’t articulate but that we still<br />act as if that information is valid.</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.480" end="00:10:18.940" style="s2">And you might say, well, valid for what, what<br />exactly is it doing, what is it representing,</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.940" end="00:10:23.170" style="s2">what kind of information is it offering that’s<br />so compelling?</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.170" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">And what’s so interesting about it is the<br />kind of information that we’re talking,</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:32.760" style="s2">that information is so compelling, that you’ll<br />pay to expose yourself to it.</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.760" end="00:10:36.740" style="s2">You know, it’s a rare lecture that you go<br />to and have to pay for the lecture itself.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.740" end="00:10:40.540" style="s2">I mean, you’ll come to the university and<br />you’ll get your degree, but if you had your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.540" end="00:10:46.070" style="s2">option on a Saturday afternoon, or a Saturday<br />night, let’s say, it’s relatively unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.070" end="00:10:49.290" style="s2">that you would attend a lecture, and certainly<br />even more than unlikely that you would pay</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.290" end="00:10:54.100" style="s2">to attend one, but you’ll certainly pay<br />to go somewhere to dance to music.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.100" end="00:10:57.750" style="s2">And, you know, why that is, is not obvious.</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.750" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">You say, well it’s entertaining.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:03.519" style="s2">It’s like, yeah it’s entertaining alright<br />but it’s a lot more than that, and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.519" end="00:11:07.941" style="s2">that dismissing things that are enjoyable<br />as entertainment, which means that they’re</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.941" end="00:11:14.690" style="s2">sort of peripheral, they’re unimportant<br />in some sense is a real, it’s a real terrible</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.690" end="00:11:16.310" style="s2">habit of psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.310" end="00:11:23.209" style="s2">So for example, when Steven Pinker wrote his<br />book… it’s a book on language and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.209" end="00:11:28.110" style="s2">I can’t remember its name at the moment…<br />he devoted one chapter at the end basically,</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.110" end="00:11:33.959" style="s2">to non-verbal cultural forms and he talked<br />about them as epiphenomenal, fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.959" end="00:11:38.080" style="s2">You know, they’re just a by-product.</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.080" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">And I think that’s deeply wrong, I think<br />that our culture actually grew out of dance</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:54.470" style="s2">and drama and music, and science came way,<br />way later than that.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.470" end="00:11:56.740" style="s2">I was watching an old video today.</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.740" end="00:12:03.019" style="s2">It was of The Animals playing House of the<br />Rising Sun in 1964.</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.019" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">It’s a pretty good video, and it’s a great<br />old song.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:09.720" style="s2">I mean, they didn’t write it, it’s an<br />old blues song, but it’s a great old song</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.720" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">and they do a pretty good job of it.</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:16.019" style="s2">And the audience was full of girls and they<br />were screaming madly away.</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.019" end="00:12:20.279" style="s2">Now it wasn’t quite as bad as The Beatles,<br />which was completely unbelievable, but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.279" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">was still, you know, a fairly continual din<br />of delighted shrieks.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:30.529" style="s2">And, you know, I think that’s extremely<br />interesting because you’d never see that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.529" end="00:12:32.680" style="s2">at a scientific conference [students’ laughter].</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.680" end="00:12:34.510" style="s2">Well, it’s strange, eh?</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.510" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">Like, there isn’t anything else that elicits<br />that kind of response.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:48.180" style="s2">Maybe sports to some minimal degree, but certainly<br />with nowhere near the same amount of enthusiasm.</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.180" end="00:12:51.700" style="s2">And you know, I mean, that’s been happening<br />for a long time, it wasn’t merely a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.700" end="00:12:52.790" style="s2">of the 60s.</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.790" end="00:12:57.089" style="s2">I mean, I suspect it’s been happening ever<br />since there’s been wandering minstrels,</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.089" end="00:12:58.950" style="s2">and that’s a very, very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.950" end="00:13:04.490" style="s2">And I suspect that those wandering minstrels<br />left many offspring behind them [laughter].</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.490" end="00:13:09.079" style="s2">And well, what’s interesting about that<br />is, obviously part of the reason that human</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.079" end="00:13:12.290" style="s2">beings can sing is because we’ve selected<br />each other for that ability, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.290" end="00:13:17.339" style="s2">I mean there’s something very attractive<br />about someone who’s artistically gifted.</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.339" end="00:13:27.300" style="s2">And the idea that women will do backflips<br />for a singer is not necessarily any negative</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.300" end="00:13:34.850" style="s2">comment on their ability to evaluate what’s<br />important, it might be quite the reverse.</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.850" end="00:13:38.149" style="s2">So anyways, the point is that there’s lots<br />of different ways that we can communicate</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.149" end="00:13:39.149" style="s2">information.</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.149" end="00:13:42.680" style="s2">And you might say well it’s only simple<br />information that can be conveyed that way,</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.680" end="00:13:48.570" style="s2">and you have to convey the complex information<br />in more formal forms, scientific and philosophical,</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.570" end="00:13:50.970" style="s2">but I think that’s exactly backwards.</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.970" end="00:13:56.620" style="s2">I think we get to articulate the simple stuff<br />first, which is only what you expect, right?</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.620" end="00:14:02.120" style="s2">Because when you’re mastering something<br />difficult, like the unfolding of being, the</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.120" end="00:14:05.980" style="s2">probability that you’re going to get to<br />the simple things first and the complicated</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.980" end="00:14:07.870" style="s2">things later is pretty much 100%.</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.870" end="00:14:15.490" style="s2">And I mean, different fields advance at different<br />speeds, but the artists and musicians get</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.490" end="00:14:21.260" style="s2">to the complex matters far before the scientists<br />and the engineers.</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.260" end="00:14:22.670" style="s2">And it has to be that way.</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.670" end="00:14:30.050" style="s2">One of the deep things I learned from Jung<br />was that, as our knowledge expands out into</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.050" end="00:14:35.160" style="s2">the unknown, there are people operating at<br />the periphery, and so they really have one</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.160" end="00:14:38.550" style="s2">foot in the unknown and one foot on dry land,<br />so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.550" end="00:14:41.080" style="s2">And some of them are more in the water than<br />the others.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.080" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">And the ones almost submerged up to their<br />neck, when they tell you what they’re seeing,</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:51.089" style="s2">it has to be poetic and musical and artistic,<br />because it’s so far beyond our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.089" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">to articulate, that we can’t represent it<br />in words.</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:15:00.180" style="s2">And so all that can happen is that the artist<br />can get hold of it, and maybe the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.180" end="00:15:06.139" style="s2">are prone to religious-like sentiments, at<br />least experiences, which seems to be associated</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.139" end="00:15:07.770" style="s2">by the way with the trait openness.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.770" end="00:15:12.500" style="s2">To have the actual religious experience, rather<br />than to be an adherent of the dogma, which</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.500" end="00:15:14.870" style="s2">is associated with low openness.</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.870" end="00:15:21.660" style="s2">So for Jung, it was the artists and the entrepreneurs,<br />because they’re the same people, who were</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.660" end="00:15:25.460" style="s2">at the forefront of the expansion of what<br />we know into what is unknown.</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.460" end="00:15:30.620" style="s2">And I think you can see echoes of that in<br />the way in which cities are rejuvenated.</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.620" end="00:15:34.389" style="s2">Because what happens, you can certainly see<br />this in Toronto, is that a part of the city</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.389" end="00:15:40.600" style="s2">that has some architectural or contextual<br />interest but is badly run down, starts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.600" end="00:15:45.510" style="s2">get… at some point, you know, the artistic<br />people show up and they think “Hey!</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.510" end="00:15:46.820" style="s2">This is kind of cool.</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.820" end="00:15:49.880" style="s2">If we just did this to it there’d really<br />be something to it”.</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.880" end="00:15:54.339" style="s2">And it usually doesn’t hurt that the rents<br />are low because of course artists never have</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.339" end="00:15:55.660" style="s2">any money.</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.660" end="00:15:58.209" style="s2">So then they go in there and civilise the<br />hell out of it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.209" end="00:16:01.870" style="s2">And of course, they’re renting, and that<br />jacks up the property value, and then the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.870" end="00:16:05.990" style="s2">people who are a little less open but kind<br />of interested in art start flowing in behind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.990" end="00:16:06.990" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.990" end="00:16:11.610" style="s2">And then soon the whole place is rejuvenated<br />and expensive, and of course the artists have</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.610" end="00:16:13.130" style="s2">to go somewhere else.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.130" end="00:16:17.290" style="s2">But that’s a very interesting phenomenon,<br />because what’s happening is that even in</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.290" end="00:16:24.850" style="s2">the cities they’re taking chaos and turning<br />it into order, and that’s what artists do.</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.850" end="00:16:31.710" style="s2">Now that’s all to tell you that there are<br />different ways of transmitting and representing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.710" end="00:16:38.579" style="s2">information, and that you can incorporate<br />the information without any articulated notion</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.579" end="00:16:40.339" style="s2">of what you’re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.339" end="00:16:44.459" style="s2">So of course that’s the case, because otherwise<br />you’d have to claim that you understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.459" end="00:16:51.269" style="s2">everything that you do and can articulate<br />it, and that’s just wrong, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.269" end="00:16:55.020" style="s2">You have a theory of yourself but it’s not<br />a very accurate theory, which is why you’re</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.020" end="00:16:59.110" style="s2">always doing things that are strange as far<br />as you’re concerned, which is also extremely</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.110" end="00:17:00.110" style="s2">bizarre.</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.110" end="00:17:05.230" style="s2">It’s like, who the hell are you if you can’t<br />even control your own behaviour?</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.230" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">And what does it mean to control it, and what<br />does it mean to not control it?</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:12.600" style="s2">These are very, very complex and strange issues.</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.600" end="00:17:20.649" style="s2">Alright, so I think the best way into this<br />is actually from an evolutionary perspective.</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.649" end="00:17:27.510" style="s2">And I’m not convinced that this is correct<br />but I think there’s something to it.</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.510" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">So when you think about the nature of experience,<br />then you think, well the nature of experience</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:42.289" style="s2">is quite different for different sorts of<br />creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.289" end="00:17:45.779" style="s2">And one of the primary differences between<br />creatures is the degree to which they’re</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.779" end="00:17:50.330" style="s2">capable of social interaction and then of<br />complex social interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.330" end="00:17:54.769" style="s2">And primates generally speaking are very social<br />creatures.</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.769" end="00:18:00.039" style="s2">They live in troops, or packs, like dogs.</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.039" end="00:18:03.109" style="s2">Which is why we can get along with dogs, because<br />we understand each other.</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.109" end="00:18:07.450" style="s2">Being hierarchical troop animals, we understand<br />dogs, and they understand us, and they can</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.450" end="00:18:10.190" style="s2">fit right in, pretty much.</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.190" end="00:18:16.490" style="s2">And we’re very, very good at figuring out<br />where we are in the troop.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.490" end="00:18:19.399" style="s2">And by ‘we’ I mean primates.</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.399" end="00:18:22.139" style="s2">I mean that’s going back a very, very long<br />period of time.</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.139" end="00:18:27.289" style="s2">You know, monkeys and chimpanzees have very<br />sophisticated knowledge of the social structures</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.289" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">surrounding them.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.090" style="s2">They know who’s who, and they know what<br />status they are, they know what rank they</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.090" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">are, essentially.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:37.090" style="s2">And that’s also the case with people.</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.090" end="00:18:42.929" style="s2">And so one of the things you might say about<br />people is that our reality isn’t nature,</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.929" end="00:18:43.929" style="s2">exactly.</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.929" end="00:18:45.779" style="s2">It’s culture.</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.779" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">Now, you can make the argument that you can’t<br />really distinguish nature from culture, and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:56.279" style="s2">I believe that that’s true and untrue, in<br />a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.279" end="00:19:01.590" style="s2">I think you can talk about the human and non-human<br />elements of reality.</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.590" end="00:19:06.529" style="s2">And you can identify the human elements of<br />reality as culture, even though culture is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.529" end="00:19:11.989" style="s2">so old that you can also think about it as<br />an inevitable part of nature.</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.989" end="00:19:19.230" style="s2">So anyway, so most of our experience in our<br />evolutionary past, at least let’s say for</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.230" end="00:19:24.989" style="s2">the last several million years, we might as<br />well go back to when the ancestors of humans</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.989" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">hypothetically split off from the ancestors<br />of chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:36.210" style="s2">And people know very accurately when these<br />sorts of splits occur, by the way, because</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.210" end="00:19:40.389" style="s2">what they do is they have some sense of the<br />rate of transformation of DNA.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.389" end="00:19:44.800" style="s2">You know it transforms and the rate is fairly<br />constant across time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.800" end="00:19:50.630" style="s2">And so if you take two creatures and you determine<br />how much genetic similarity there is between</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.630" end="00:19:56.220" style="s2">them, and how much difference, you could calculate<br />how far back they diverged.</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.220" end="00:19:59.919" style="s2">And so, the fossil record helps with that,<br />although it’s very sparse.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.919" end="00:20:04.889" style="s2">But the DNA record is not very sparse at all,<br />in some sense, so you can be very accurate</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.889" end="00:20:05.889" style="s2">about it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.889" end="00:20:11.349" style="s2">We can even tell when people evolved or learned<br />to wear clothing, and the reason we can tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.349" end="00:20:15.979" style="s2">that is because there’s certain kinds of<br />lice that can only live on clothing, and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.979" end="00:20:20.679" style="s2">seem to have diverged from the lice that live<br />in hair about 50,000 years ago, something</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.679" end="00:20:21.769" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.769" end="00:20:25.200" style="s2">And so the hypothesis is that, well, we must<br />have been figuring out how to wear clothes</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.200" end="00:20:27.869" style="s2">at that point because the lice figured out<br />how to live in them.</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.869" end="00:20:31.700" style="s2">So, you know, it probably took them a little<br />while, but I doubt if it took them very long.</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.700" end="00:20:36.919" style="s2">You know those little creatures that breed<br />fast, man those things can evolve quickly,</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.919" end="00:20:38.899" style="s2">much to our dismay.</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.899" end="00:20:46.409" style="s2">So okay, so a big part of the experiential<br />field of advanced primates is the social world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.409" end="00:20:48.419" style="s2">And so we could call that the primate world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.419" end="00:20:53.139" style="s2">And we could also say that another big part<br />of their experience is the non-primate world,</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.139" end="00:20:56.340" style="s2">which would be, roughly speaking, the natural<br />world.</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.340" end="00:21:02.289" style="s2">And then we could also say that the other<br />elements of their experience that are very</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.289" end="00:21:07.009" style="s2">constant are their subjective being.</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.009" end="00:21:13.239" style="s2">And we don’t know much about the subjective<br />being of creatures like chimpanzees, although</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.239" end="00:21:18.230" style="s2">you can understand, I think, the subjective<br />being of a dog well enough to befriend the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.230" end="00:21:19.259" style="s2">dog.</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.259" end="00:21:21.429" style="s2">And so you have some insight.</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.429" end="00:21:25.210" style="s2">And I think it’s also reasonable to assume<br />that…</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.210" end="00:21:29.309" style="s2">I mean for a long time people were unwilling<br />to admit that animals had a soul, that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.309" end="00:21:30.309" style="s2">the first problem.</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.309" end="00:21:32.789" style="s2">But after that, that they were conscious.</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.789" end="00:21:34.779" style="s2">And even the behaviourists fought that notion.</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.779" end="00:21:40.009" style="s2">But I think the simplest thing to do is to<br />assume that animals and human beings are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.009" end="00:21:42.470" style="s2">same, except when you can prove that they’re<br />different.</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.470" end="00:21:46.849" style="s2">Because we share so much of our evolutionary<br />past then the logical inference is that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.849" end="00:21:51.169" style="s2">you think a dog is doing something sort of<br />like you would do in that situation, and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.169" end="00:21:55.580" style="s2">that way, it probably is, with certain exceptions<br />for species difference.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.580" end="00:21:59.489" style="s2">And if that wasn’t the case I don’t think<br />that you could have a relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.489" end="00:22:01.080" style="s2">dog, or cat.</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.080" end="00:22:06.590" style="s2">You can’t have much of a relationship with<br />a lizard, although there are lizards, bearded</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.590" end="00:22:08.409" style="s2">dragons in particular, that are social.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.409" end="00:22:11.249" style="s2">They like to lay on top of each other and<br />they hang around together.</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.249" end="00:22:13.909" style="s2">And you can actually have more of a relationship<br />with them.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.909" end="00:22:16.440" style="s2">And apparently the same is true for iguanas.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.440" end="00:22:24.830" style="s2">So you can go quite a ways backwards in evolutionary<br />time, and still have enough similarity between</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.830" end="00:22:28.580" style="s2">you and the creature that you’re interacting<br />with, so you can get a pretty good sense of</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.580" end="00:22:31.549" style="s2">at least some element of their being.</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.549" end="00:22:38.580" style="s2">And so, the idea that subjective, or subjectivity,<br />is a very ancient part of our experience,</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.580" end="00:22:41.419" style="s2">seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable supposition.</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.419" end="00:22:46.190" style="s2">We certainly know that it’s been around,<br />in all likelihood, for at least 150,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.190" end="00:22:51.220" style="s2">(on the conservative side), because there<br />have been human beings that are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.220" end="00:22:56.700" style="s2">identical to us, from a genetic perspective,<br />going back 150,000 years.</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.700" end="00:23:01.820" style="s2">But I think you’d have to be a pretty harsh<br />judge to assume that higher-order primates</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.820" end="00:23:04.899" style="s2">like chimps don’t have some consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.899" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">And you know, and some limited self-consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:15.259" style="s2">You know, if you mark a chimp’s nose with<br />lipstick and then show it a mirror, it will,</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.259" end="00:23:18.200" style="s2">at least sometimes, take the lipstick off<br />its nose.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.200" end="00:23:21.889" style="s2">Although I’ve seen a gorilla try to fight<br />with a mirror.</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.889" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">Well no, I haven’t personally seen that,<br />but I’ve seen a very good video of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:27.720" style="s2">happening.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.720" end="00:23:33.889" style="s2">But I think the gorilla in it would eventually<br />figure out that it was him in the mirror.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.889" end="00:23:39.320" style="s2">Dogs will recognise a dog in the mirror, but<br />they seem to ignore their reflection very,</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.320" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">very rapidly.</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:44.059" style="s2">And I don’t know if that means that they<br />have a very rudimentary self-consciousness,</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.059" end="00:23:49.289" style="s2">and that they figure out that that dog is<br />them, or if the dog just doesn’t smell like</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.289" end="00:23:53.229" style="s2">a dog, and then the dog thinks “well it<br />can’t be a dog because it doesn’t smell</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.229" end="00:23:54.229" style="s2">like a dog”.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.229" end="00:23:58.219" style="s2">And dogs probably think that something is<br />a dog because of how it smells, and not because</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.219" end="00:24:01.130" style="s2">of how it looks.</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.130" end="00:24:05.399" style="s2">I think that’s why dogs don’t seem to<br />have any sense of relative size.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.399" end="00:24:11.559" style="s2">Because you can get a little Chihuahua barking<br />like mad at a Great Dane and you think, really?</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.559" end="00:24:13.320" style="s2">That’s going to work, is it?</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.320" end="00:24:17.539" style="s2">But the dog doesn’t seem to have a clue<br />about that, like he’s perfectly happy.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.539" end="00:24:21.990" style="s2">And the Great Dane, weirdly enough, will often<br />back off.</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.990" end="00:24:31.049" style="s2">Anyway, okay, so we’ve been in a social<br />world, a deeply social world for a long time,</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.049" end="00:24:35.009" style="s2">and I’m also going to make the presupposition<br />that we’ve been in the stratified social</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.009" end="00:24:36.779" style="s2">world for a very long period of time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.779" end="00:24:41.649" style="s2">And I think you could call that, if you wanted<br />to, and I would never want to, by the way,</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.649" end="00:24:45.109" style="s2">you could call that the patriarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.109" end="00:24:50.269" style="s2">I think that I wouldn’t call it that because<br />that’s not what it is.</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.269" end="00:24:58.349" style="s2">But I think that the fact that it’s called<br />that, and that that’s accepted as a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.349" end="00:25:02.639" style="s2">representation is actually a consequence of<br />the action of an archetype.</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.639" end="00:25:08.219" style="s2">And the archetype is that, it’s the archetype<br />of the terrible Great Father, actually.</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.219" end="00:25:12.129" style="s2">Because you think, well there’s a social<br />structure with striations in it, and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.129" end="00:25:13.499" style="s2">has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.499" end="00:25:16.349" style="s2">And the advantages are that you can live in<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.349" end="00:25:20.059" style="s2">And the disadvantages are that you have to<br />follow the damn rules, and they might not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.059" end="00:25:22.639" style="s2">necessarily be to your individual benefit.</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.639" end="00:25:30.659" style="s2">So, within a social dominance hierarchy, there’s<br />always a bifurcated, it also always has bifurcated</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.659" end="00:25:31.659" style="s2">significance.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.659" end="00:25:38.360" style="s2">It can be good, and is good, insofar as it<br />protects you from, say, from threat from without,</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.360" end="00:25:42.109" style="s2">maybe from other primates invading your territory,<br />for example.</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.109" end="00:25:49.190" style="s2">But it can also be a very dismal structure<br />if you happen to be at the bottom of the hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.190" end="00:25:59.039" style="s2">So anyways, as far as I can tell, that dominance<br />structure is typically represented as masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.039" end="00:26:04.759" style="s2">And I think the reason for that, although<br />I’m not absolutely certain of this, I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.759" end="00:26:09.229" style="s2">the reason for that is that our social hierarchies<br />are probably more like chimp social hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.229" end="00:26:11.389" style="s2">than they are like bonobo social hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.389" end="00:26:14.399" style="s2">So, the bonobos are kind of a strange breed<br />of chimps.</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.399" end="00:26:16.369" style="s2">I don’t know how many of you know about<br />them.</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.369" end="00:26:24.149" style="s2">But the bonobos are extraordinarily sexual<br />and they use sex, pretty much as a standard</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.149" end="00:26:27.009" style="s2">means of communication and tension reduction.</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.009" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">And there’s a lot of sex between the females<br />and the bonobo troops, and the use of sex</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:38.170" style="s2">seems to bond them together in a way that<br />keeps male aggression under control, which</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.170" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">is quite interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:45.880" style="s2">But in the chimps the fundamental dominance<br />hierarchy is male, although there’s a female</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.880" end="00:26:51.000" style="s2">dominance hierarchy as well, and some females<br />can certainly be more dominant than some males.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.000" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">But the fundamental structure seems to be<br />male.</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:27:00.149" style="s2">And then I would also say, well, it’s probably<br />dependent to some degree in the primate community,</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.149" end="00:27:03.289" style="s2">and in other social animals, on other factors.</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.289" end="00:27:10.330" style="s2">So we know, for example, that the gender that<br />has the highest level of testosterone tends</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.330" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">to be the dominant gender.</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:16.259" style="s2">And so in hyenas the females actually have<br />a higher level of testosterone.</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.259" end="00:27:19.479" style="s2">They’re actually bigger and more aggressive<br />than the males, and the price they pay for</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.479" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">that is that they have to give birth through<br />a structure that’s very much like a penis,</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:29.539" style="s2">which is not the world’s most pleasant experience,<br />and might account for the hyenas’ temper.</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.539" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">But, in human beings, you know, you see sexual<br />dimorphism.</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:40.249" style="s2">Men are slightly bigger than women, and that’s<br />also generally characteristic of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.249" end="00:27:44.519" style="s2">that have a dominance hierarchy that’s tilted<br />towards masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.519" end="00:27:52.519" style="s2">And then the other factor seems to be that<br />human beings have… our infants have very,</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.519" end="00:28:00.279" style="s2">very, very, very long periods of dependence,<br />and it’s very difficult to manoeuver your</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.279" end="00:28:06.969" style="s2">way, doing anything, really, especially anything<br />that has to do with competition and power,</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.969" end="00:28:12.789" style="s2">if you’re taking care of one infant, let<br />alone three.</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.789" end="00:28:22.279" style="s2">And so, it seems to me that those are all<br />valid reasons why the primary power structures</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.279" end="00:28:27.519" style="s2">among human beings have typically been male,<br />and why they’re represented as masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.519" end="00:28:31.519" style="s2">Now there are other reasons too, because this<br />is a multi-faceted phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.519" end="00:28:37.539" style="s2">I mean, one of the things that’s interesting<br />about human females is that they’re selective</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.539" end="00:28:38.989" style="s2">maters.</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.989" end="00:28:43.399" style="s2">Now chimp females are not selective maters,<br />and what that means is that the dominant males</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.399" end="00:28:46.960" style="s2">still have most of the offspring, but the<br />reason for that, apparently, is because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.960" end="00:28:51.850" style="s2">chase the subordinate males away from sexually<br />receptive females.</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.850" end="00:28:55.970" style="s2">Although the sexually receptive females will<br />sneak off behind the rocks somewhere and mate</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.970" end="00:28:58.809" style="s2">with the subordinate male.</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.809" end="00:29:03.549" style="s2">But as long as the dominant male is around<br />the probability of that is quite low.</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.549" end="00:29:08.759" style="s2">So the female chimps aren’t sexually selective,<br />whereas human females have concealed ovulation,</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.759" end="00:29:13.940" style="s2">so that no one knows when they’re at their<br />most fertile, and they’re selective maters.</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.940" end="00:29:18.239" style="s2">And women in every society virtually, that’s<br />ever been studies, have a typical pattern</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.239" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">of behaviour, which is that if you look at<br />the female dominance hierarchy and you look</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">at the male dominance hierarchy, the females<br />will mate across and up dominance hierarchies,</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">and the males will mate across and down.</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:35.289" style="s2">Which works fine for both genders, because<br />their interests align.</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.289" end="00:29:42.419" style="s2">But it also means that in all likelihood women<br />have exerted tremendous sexual selection pressure</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.419" end="00:29:47.549" style="s2">on men, and that might be part of the reason,<br />of the many reasons, that we actually… you</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.549" end="00:29:51.700" style="s2">know the theory is that the common ancestor<br />between chimps and humans was probably a lot</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.700" end="00:29:55.080" style="s2">more like a chimp, a modern chimp, than like<br />a modern human.</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.080" end="00:29:59.710" style="s2">So for whatever reason, we’ve undergone<br />a lot more transformation in the last 7 million</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.710" end="00:30:01.360" style="s2">years than chimps have.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.360" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">And one possible reason for that, and I think<br />it’s a highly probable reason, is that sexual</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:11.100" style="s2">selection operated a lot more viciously, so<br />to speak, among humans.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.100" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">It’s operated to the point where you have<br />twice as many female ancestors as male.</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:20.759" style="s2">And you might think, well that can’t be<br />possible, but here’s how it’s possible.</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.759" end="00:30:26.519" style="s2">It’s like, only every second man has children,<br />had a child, while all women had one.</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.519" end="00:30:30.039" style="s2">Now of course, that isn’t what happened,<br />but on average that’s what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.039" end="00:30:36.570" style="s2">So the proportion of men who are completely<br />childless in any given generation is far higher</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.570" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">than the proportion of women who are.</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:45.460" style="s2">So you see an element of expendability in<br />males, and that’s typical across the biological</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.460" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">community, because you don’t need as many<br />males as you need females in order to keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">the population moving forward.</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:55.950" style="s2">And one of the things that happens as a consequence<br />of that, at least in principle, is that males</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.950" end="00:31:01.580" style="s2">are more behaviourally variable and variable<br />across a lot of dimensions, than females are.</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.580" end="00:31:05.899" style="s2">And that’s a plus, because they’re more<br />variable on the upside, but it’s also negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.899" end="00:31:09.110" style="s2">because they’re more prevalent on the downside.</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.110" end="00:31:13.739" style="s2">Now there’s some substantial argument about<br />that in relationship to people, what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.739" end="00:31:18.019" style="s2">implications of that are for human beings.</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.019" end="00:31:24.739" style="s2">One potential implication is that although<br />women and men have equivalent IQs, the standard</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.739" end="00:31:26.249" style="s2">deviation is slightly different.</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.249" end="00:31:30.659" style="s2">Which means that there are more males who<br />are intellectually impaired, but there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.659" end="00:31:35.149" style="s2">also more males who are four and five standard<br />deviations above the population mean.</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.149" end="00:31:40.700" style="s2">You don’t need much of a difference in standard<br />deviation in order to produce radical differences</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.700" end="00:31:42.080" style="s2">at the extreme.</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.080" end="00:31:45.539" style="s2">So I’ll give you an example.</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.539" end="00:31:50.940" style="s2">Males are more aggressive than females among<br />humans, but the effect is only about half</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.940" end="00:31:52.149" style="s2">a standard deviation.</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.149" end="00:31:59.769" style="s2">And so what that means is that, if you take<br />a female and a male randomly from a population</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.769" end="00:32:04.840" style="s2">and you were trying to guess who was the more<br />aggressive of the two, most of the time, you</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.840" end="00:32:10.190" style="s2">know about 60% of the time, the male would<br />be more aggressive than the female, but 40%</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.190" end="00:32:11.450" style="s2">of the time it would be reversed.</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.450" end="00:32:13.850" style="s2">So you know, that’s a lot of overlap.</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.850" end="00:32:17.389" style="s2">But then here’s the rub.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.389" end="00:32:22.629" style="s2">So let’s say just for example, that among<br />the population of men and women combined,</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.629" end="00:32:28.249" style="s2">only the most aggressive person out of a hundred<br />ends up in jail.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.249" end="00:32:29.739" style="s2">Those are all men.</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.739" end="00:32:35.629" style="s2">Because that tilt towards aggression is enough,<br />so that when you go way out on the distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.629" end="00:32:39.820" style="s2">the only people who are that extreme are men,<br />even though the population difference isn’t</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.820" end="00:32:40.969" style="s2">that great.</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.969" end="00:32:47.349" style="s2">So anyways, there’s a massive debate in<br />the relevant literature about the potential</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.349" end="00:32:51.469" style="s2">consequences of that for things like cognitive<br />function, because there’s some indication</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.469" end="00:32:56.399" style="s2">as well that men are more cognitively specialised<br />but women are more cognitively robust.</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.399" end="00:33:00.239" style="s2">Anyways, it doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.239" end="00:33:04.839" style="s2">But what does matter is the fact of this permanent<br />dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.839" end="00:33:10.639" style="s2">Now, the dominance hierarchy, the male dominance<br />hierarchy, also has another feature.</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.639" end="00:33:15.849" style="s2">So we already said that, you know, on average,<br />men are half as likely to leave offspring</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.849" end="00:33:17.289" style="s2">as women are.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.289" end="00:33:23.499" style="s2">And so what that means is that all things<br />considered… this isn’t…</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.499" end="00:33:28.179" style="s2">I’m not trying to make this into a circular<br />argument.</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.179" end="00:33:31.370" style="s2">Because I could say it’s the more successful<br />males that leave more offspring.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.370" end="00:33:34.959" style="s2">But then you’d say, well that’s the definition,<br />Darwinian definition, of success.</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.959" end="00:33:39.499" style="s2">But I don’t mean Darwinian success, because<br />that’s self-evident.</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.499" end="00:33:44.679" style="s2">What I mean is, if you look in the modern<br />world for example, and you try to predict</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.679" end="00:33:50.999" style="s2">number of available sexual partners for a<br />given male, your best predictive measure of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.999" end="00:33:53.350" style="s2">that is income.</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.350" end="00:33:57.729" style="s2">And the best predictive measure of that is<br />intelligence and conscientiousness.</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.729" end="00:34:04.709" style="s2">And so, what happens is that males orient<br />themselves in groups, and then they compete.</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.709" end="00:34:07.049" style="s2">And then women peel off the top.</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.049" end="00:34:13.929" style="s2">And so the women are in a position of judgment<br />on men, and the judgment is the judgment of</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.929" end="00:34:14.929" style="s2">nature.</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.929" end="00:34:20.579" style="s2">Now, from a Darwinian perspective… you know,<br />when we think of nature we think of, well</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.579" end="00:34:24.290" style="s2">it depends on who you are, but if you’re<br />an environmentalist you think of a French</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.290" end="00:34:29.700" style="s2">impressionist landscape, you know, forgetting<br />that nature is also malarial mosquitoes and</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">cancer, and rats infected with bubonic plague<br />and all those other lovely things.</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.579" style="s2">But, from a Darwinian perspective, you can<br />define nature much more straight-forwardly,</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.579" end="00:34:44.830" style="s2">and more accurately, as that which selects.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.830" end="00:34:50.460" style="s2">Now, you know, you hear a lot about natural<br />selection, and natural selection basically</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.460" end="00:34:56.180" style="s2">assumes that there is a random distribution<br />of alteration in genetic structure, in any</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.180" end="00:35:00.420" style="s2">population, in any generation.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.420" end="00:35:05.440" style="s2">And some of those random alterations will<br />be more suited to that particular environment,</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.440" end="00:35:09.740" style="s2">suited being they’ll live and they’ll<br />reproduce.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.740" end="00:35:16.950" style="s2">And genetic transformation takes place across<br />the millennia as the organism chases the landscape,</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.950" end="00:35:17.950" style="s2">roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.950" end="00:35:25.670" style="s2">But Darwin, you know, Darwin, who was an unbelievably<br />intelligent person, was also very, very interested</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.670" end="00:35:30.470" style="s2">in sexual selection, and as far as Darwin<br />was concerned, sexual selection was just as</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.470" end="00:35:38.819" style="s2">powerful in modifying genetic structure, in<br />driving evolution, as natural selection.</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.819" end="00:35:41.540" style="s2">And that’s been very underplayed by biologists.</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.540" end="00:35:44.270" style="s2">That’s only started to switch in the last…</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.270" end="00:35:49.330" style="s2">I would say it hasn’t switched that much<br />yet, but it started to switch probably in</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.330" end="00:35:51.420" style="s2">about the last 25 years.</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.420" end="00:35:58.910" style="s2">And that’s because the idea of sexual selection<br />makes things a hell of a lot more complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.910" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">Because, well first of all, in a standard<br />Darwinian account of evolution, there’s</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:08.750" style="s2">no place for mind, there’s no place for<br />a creator, there’s no place for teleology.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.750" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">And teleology is something moving towards<br />an end, a goal, right?</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:22.559" style="s2">But the thing is, if sexual selection is operative,<br />and if consciousness is ancient, then mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.559" end="00:36:27.550" style="s2">has been operating through sexual selection<br />as long as there’s been sexual selection.</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.550" end="00:36:34.220" style="s2">So you think, do you have any choice, do you<br />make any choice in who your sexual partner</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.220" end="00:36:35.220" style="s2">will be?</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.220" end="00:36:41.380" style="s2">And the answer to that is, well it’s hardly<br />random, you make a choice!</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.380" end="00:36:46.040" style="s2">And what’s interesting is that, you know,<br />if you take 60 people, let’s say if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.040" end="00:36:49.220" style="s2">took 60 women, and you showed them a bunch<br />of men, and you asked them to rank them in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.220" end="00:36:53.270" style="s2">terms of their attractiveness, there’s going<br />to be very consistent rankings.</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.270" end="00:36:58.490" style="s2">You know, I mean, we know what makes up attractive<br />facial features, for women and for men, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.490" end="00:36:59.529" style="s2">easy to determine that.</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.529" end="00:37:05.010" style="s2">What you do is you take 60 faces and you average<br />the features.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.010" end="00:37:09.390" style="s2">So you don’t get the average person, because<br />the average person is more like a median,</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.390" end="00:37:11.430" style="s2">you get the averaged person.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.430" end="00:37:16.670" style="s2">And the averaged person has perfectly symmetrical<br />features that are nicely shaped, and fairly</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.670" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">big eyes, and they’re very nice-looking,<br />they’re very attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:29.329" style="s2">And so, that means that there’s like a central<br />human form, in a sense, that we find attractive.</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.329" end="00:37:33.430" style="s2">And we see this in other species, for example<br />there are butterflies who won’t mate with</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.430" end="00:37:39.290" style="s2">another butterfly if it’s like a sixteenth<br />of an inch out of symmetry, because it’s</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.290" end="00:37:41.660" style="s2">not a butterfly of that type, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.660" end="00:37:47.559" style="s2">And that’s how people think too, if you<br />deviate from the averaged person, the less</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.559" end="00:37:51.640" style="s2">canonically human you appear, and the less<br />attractive you appear.</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.640" end="00:37:55.750" style="s2">And, you know, we’re chasing this ideal<br />in some sense that’s an emergent property</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.750" end="00:37:57.940" style="s2">of the nature of our species.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.940" end="00:38:04.620" style="s2">And then, you know, there’s certain physical<br />characteristics, wide shoulders in men, and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.620" end="00:38:05.620" style="s2">narrow waists.</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.620" end="00:38:10.019" style="s2">In women, it’s waist-to-hip ratio, a very<br />common marker of beauty, across cultures,</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.019" end="00:38:13.109" style="s2">and across body types, interestingly enough.</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.109" end="00:38:18.890" style="s2">So, if you take thin women and heavier women,<br />and you get men to rate the attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.890" end="00:38:23.430" style="s2">of the women within that category, the heavy<br />women and the light women who have a waist-to-hip</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.430" end="00:38:27.750" style="s2">ratio of about 0.68 are the ones that are<br />judged most attractive physically.</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.750" end="00:38:33.059" style="s2">And so, that actually correlates, by the way,<br />with fertility, because the abdominal fat</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.059" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">in a young woman is a sign of ill health and<br />also a marker of decreased likelihood of conception.</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.790" end="00:38:43.730" style="s2">Now none of this is operating consciously,<br />obviously, it’s deeply wired into us, it’s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.730" end="00:38:46.779" style="s2">part of our mediate perception.</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.779" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">But it still does indicate that there’s<br />an ideal, like a platonic ideal, lurking at</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:56.510" style="s2">the back of our minds, against whom we compare<br />everyone that we meet.</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.510" end="00:39:00.750" style="s2">And then you might say, well what’s the<br />nature of that platonic ideal, and that’s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.750" end="00:39:03.420" style="s2">a very, very complicated question.</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.420" end="00:39:13.569" style="s2">You know, I would say that you could almost<br />literally claim that the… well you can certainly</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.569" end="00:39:22.410" style="s2">claim that the ideal male is represented in<br />mythology as a hero.</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.410" end="00:39:25.950" style="s2">And that’s actually what mythology is about,<br />it’s about representing ideal patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.950" end="00:39:28.450" style="s2">behaviour, so it’s hardly surprising.</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.450" end="00:39:33.390" style="s2">And so, you know, if you go to a movie, and<br />it’s a romance, and there’s the main lead</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.390" end="00:39:37.700" style="s2">character that you’re supposed to fall in<br />love with (if you happen to be the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.700" end="00:39:44.000" style="s2">person that would fall in love with that kind<br />of person), then he’s going to act out a</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:45.700" style="s2">particular pattern of behaviour.</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.700" end="00:39:48.280" style="s2">And the pattern of behaviour is quite identifiable.</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.280" end="00:39:53.390" style="s2">So for example he’s going to move forward<br />and explore, and not hide and cower.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.390" end="00:39:56.650" style="s2">And the probability that he’s going to be<br />creative is very high, and the probability</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.650" end="00:40:00.000" style="s2">that he’s going to be good-looking and strong<br />is very high.</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.000" end="00:40:03.420" style="s2">And so, those are archetypal features.</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.420" end="00:40:09.450" style="s2">And those aren’t all the archetypal features,<br />because those are, in some sense, those are</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.450" end="00:40:11.530" style="s2">the self-evident ones.</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.530" end="00:40:16.539" style="s2">But you know, people are also evaluating each<br />other for things like intelligence, and personality,</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.539" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">and character.</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">And you could say in some sense that men are<br />competing to be the best man, and women are</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:29.789" style="s2">watching the competition to take the man who<br />wins on the presupposition that he wouldn’t</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.789" end="00:40:31.029" style="s2">win if he wasn’t the best man.</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.029" end="00:40:34.200" style="s2">It’s a very, very intelligent strategy.</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.200" end="00:40:36.700" style="s2">Because why not outsource the problem.</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.700" end="00:40:42.309" style="s2">Let the men sort it out, well as I say, it’s<br />too cognitively complex to compute.</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.309" end="00:40:45.859" style="s2">You could say that the male dominance hierarchy<br />is equivalent to the stock market.</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.859" end="00:40:48.609" style="s2">It’s exactly equivalent to the stock market.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.609" end="00:40:54.809" style="s2">The stocks are always competing with one another,<br />and with every other commodity, for primacy</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.809" end="00:40:59.660" style="s2">of price and value, and that’s exactly what<br />happens with male competition.</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.660" end="00:41:04.130" style="s2">So one of the things that we’ve just discovered<br />in my lab, this is Caitlyn Burton’s work,</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.130" end="00:41:09.420" style="s2">it’s very cool, is that we took… we were<br />trying to understand the fundamental sub-structure</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.420" end="00:41:13.400" style="s2">of conservatism vs. liberalism.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.400" end="00:41:18.440" style="s2">And I’m going to speak in terms of conservatism,<br />because that’s how we construed the data,</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.440" end="00:41:21.039" style="s2">although we could’ve done the reverse if<br />we were going to construe liberalism.</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.039" end="00:41:25.781" style="s2">And what we did was we took, we got a bunch<br />of people to sit down and write down a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.781" end="00:41:30.230" style="s2">of statements that they though conservatives<br />vs. liberals would disagree with.</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.230" end="00:41:33.769" style="s2">You know, I think we had, I don’t remember<br />how many statements, 300 statements, something</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.769" end="00:41:34.769" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.769" end="00:41:38.160" style="s2">We had a lot of people generate them and take<br />them from news items and so forth, because</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.160" end="00:41:42.930" style="s2">we didn’t want any bias in the initial question<br />set.</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.930" end="00:41:48.290" style="s2">Or we didn’t want a bias that wasn’t there<br />in the actual world.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.290" end="00:41:53.109" style="s2">So we had many people do this, and then we<br />gave these questions to many, many people</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.109" end="00:41:56.549" style="s2">online, in a variety of stages.</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.549" end="00:42:03.450" style="s2">And we extracted those out that seemed to<br />best fit the data, and then assessed them</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.450" end="00:42:07.690" style="s2">for the utility in predicting things like<br />party membership or voting behaviour.</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.690" end="00:42:11.150" style="s2">And so we got a good structure, it makes a<br />lot of sense, and what we found with regards</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.150" end="00:42:18.480" style="s2">to conservatism was that there was an ethnocentrism<br />factor, it was the third and weakest factor,</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.480" end="00:42:23.130" style="s2">and that would be associated with in-group<br />preference vs. out-group derogation.</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.130" end="00:42:29.700" style="s2">So those are anti-immigrant people, fundamentally,<br />you know, and they’re, well they’re ethnocentric.</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.700" end="00:42:36.420" style="s2">That’s the simplest way to explain it.</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.420" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">And then the second smallest factor was religious<br />traditionalism.</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.640" style="s2">And most of this was done with Americans,<br />for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.640" end="00:42:49.609" style="s2">And that was really where the fundamentalist<br />Christians nested.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.609" end="00:42:57.390" style="s2">And not everyone… that was not only a factor<br />made up of fundamentalist Christian beliefs,</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.390" end="00:42:59.700" style="s2">but they loaded heavily.</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.700" end="00:43:04.009" style="s2">Those were people who weren’t for stem cell<br />research, they were anti-abortion, they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.009" end="00:43:06.109" style="s2">anti-gay marriage.</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.109" end="00:43:10.569" style="s2">Or they were pro-traditional, which is how<br />they see themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.569" end="00:43:19.019" style="s2">And then, the largest factor was a factor<br />that we called ‘masculine independence’.</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.019" end="00:43:25.089" style="s2">And it was more characteristic of men, and<br />what it basically consisted of was an attitude</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.089" end="00:43:28.790" style="s2">that winners win and losers lose, and that’s<br />just how it should be.</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.790" end="00:43:36.529" style="s2">So it was the men who… the personality predictors,<br />one of them was extroverted assertiveness…</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.529" end="00:43:44.339" style="s2">hunting and the right to own firearms also<br />loaded on this factor, but it was masculine</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.339" end="00:43:48.770" style="s2">competitiveness, I think, is the best way<br />of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.770" end="00:43:56.010" style="s2">And I think it’s a good illustration of<br />the kind of individual attitude that makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.010" end="00:44:00.849" style="s2">you more likely to attempt to climb up dominance<br />hierarchies and dominate them from the top</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.849" end="00:44:01.849" style="s2">down.</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.849" end="00:44:05.400" style="s2">And that’s not necessarily something that<br />would be associated with factors like compassion.</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.400" end="00:44:09.750" style="s2">Well, I’ll leave it at that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.750" end="00:44:11.619" style="s2">It’s just that you can see…</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.619" end="00:44:16.190" style="s2">I’m telling you that because you can see<br />how these proclivities manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.190" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">in all sorts of areas of behaviour.</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:25.300" style="s2">I can tell you something else that’s very<br />interesting about men and violence.</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.300" end="00:44:39.930" style="s2">I don’t know if I can get this story straight<br />because it’s been a while since I told it.</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.930" end="00:44:46.839" style="s2">So there’s this interesting phenomenon,<br />that’s very characteristic of societies,</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.839" end="00:44:50.990" style="s2">I believe pretty much everywhere it’s been<br />studied.</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.990" end="00:44:54.569" style="s2">Now, you can calculate an index called the<br />Gini coefficient.</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.569" end="00:45:00.779" style="s2">And the Gini coefficient is a number that<br />represents how much inequality of income distribution</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.779" end="00:45:03.089" style="s2">there is in a given geographical area.</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.089" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">So you could calculate a Gini coefficient<br />for a street or an area in a city, or a city,</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.780" end="00:45:13.050" style="s2">or a state, or a country, you can do it at<br />all those levels.</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.050" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">And what you find is that, you know you always<br />hear this idea that poverty causes crime.</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:20.800" style="s2">That’s a classic left-wing idea.</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.800" end="00:45:24.210" style="s2">But it’s wrong, it’s seriously wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.210" end="00:45:25.780" style="s2">And it’s importantly wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.780" end="00:45:29.450" style="s2">And it’s definitively wrong, not only that.</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.450" end="00:45:33.009" style="s2">So there’s no argument about this, it’s<br />already been established.</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.009" end="00:45:38.009" style="s2">What causes crime, especially aggressive crime,<br />is relative poverty, and relative poverty</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.009" end="00:45:40.099" style="s2">is not the same thing as poverty at all.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.099" end="00:45:42.359" style="s2">It’s seriously not the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.359" end="00:45:44.410" style="s2">Poverty is when you don’t have enough to<br />eat.</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.410" end="00:45:49.519" style="s2">Relative poverty is when the guy next door<br />has a much better car than you.</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.519" end="00:45:52.980" style="s2">And there’s lots of relative poverty in<br />the United States, and there’s some absolute</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.980" end="00:45:57.180" style="s2">poverty, but even the absolute poverty in<br />the United States is nothing like the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.180" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">poverty say in places like India or sub-Saharan<br />Africa, where absolute poverty means you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:03.480" style="s2">nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.480" end="00:46:09.430" style="s2">Now, what’s really interesting about the<br />Gini coefficient is that if you go to places</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.430" end="00:46:15.650" style="s2">where everyone, roughly speaking, is poor,<br />say by national standards…</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.650" end="00:46:21.340" style="s2">I think South Dakota was often used as an<br />example, or maybe one of the Maritime Provinces…</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.340" end="00:46:26.430" style="s2">like Newfoundland, where there’s low average<br />income but it’s pretty flat distribution,</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.430" end="00:46:29.030" style="s2">there’s almost no crime.</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.030" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">And if you go to places where everyone’s<br />rich then there’s almost no crime.</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:40.200" style="s2">But if you go places where there’s poor<br />people and moderately well-off people, and</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.200" end="00:46:45.880" style="s2">rich people, and the distribution is really<br />steep, then the rate of aggressive behaviour</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.880" end="00:46:50.470" style="s2">among young men, and it’s usually within<br />their own ethnic group, starts to sky-rocket</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.470" end="00:46:52.420" style="s2">out of control.</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.420" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">And the reason for that seems to be that,<br />if the dominance hierarchy is too steep, then</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:03.390" style="s2">the young men have no likelihood of climbing<br />to a dominant position while playing the standard</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.390" end="00:47:04.789" style="s2">social game.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.789" end="00:47:09.759" style="s2">And so what they do is turn to aggression,<br />to make their mark on the world.</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.759" end="00:47:12.039" style="s2">And it works, too, that’s the other thing.</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.039" end="00:47:17.250" style="s2">Make no mistake about it, if you’re looking<br />for status where status is hard to achieve,</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.250" end="00:47:22.750" style="s2">and you’re the meanest, toughest guy around,<br />and, you know, around a bunch of people who,</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.750" end="00:47:26.819" style="s2">like you, don’t have much money, then you’re<br />going to benefit from that status.</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.819" end="00:47:27.819" style="s2">It works.</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.819" end="00:47:28.819" style="s2">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.819" end="00:47:33.510" style="s2">Would that be part of the reason why… because<br />I know that, I think that violent crime rate</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.510" end="00:47:38.940" style="s2">in the US is higher than it is in Canada,<br />would that be part of the reason why?</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.940" end="00:47:44.420" style="s2">Sure, yeah, I mean you can make a real conservative<br />argument for making sure that, you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.420" end="00:47:48.450" style="s2">conservatives are very anti-income distribution,<br />and we figure that’s because of the guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.450" end="00:47:53.339" style="s2">that have this male independence, you know<br />they have this male independence factor, they</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.339" end="00:47:57.070" style="s2">don’t want to be distributing resources<br />to people who are down the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.070" end="00:47:59.690" style="s2">because they want them down the dominance<br />hierarchy!</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.690" end="00:48:03.849" style="s2">They want there to be a difference between<br />the people on top and the people on the bottom,</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.849" end="00:48:08.060" style="s2">so that they can be the people on top, so<br />that it increases their relative attractiveness.</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.060" end="00:48:11.170" style="s2">Like it’s a perfectly logical game.</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.170" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">And they presume that, well the rules are<br />set up, and like every man can go for it,</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:19.980" style="s2">do his best, and the winner wins and the loser<br />loses, and that’s just how it is, and “don’t</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.980" end="00:48:22.380" style="s2">ask me to fix it because I don’t want to.</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.380" end="00:48:28.569" style="s2">And besides that I find it distasteful to<br />attempt to fix it”, more than that, right,</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.569" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">because it’s a moral issue, it’s not just<br />an intellectual issue.</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:39.549" style="s2">So you can make a case, however, from the<br />conservative point of view, especially with</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.549" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">regards to, say, beliefs in religious traditionalism,<br />and the desire to maintain social stability,</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:49.480" style="s2">that you shouldn’t let income distribution<br />become too unequal.</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.480" end="00:48:53.759" style="s2">Like one of the big things your society has<br />to do is to make sure that doesn’t get out</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.759" end="00:48:58.259" style="s2">of hand, because it tends to get out of hand,<br />it tends towards a few people having everything</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.259" end="00:49:01.619" style="s2">and almost everyone else having nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.619" end="00:49:06.539" style="s2">In a sense, it’s a natural consequence of<br />economic progression, which is actually something</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.539" end="00:49:07.930" style="s2">that Marx pointed out.</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.930" end="00:49:11.900" style="s2">Although an Italian named Pareto had figured<br />it out at approximately the same time, and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.900" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">I think with a lot more conceptual clarity.</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:21.359" style="s2">But, the more unequal you let your society<br />get, the higher the probability of death,</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:24.009" style="s2">roughly speaking, through violent causes.</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.009" end="00:49:32.030" style="s2">But I’m telling you why it is that, you<br />know, men want to climb the dominance hierarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.030" end="00:49:33.940" style="s2">and the reason they want to climb the dominance<br />hierarchy is that they get access to women.</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.940" end="00:49:37.039" style="s2">I was going to, actually ask earlier in the<br />discussion, when you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.039" end="00:49:47.039" style="s2">familiar and the unfamiliar and the structure.</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.039" end="00:49:52.924" style="s2">So it seems like we all want to live within<br />a structure, but we don’t want the rules</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.924" end="00:49:53.924" style="s2">to apply to ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.924" end="00:49:56.440" style="s2">Well, we have this contradictory problem,<br />we want to be protected by the structure but</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.440" end="00:49:59.009" style="s2">we want to advance our position within it.</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.009" end="00:50:04.640" style="s2">And so that means, what that should mean,<br />and this is I think the definition of civilised</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.640" end="00:50:09.069" style="s2">behaviour, is that you’re allowed to advance<br />your position within the structure as long</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.069" end="00:50:12.530" style="s2">as you don’t disrupt it negatively.</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.530" end="00:50:14.130" style="s2">And I think that most people do do that.</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.130" end="00:50:21.079" style="s2">In fact I think people in civilised countries<br />do that so effectively that it’s an absolute,</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.079" end="00:50:23.240" style="s2">incomprehensible miracle.</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.240" end="00:50:26.930" style="s2">I can’t understand how or why it ever got<br />established.</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.930" end="00:50:31.340" style="s2">But like a psychopath will climb the ladder<br />and cut the rungs off underneath him, fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.340" end="00:50:35.710" style="s2">He doesn’t even care if the damn thing maintains<br />itself.</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.710" end="00:50:40.609" style="s2">You know, he’s perfectly willing to have<br />it destroyed after he’s exhausted it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.609" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">But if everyone acted like that or even if<br />a substantial number of people acted like</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:51.160" style="s2">that, the whole thing would come to a halt,<br />virtually in no time flat.</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.160" end="00:51:02.420" style="s2">So I mean, why… see, you might… here’s<br />a reason… you know, because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.420" end="00:51:04.980" style="s2">we were talking about is masculine violence.</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.980" end="00:51:08.789" style="s2">Now the thing about masculine violence is<br />that it only tends to emerge in situations</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.789" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">where there don’t seem to be any other reasonably<br />viable means of advancing status.</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:20.299" style="s2">So it’s not reasonable to say that men are<br />aggressive.</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.299" end="00:51:23.940" style="s2">You can say that on average men are more aggressive<br />than women.</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.940" end="00:51:30.040" style="s2">And you can also say that if you put men in<br />a situation where they have no, where they</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.040" end="00:51:36.391" style="s2">can see status differences but they have no<br />means of moving forward, that they’re likely</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.391" end="00:51:40.960" style="s2">to turn to aggression as a way of establishing<br />dominance.</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.960" end="00:51:45.789" style="s2">And then you can say that, the reason for<br />that is that it makes them more attractive,</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.789" end="00:51:47.609" style="s2">the fundamental reason.</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.609" end="00:51:48.869" style="s2">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.869" end="00:52:01.573" style="s2">Yeah, I’d just like to add on, I read this<br />article once that talks about how polygamous</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.573" end="00:52:02.573" style="s2">societies are more violent than monogamous<br />ones.</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.573" end="00:52:03.573" style="s2">Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.573" end="00:52:04.573" style="s2">I was going to say maybe it’s because when<br />one guy has two wives that means that 50%</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.573" end="00:52:05.573" style="s2">of the population has no wives, no access<br />to sex.</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.573" end="00:52:08.550" style="s2">Yeah that’s exactly right, the evolutionary<br />psychology explanation for the pathology of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.550" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">polygamy is that once you let it establish<br />itself then then men get ultra-violent.</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:18.130" style="s2">So would you say that monogamy would almost<br />be a basis for civilised society?</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.130" end="00:52:22.260" style="s2">Many people have said that, and yes I think<br />you can make a strong case for that.</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.260" end="00:52:25.660" style="s2">And I think the fundamental reason is the<br />one you just pointed out.</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.660" end="00:52:34.079" style="s2">You know the idea is, well, would you rather<br />have one woman, or die, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.079" end="00:52:38.780" style="s2">Sorry no, that’s not quite right.</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.780" end="00:52:44.259" style="s2">It’s more like, would you be willing to<br />limit yourself to one partner or have a shot</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.259" end="00:52:47.950" style="s2">at many partners but a much higher probability<br />of dying.</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.950" end="00:52:50.999" style="s2">Right, and you know, some guys will take that.</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.999" end="00:52:54.570" style="s2">They’ll take the high-risk approach.</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.570" end="00:53:00.450" style="s2">So now, this doesn’t eliminate the difference<br />in individual differences in determining who’s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.450" end="00:53:05.240" style="s2">going to be aggressive, because what will<br />happen is that as the Gini coefficient pressure</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.240" end="00:53:10.410" style="s2">rises, the more aggressive men, the men who<br />are more aggressive by nature, will get more</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.410" end="00:53:11.670" style="s2">aggressive first.</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.670" end="00:53:15.059" style="s2">So you can imagine, it’s a threshold phenomenon,<br />in some sense.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.059" end="00:53:19.720" style="s2">And what I should tell you as well is that<br />the relationship between the Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.720" end="00:53:26.490" style="s2">and male-on-male homicide isn’t 0.2 or 0.3,<br />which is the correlation that you’d get</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.490" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">if you were predicting something like that<br />using personality.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:31.599" style="s2">It’s like 0.8 or 0.9.</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.599" end="00:53:35.740" style="s2">It’s like it eats up all of it, it’s the<br />explanation.</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.740" end="00:53:40.569" style="s2">So it’s a huge effect, it’s so big an<br />effect that you can basically say that oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.569" end="00:53:41.789" style="s2">well, we figured that out.</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.789" end="00:53:45.999" style="s2">Although psychologists never know when they’ve<br />figured anything out, and they keep endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.999" end="00:53:49.640" style="s2">retesting it over and over and over, because<br />you know, we don’t know how to bring our</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.640" end="00:53:50.900" style="s2">science to a stop.</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.900" end="00:53:55.109" style="s2">But if you don’t accept the Gini coefficient-aggression<br />data, that’s like, you might as well throw</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.109" end="00:54:01.109" style="s2">the rest of social sciences out the window,<br />because the effect is unbelievably powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.109" end="00:54:03.950" style="s2">What geographical area does this take place<br />in?</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.950" end="00:54:07.970" style="s2">It depends… you can do it on any level of<br />analysis.</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.970" end="00:54:12.430" style="s2">You can do it by county, you can do it by<br />city, you can do it by state, and you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.430" end="00:54:14.940" style="s2">do it by country, and it works on all of those<br />levels</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.940" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">Student: Like, it predicts aggression, almost?</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:19.240" style="s2">You bet.</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.240" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:21.240" style="s2">And that’s a great question.</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.240" end="00:54:27.670" style="s2">I mean, the methodologically sophisticated<br />studies have done exactly that, to ensure</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.670" end="00:54:31.309" style="s2">that it’s actually this phenomenon rather<br />than other factors that might be operative</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.309" end="00:54:33.880" style="s2">in that particular geographical area.</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.880" end="00:54:38.869" style="s2">So countries with a higher Gini coefficient<br />are more violent, and cities within that country</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.869" end="00:54:42.809" style="s2">that have a higher than average Gini coefficient<br />for that country are more violent on average.</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.809" end="00:54:46.250" style="s2">It’s a very, very robust finding.</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.250" end="00:54:56.099" style="s2">Alright, so we’re going to say, for the<br />sake of argument, that you’ve got the male</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.099" end="00:54:59.869" style="s2">dominance hierarchy, and it’s represented<br />as masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.869" end="00:55:05.500" style="s2">Now, one of the things Jung said, now he thought<br />that women carried an image of men in their</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.500" end="00:55:06.549" style="s2">unconscious.</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.549" end="00:55:12.549" style="s2">And he thought that the image that women carried<br />of men in their unconscious was a group of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.549" end="00:55:14.460" style="s2">men, not an individual man.</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.460" end="00:55:17.220" style="s2">He called that the animus.</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.220" end="00:55:23.220" style="s2">Whereas he believed that the image of women<br />that men carried in their collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.220" end="00:55:26.690" style="s2">was of a single woman, and he called that<br />the anima.</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.690" end="00:55:31.690" style="s2">Now I’m just telling you that, I’m not<br />going to justify it, or even discuss it, but</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.690" end="00:55:36.190" style="s2">I just want you to keep that in the back of<br />your mind.</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.190" end="00:55:41.950" style="s2">So I guess part of the reason I’m telling<br />you that, come to think of it, is that I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.950" end="00:55:48.359" style="s2">it may provide some insight into why the idea<br />of the patriarchy has become such a well-accepted</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.359" end="00:55:50.809" style="s2">notion.</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.809" end="00:55:53.960" style="s2">Because it is an archetypal notion, but it’s<br />a one-sided archetypal notion.</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.960" end="00:55:58.170" style="s2">Okay, so back to sexual selection.</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.170" end="00:56:04.819" style="s2">Now, we already talked about the fact that<br />biologists perhaps were uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.819" end="00:56:10.130" style="s2">the idea of sexual selection, because it brings<br />a non-random factor into evolution.</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.130" end="00:56:17.499" style="s2">A seriously non-random factor, because you<br />have to go back as far as you can in history</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.499" end="00:56:23.019" style="s2">to where there was no choice, on the part<br />of the organism, to attribute evolution to</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.019" end="00:56:24.989" style="s2">natural selection alone.</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.989" end="00:56:28.680" style="s2">And you have to go back a long ways back,<br />as I said, even butterflies are perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.680" end="00:56:33.049" style="s2">capable of distinguishing between a high-quality<br />butterfly partner, in butterfly terms, and</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.049" end="00:56:34.980" style="s2">a low-quality butterfly partner.</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.980" end="00:56:40.130" style="s2">And you know, insects have been around for<br />a very, very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.130" end="00:56:45.819" style="s2">So we have no idea, what that actually means<br />is that we have no idea what role choice has</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.819" end="00:56:48.819" style="s2">made in the evolutionary process.</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.819" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">But one thing that you can infer is that the<br />reason human beings are the way they are now,</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:57:00.760" style="s2">and not like chimps or human ancestors, is<br />because the sexual selection process got started,</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.760" end="00:57:02.819" style="s2">and it was intense.</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.819" end="00:57:05.670" style="s2">And so, as a consequence of that, here we<br />are.</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.670" end="00:57:07.579" style="s2">And so, you know, maybe it was a good thing.</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.579" end="00:57:10.970" style="s2">Although it’s very hard, in some sense,<br />on all those people who failed.</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.970" end="00:57:17.730" style="s2">And that’s, you know, roughly speaking,<br />twice as many men as women.</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.730" end="00:57:23.220" style="s2">So then that all raises the question, like<br />who exactly is responsible for the male dominance</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.220" end="00:57:24.220" style="s2">hierarchy?</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.220" end="00:57:27.480" style="s2">Because you could say it’s male competitiveness,<br />but you could also say, yeah well it’s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.480" end="00:57:30.810" style="s2">inevitable function of female selection.</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.810" end="00:57:33.750" style="s2">Which is not an argument that you hear very<br />often.</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.750" end="00:57:36.119" style="s2">But I think it’s a very difficult argument<br />to escape from.</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.119" end="00:57:37.730" style="s2">And that leads us to our next hypothesis.</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.730" end="00:57:43.240" style="s2">So we’re going to say that the masculine<br />dominance hierarchy is represented as masculine.</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.240" end="00:57:45.789" style="s2">I’m going to call that The Great Father<br />for the time being.</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.789" end="00:57:51.150" style="s2">And that’s the permanent dominance hierarchy<br />of men, and it’s always there, it moves</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.150" end="00:57:52.150" style="s2">through history.</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.150" end="00:57:56.880" style="s2">It’s different men all the time, but the<br />men slot in and out as they are born and die,</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.880" end="00:58:01.109" style="s2">but the structure itself stays intact across…<br />forever.</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.109" end="00:58:02.579" style="s2">It’s always there.</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.579" end="00:58:06.810" style="s2">It’s been there at least for millions of<br />years, so for our purposes we’ll just call</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.810" end="00:58:07.810" style="s2">it permanent.</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.810" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">It’s a permanent part of experience, and<br />it’s a big part of it.</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:18.690" style="s2">And you know, as culture gets more and more…<br />covers larger and larger expanses of territory,</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.690" end="00:58:22.890" style="s2">gets more and more sophisticated, it’s an<br />ever larger part of reality.</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.890" end="00:58:30.819" style="s2">I mean, most of us spend almost all our time<br />coping with the dominance hierarchy, and almost</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.819" end="00:58:32.890" style="s2">none of our time combatting nature.</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.890" end="00:58:38.309" style="s2">You know, you get wet for a little while and<br />that’s it, you know, but most of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.309" end="00:58:44.029" style="s2">that you would face in a purely natural environment,<br />you’re so distant from them that you could</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.029" end="00:58:47.880" style="s2">hardly imagine, you can’t even imagine what<br />it would be like, in some sense, to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.880" end="00:58:48.880" style="s2">an environment like that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.880" end="00:58:49.880" style="s2">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.880" end="00:58:50.880" style="s2">I have a question.</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.880" end="00:58:51.880" style="s2">Like your explanation of what drives men to<br />become competitive and vindictive of the hierarchy…</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.880" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">what drives women?</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:53.880" style="s2">Like for example there’s an aggressive nature<br />of women and there’s some sort of competitiveness</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.880" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">in women, let’s say at the University of<br />Toronto.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:59:05.190" style="s2">So </p>
<p begin="00:59:05.190" end="00:59:09.390" style="s2">what is driving women to try to elevate their<br />level in the hierarchy?</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.390" end="00:59:10.390" style="s2">Well, that’s a good question.</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.390" end="00:59:13.720" style="s2">So the way I would answer that question is<br />two-fold.</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.720" end="00:59:19.519" style="s2">So the question was what drives women to move<br />to the top of the hierarchy?</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.519" end="00:59:24.089" style="s2">It’s something that’s worth discussing.</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.089" end="00:59:27.950" style="s2">So if anybody objects to what I’m going<br />to say, then please do, because I’m not,</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.950" end="00:59:31.099" style="s2">you know, dishing this out as received truth,<br />it’s…</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.099" end="00:59:34.410" style="s2">I’ve been trying to figure this out and<br />this is what it looks like to me.</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.410" end="00:59:37.980" style="s2">The first thing is that I think there are…<br />male and female dominance hierarchies both</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.980" end="00:59:40.279" style="s2">exist but they’re different.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.279" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">And that females compete with each other intensely,<br />but they don’t compete for the same things,</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:48.200" style="s2">and they don’t compete the same way.</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.200" end="00:59:54.780" style="s2">So let me tell you a little story, this is<br />a bit of a divergence, but it’s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.780" end="00:59:55.780" style="s2">point.</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.780" end="00:59:58.890" style="s2">And one of the questions I’ve always been<br />asked in this class… because I’m going</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.890" end="01:00:04.470" style="s2">to lay out a hero story, and the fundamental<br />hero archetype, and the hero is masculine</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.470" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">in mythology… and so the women always ask,<br />well what about the role of the woman?</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:12.089" style="s2">And it’s like, it’s very, very complex,<br />which of course, all you women already know,</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.089" end="01:00:13.839" style="s2">because it is very, very complex.</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.839" end="01:00:18.039" style="s2">But it isn’t something that… first of<br />all I don’t think it’s a question that</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.039" end="01:00:22.790" style="s2">would’ve been asked before the invention<br />of the birth control pill.</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.790" end="01:00:27.260" style="s2">Because we know what the archetypal female<br />is, prior to that.</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.260" end="01:00:30.710" style="s2">It’s the Virgin Mary with child, it’s<br />a virgin with child.</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.710" end="01:00:35.579" style="s2">Which means that the unit for woman is ‘woman<br />with child’.</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.579" end="01:00:38.099" style="s2">It’s not woman, it’s woman with child.</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.099" end="01:00:44.859" style="s2">And, well, it’s obvious why that is, because<br />as soon as you become a woman, in most societies,</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.859" end="01:00:46.260" style="s2">you have a child.</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.260" end="01:00:52.609" style="s2">Before that, you’re a girl, and that’s,<br />you know, that’s in some sense irrelevant,</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.609" end="01:00:54.390" style="s2">in terms of your destiny.</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.390" end="01:01:00.590" style="s2">Now you might say, well what’s your archetypal<br />pattern if you’re not a mother?</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.590" end="01:01:08.180" style="s2">Well, the way it looks to me is that there’s<br />two archetypes for personal development, for</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.180" end="01:01:10.170" style="s2">the personal path, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.170" end="01:01:15.970" style="s2">There’s the hero, and that would be the<br />person that explores the unknown and discovers</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.970" end="01:01:19.430" style="s2">something of value and brings it back and<br />distributes it to the community.</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.430" end="01:01:27.210" style="s2">So it’s like a hunting… it’s probably<br />predicated on a hunting platform, because</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.210" end="01:01:31.450" style="s2">our bodies are hunting platforms, basically.</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.450" end="01:01:36.170" style="s2">And one theory about what men did, which is<br />a very probable theory, is that they went</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.170" end="01:01:37.339" style="s2">out and hunted for meat.</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.339" end="01:01:40.230" style="s2">And chimps like meat, they’ll eat it whenever<br />they can, although they’re not very good</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.230" end="01:01:41.230" style="s2">hunters.</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.230" end="01:01:42.230" style="s2">But they will definitely eat meat.</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.230" end="01:01:46.519" style="s2">And human beings are so good at hunting that<br />we probably… well, for example, we probably</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.519" end="01:01:48.089" style="s2">wiped out the mammoths.</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.089" end="01:01:52.670" style="s2">And when human beings came into North America,<br />there were as many different kinds of large</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.670" end="01:01:57.359" style="s2">animal in North America as there were in Africa,<br />and human beings killed all of them.</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.359" end="01:02:03.210" style="s2">And that was just with… you know, like they<br />didn’t have our notion of technologically</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.210" end="01:02:07.220" style="s2">sophisticated weapons, it was bows and arrows<br />and clubs and spears.</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.220" end="01:02:12.180" style="s2">Nonetheless, they got rid of everything, you<br />know.</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.180" end="01:02:20.270" style="s2">Large cats, giant beavers, mammoths… we’re<br />very, very, very, very dangerous.</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.270" end="01:02:29.049" style="s2">Anyways, there’s another archetype, I would<br />say it’s a maternal archetype in a sense,</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.049" end="01:02:32.130" style="s2">and one of the things that’s very interesting<br />about human males is that they’re quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.130" end="01:02:35.769" style="s2">maternal, by comparison to other animals.</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.769" end="01:02:43.150" style="s2">So for example, the mother bear doesn’t<br />have the male bear, the boar… is it boars</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.150" end="01:02:44.450" style="s2">and sows with bears?</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.450" end="01:02:45.740" style="s2">I think it is.</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.740" end="01:02:48.599" style="s2">Anyways, you keep the cub away from the male,<br />because he’ll kill them.</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.599" end="01:02:57.359" style="s2">Now, not all males will do that but many will,<br />they don’t have any filial attachment.</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.359" end="01:03:02.440" style="s2">And that’s the case for many but not all<br />complex mammals.</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.440" end="01:03:13.160" style="s2">Pair bonding on a permanent basis is relatively<br />rare, but joint provision of children, that’s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.160" end="01:03:14.700" style="s2">exceedingly rare.</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.700" end="01:03:17.079" style="s2">And men are pretty good at taking care of<br />children.</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.079" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">I would say they’re not as good at taking<br />care of infants as women are, because they</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:23.740" style="s2">don’t have the full range of resources at<br />hand.</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.740" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">And they’re not, I don’t think they have<br />the same kind of immediate intuitive understanding</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:34.989" style="s2">of, or attraction to, babies that women have.</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.989" end="01:03:40.210" style="s2">I think that switch is around the age of two<br />or two and a half, when the kids can engage</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.210" end="01:03:42.190" style="s2">in rough-and-tumble play.</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.190" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">Because men are much more likely to engage<br />in rough-and-tumble play than women are, and</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">rough-and-tumble play seems to be one of the<br />things that civilises children.</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:54.869" style="s2">And it’s partly because, you know one of<br />the things you have to learn when you’re</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.869" end="01:04:00.339" style="s2">a child is what actually hurts you and what<br />can be ignored, and what actually hurts someone</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.339" end="01:04:02.130" style="s2">else and what can be ignored.</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.130" end="01:04:04.470" style="s2">And the best way to learn that is in rough-and-tumble<br />play.</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.470" end="01:04:08.599" style="s2">Because what happens is that if you’re playing<br />with a kid, they get more and more excited</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.599" end="01:04:12.599" style="s2">and they do more and more crazy things, until<br />they do something that either hurts them or</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.599" end="01:04:16.460" style="s2">hurts you, and then you have to say, look,<br />you can’t do that.</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.460" end="01:04:20.769" style="s2">And it’s like a dance in a sense, you know,<br />when you’re playing with a kid.</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.769" end="01:04:25.249" style="s2">And you have to let them win fairly frequently,<br />because otherwise they don’t continue the</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.249" end="01:04:26.249" style="s2">game.</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.249" end="01:04:29.700" style="s2">And you can tell that because if the game<br />is going well then they’re laughing with</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.700" end="01:04:34.299" style="s2">insane life, because kids just love rough-and-tumble<br />play.</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.299" end="01:04:39.260" style="s2">And they love crazy things and catch them<br />and they think that’s just great.</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.260" end="01:04:42.920" style="s2">But partly what you’re doing is you’re<br />extending their body in all sorts of ways</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.920" end="01:04:48.839" style="s2">and getting them to learn, in an embodied<br />sense, where their limits are and where the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.839" end="01:04:49.999" style="s2">limits of other people are.</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.999" end="01:04:50.999" style="s2">And that’s embodied.</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.999" end="01:04:55.400" style="s2">And children who haven’t had that, man they’re<br />just so awkward, it’s unbelievable.</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.400" end="01:04:59.420" style="s2">You know, they might have some hypothetical<br />sense of how to interact with another person,</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.420" end="01:05:03.230" style="s2">but they don’t have an embodied sense of<br />it, and they can’t tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.230" end="01:05:04.750" style="s2">what hurts them and what doesn’t.</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.750" end="01:05:09.410" style="s2">Because often a young child, if they’re<br />startled, they’ll start to cry.</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.410" end="01:05:13.240" style="s2">And then you can say, well that didn’t hurt,<br />and then they’ll notice, well yeah it didn’t</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.240" end="01:05:14.630" style="s2">hurt, and they’ll stop crying.</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.630" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">But if they haven’t had their limits tested,<br />they’ll cry at anything unexpected, even</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:21.319" style="s2">if it doesn’t hurt.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.319" end="01:05:26.009" style="s2">And that’s not good, because if you cry<br />under all conditions the probability that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.009" end="01:05:28.420" style="s2">you’ll make friends when you’re three<br />is zero.</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.420" end="01:05:31.950" style="s2">Because another kid will start playing with<br />you and maybe playing rough, and if you burst</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.950" end="01:05:36.749" style="s2">into tears, you know, several times, the kid’s<br />just going to go somewhere else and find a</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.749" end="01:05:37.749" style="s2">different playmate.</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.749" end="01:05:39.519" style="s2">You know, they’ll say you’re just a baby.</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.519" end="01:05:47.400" style="s2">Which is roughly, exactly accurate… roughly<br />exactly [laughter]… roughly accurate!</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.400" end="01:05:52.420" style="s2">Anyways, back to the archetypal representation.</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.420" end="01:05:58.160" style="s2">I think really the way to think about it is<br />that for men, the hero archetype is the archetype</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.160" end="01:06:03.430" style="s2">that’s dominant and in the forefront, and<br />the maternal archetype is subordinate and</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.430" end="01:06:06.309" style="s2">in the background, I mean inside their own<br />psyches.</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.309" end="01:06:08.700" style="s2">Whereas with women it’s reversed.</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.700" end="01:06:13.420" style="s2">So each of the genders can play the role of<br />the other gender but there’s a tilt in each</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.420" end="01:06:17.809" style="s2">of them towards the… what would you say?</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.809" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">Well I would say towards typical gender-normative<br />behaviour.</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:28.500" style="s2">Now the social constructivists believe that<br />no such thing exists, but those people are</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.500" end="01:06:32.650" style="s2">so pathological that even considering what<br />they have to say is a mistake.</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.650" end="01:06:39.589" style="s2">So, you know they act as if there is no biology<br />and everything’s cultural, and it’s like,</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.589" end="01:06:42.089" style="s2">well no, that’s just not right.</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.089" end="01:06:46.931" style="s2">Now what biology means in practice and what<br />you should do about it, that’s a whole different</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.931" end="01:06:51.299" style="s2">question, but to think of all these differences<br />as socially… height differences between</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.299" end="01:06:55.369" style="s2">men and women are not socially constructed,<br />and they’re relevant.</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.369" end="01:06:59.509" style="s2">And the upper-body strength differences between<br />men and women are not socially constructed,</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.509" end="01:07:02.269" style="s2">and they’re relevant too!</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.269" end="01:07:06.140" style="s2">So one of the things I was wondering about,<br />maybe you guys can help me clarify this or</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.140" end="01:07:10.579" style="s2">tell me where I’m not thinking about this<br />properly, and if you think there’s any…</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.579" end="01:07:14.299" style="s2">if I’m missing something let me know.</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.299" end="01:07:20.119" style="s2">One of the things my daughter said, she watched<br />my son one day have a fight with his best</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.119" end="01:07:21.119" style="s2">friend.</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.119" end="01:07:23.130" style="s2">It was a physical fight, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.130" end="01:07:26.310" style="s2">His best friend did something that my best<br />friend didn’t regard as appropriate and</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.310" end="01:07:29.089" style="s2">so he hit him, and then there was a fight.</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.089" end="01:07:32.249" style="s2">And then three days later they were friends<br />again.</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.249" end="01:07:37.569" style="s2">And my daughter said to me that she was very<br />annoyed by that, which wasn’t the fight</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.569" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">exactly, but the fact that they could have<br />a fight and then they were friends again three</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:46.380" style="s2">days later, because she said that that option<br />wasn’t available to women, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.380" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">And the option is, the option that the men<br />have is, “well if you get out of hand I’ll</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:56.529" style="s2">just sock you one”, and then we’ll have<br />established where the boundaries of behaviour</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.529" end="01:07:57.529" style="s2">begin and end.</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.529" end="01:08:03.829" style="s2">And I would say that in my experience, if<br />I’m talking to someone who’s self-confident</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.829" end="01:08:08.859" style="s2">and masculine and accomplished, there’s<br />always an undercurrent of potential violence.</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.859" end="01:08:10.869" style="s2">It’s an undercurrent.</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.869" end="01:08:14.130" style="s2">And that’s actually an undercurrent of respect,<br />which means that there’s things that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.130" end="01:08:18.520" style="s2">can do to each other in a civilised way, but<br />there are rules that if you break, all hell’s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.520" end="01:08:19.730" style="s2">going to break loose.</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.730" end="01:08:24.170" style="s2">And one of the consequences of that is that<br />it doesn’t.</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.170" end="01:08:30.230" style="s2">Now the typical bullying pattern for women<br />in high school and junior high is reputation</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.230" end="01:08:31.970" style="s2">destruction.</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.970" end="01:08:40.279" style="s2">And I’m wondering, what are the implications<br />for the conduct of behaviour if there is no</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.279" end="01:08:43.400" style="s2">recourse to aggression to solve disputes?</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.400" end="01:08:46.600" style="s2">Because they don’t get solved.</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.600" end="01:08:51.830" style="s2">You know, I’ve tried to analyse what it<br />means to say ‘no’ to someone, because</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.830" end="01:08:52.830" style="s2">‘no’ means something.</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.830" end="01:08:58.120" style="s2">‘No’ means… well if you tell a child<br />‘no’, what you’re basically telling</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.120" end="01:09:01.969" style="s2">the child, as far as I can tell, is if you<br />continue doing that something you won’t</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.969" end="01:09:04.020" style="s2">like will happen to you.</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.020" end="01:09:09.130" style="s2">And if you’re civilised and say no what<br />happens is you say no a couple of times and</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.130" end="01:09:13.909" style="s2">then instead of devaluing the word, which<br />is what you do if you just said it over and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.909" end="01:09:19.190" style="s2">over a hundred times with no consequences,<br />you take action that’s non-verbal.</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.190" end="01:09:23.319" style="s2">And so one of the things you might do is remove<br />the child from the situation, or you might</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.319" end="01:09:24.319" style="s2">put them on the steps.</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.319" end="01:09:27.569" style="s2">Or maybe you put them on the steps and they<br />run away, so you have to hold them on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.569" end="01:09:28.569" style="s2">steps.</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.569" end="01:09:33.859" style="s2">But the point is, the point to the child is,<br />there are limits, and if you exceed them,</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.859" end="01:09:36.759" style="s2">you will be physically controlled.</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.759" end="01:09:40.549" style="s2">What if there’s no option for physical control?</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.549" end="01:09:41.549" style="s2">What happens?</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.549" end="01:09:46.049" style="s2">Well I don’t know the answer to that, I<br />don’t know what women do about that but</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.049" end="01:09:49.719" style="s2">I also don’t know what men do about that<br />in relationship to women.</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.719" end="01:09:52.810" style="s2">So I was watching something the other day,<br />it was this…</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.810" end="01:09:59.900" style="s2">I posted it on my Twitter account as an example<br />of animus possession.</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.900" end="01:10:03.400" style="s2">So a woman and a man were having a dispute<br />on the street.</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.400" end="01:10:04.400" style="s2">It was a political dispute.</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.400" end="01:10:10.110" style="s2">And this particular woman, the way she was<br />behaving towards this particular man, was</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.110" end="01:10:15.460" style="s2">such that had she been a man, and had he been<br />a man, he would have definitely hit her.</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.460" end="01:10:19.739" style="s2">Because she was right in his face, and she<br />was cursing at him and swearing and calling</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.739" end="01:10:20.739" style="s2">him an idiot.</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.739" end="01:10:21.739" style="s2">And really being hyper-aggressive.</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.739" end="01:10:24.400" style="s2">And of course, he couldn’t do anything about<br />it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.400" end="01:10:28.110" style="s2">So then I was watching that and I was thinking,<br />just exactly what are you supposed to do in</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.110" end="01:10:29.349" style="s2">a situation like that?</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.349" end="01:10:31.500" style="s2">Because you’re screwed no matter what you<br />do.</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.500" end="01:10:36.260" style="s2">If you’re on the male side, it’s like,<br />you certainly can’t intervene physically.</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.260" end="01:10:41.239" style="s2">It’s like you’re dead in the water instantly,<br />instantly, in your eyes, the eyes of society,</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.239" end="01:10:44.650" style="s2">and in the woman’s eyes, instantly, if you<br />move past the boundary.</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.650" end="01:10:50.369" style="s2">If you leave, well, there’s no glory in<br />running away, that’s for sure.</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.369" end="01:10:53.770" style="s2">So what exactly is supposed to happen?</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.770" end="01:10:57.770" style="s2">I have no idea what’s supposed to happen<br />in a situation like that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.770" end="01:11:01.489" style="s2">I think what happens, what will happen over<br />time, is that men just won’t put themselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.489" end="01:11:02.489" style="s2">in those situations.</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.489" end="01:11:09.030" style="s2">I think what the male would have to do in<br />that situation is behave like a woman would,</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.030" end="01:11:15.599" style="s2">in a female dominance hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.599" end="01:11:20.000" style="s2">So he stands there and takes it and afterwards<br />goes off and bad-mouths her to her social</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.000" end="01:11:21.000" style="s2">circle.</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.000" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">That’s a form of aggression.</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:28.020" style="s2">Right, right, but you know that’s definitely<br />not seen as an admirable form of behaviour</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.020" end="01:11:29.770" style="s2">among men.</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.770" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">I mean, I don’t think it’s an admirable<br />form of behaviour, period.</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:35.264" style="s2">But I mean, you know, aggression is often<br />not admirable, so that’s fine.</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.264" end="01:11:36.264" style="s2">Yeah?</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.264" end="01:11:37.264" style="s2">I think that when you take away emotion, like<br />when someone’s acting really aggressively</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.264" end="01:11:41.659" style="s2">towards you and you reserve your emotion,<br />it gives them a lot less to feed off of, and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.659" end="01:11:55.000" style="s2">that ends up taking power away in a similar<br />way that aggression does.</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.000" end="01:11:59.280" style="s2">Because people react aggressively and they<br />want feedback that gives them more excitement…</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.280" end="01:12:00.280" style="s2">Oh definitely.</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.280" end="01:12:02.670" style="s2">Oh yeah it would’ve been a real victory<br />for her if she would’ve gotten slapped.</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.670" end="01:12:06.800" style="s2">Absolutely, because it would prove everything<br />she said instantly.</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.800" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">Yeah, but when you dismiss, power’s gone.</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:13.420" style="s2">So then you have all the power.</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.420" end="01:12:14.420" style="s2">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.420" end="01:12:19.500" style="s2">Well I think that that would be a reasonably<br />effective strategy for a street confrontation</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.500" end="01:12:20.500" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.500" end="01:12:25.820" style="s2">I’m not so sure how well it would work in<br />a prolonged competition inside a company,</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.820" end="01:12:26.920" style="s2">for example.</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.920" end="01:12:34.260" style="s2">In a hierarchy, yeah, because you know the<br />truth of the matter is that men have no idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.260" end="01:12:36.449" style="s2">how to treat women if they’re in male power<br />hierarchies.</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.449" end="01:12:39.219" style="s2">They have no idea how to treat them.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.219" end="01:12:41.179" style="s2">And that’s because we have no idea how to<br />do that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.179" end="01:12:42.750" style="s2">No one has any idea how to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.750" end="01:12:52.860" style="s2">It’s only been happening, in any pronounced<br />sense, for about, well, on a societal level,</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.860" end="01:12:54.400" style="s2">really probably since the mid-70s.</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.400" end="01:12:56.300" style="s2">You know, it’s three generations.</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.300" end="01:12:58.579" style="s2">It’s a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.579" end="01:13:01.510" style="s2">And it’s a very, very difficult thing to<br />sort out.</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.510" end="01:13:05.361" style="s2">So, I mean part of the reason I’ve been<br />thinking about these sorts of things is because</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.361" end="01:13:10.420" style="s2">I’ve been very interested in the fact that<br />men have been doing very badly in junior high</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.420" end="01:13:13.619" style="s2">and high school, and they’re bailing out<br />of universities like mad.</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.619" end="01:13:17.900" style="s2">At the rate it’s going there’ll be almost<br />no men in most disciplines within ten years.</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.900" end="01:13:20.989" style="s2">I mean you can tell that even in this class.</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.989" end="01:13:26.679" style="s2">It’s funny because on my YouTube videos<br />I look at the gender distribution for viewing</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.679" end="01:13:30.610" style="s2">and it’s 80% male, which is interesting<br />to me.</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.610" end="01:13:32.920" style="s2">I’m not sure exactly why that is.</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.920" end="01:13:39.820" style="s2">But in lots of fields it’s 80:20 women already,<br />and I can’t see why that won’t…</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.820" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">I think that’ll accelerate as we move forward,<br />rather than slowing down.</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:52.780" style="s2">Alright, so anyways, back to sexual selection<br />and the power hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.780" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">Now from a Darwinian perspective, one of the<br />things you might do is call whatever selects</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:04.199" style="s2">‘nature’.</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.199" end="01:14:09.020" style="s2">And so when we think of nature and we think<br />about nature from a scientific perspective,</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.020" end="01:14:13.719" style="s2">we don’t even think about humans as agents<br />of nature, right?</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.719" end="01:14:17.190" style="s2">We tend to think of the human being as something<br />that stands against nature.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.190" end="01:14:18.389" style="s2">That’s in mythology.</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.389" end="01:14:24.150" style="s2">It’s like, the human being against the natural<br />world, it’s a very common plot in movies</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.150" end="01:14:25.719" style="s2">and stories.</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.719" end="01:14:28.790" style="s2">So it’s man against nature, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.790" end="01:14:33.239" style="s2">So we tend to think of those as separate categories.</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.239" end="01:14:42.630" style="s2">But if women do the selection among human<br />beings, at least they do the intense selection,</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.630" end="01:14:46.369" style="s2">then women are nature, for men.</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.369" end="01:14:48.530" style="s2">And that’s exactly what the archetype is.</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.530" end="01:14:50.410" style="s2">It’s Mother Nature.</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.410" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">And Mother Nature has a very vicious element,<br />and the vicious element of Mother Nature is</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:14:57.510" style="s2">rejection.</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.510" end="01:15:01.400" style="s2">And that can be maternal rejection, which<br />is, you know, certainly something that causes</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.400" end="01:15:03.340" style="s2">a tremendous amount of trauma.</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.340" end="01:15:11.550" style="s2">But it can also be the most fundamental form<br />of rejection, and the most fundamental form</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.550" end="01:15:14.290" style="s2">of rejection is sexual rejection.</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.290" end="01:15:23.240" style="s2">Because it means that you are judged as biologically<br />unworthy, roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.240" end="01:15:27.190" style="s2">And there’s other reasons why… so the<br />reason I’m telling you this is because I’ve</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.190" end="01:15:32.900" style="s2">been trying to puzzle out… what you see<br />in mythology quite clearly is that the dominance</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.900" end="01:15:36.760" style="s2">hierarchy is represented as male, so culture<br />is male, and nature is female.</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.760" end="01:15:38.650" style="s2">Well, why the hell would nature be female?</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.650" end="01:15:42.260" style="s2">It’s like, okay, well I’ve given you one<br />reason, and I think it’s the primary reason.</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.260" end="01:15:48.210" style="s2">There’s other reasons, because nature is<br />also seen as that which produces natural forms,</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.210" end="01:15:54.030" style="s2">and of course, women produce natural forms,<br />so that’s a logical association.</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.030" end="01:15:59.070" style="s2">And then, what’s the other one?</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.070" end="01:16:08.250" style="s2">Well, we can leave it at that for the time<br />being.</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.250" end="01:16:23.179" style="s2">So, now let me show you how </p>
<p begin="01:16:23.179" end="01:16:24.920" style="s2">I think that that’s represented.</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.920" end="01:16:29.860" style="s2">I think this is the way the world is structured<br />when you consider it as a place of action.</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.860" end="01:16:35.420" style="s2">So the world as a place of action has characters,<br />like the elements are characters, and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.420" end="01:16:41.679" style="s2">characters are engaged in dramatic behaviour.</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.679" end="01:16:47.719" style="s2">And there are classes of characters, and as<br />far as I can tell, this is a reasonably comprehensive</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.719" end="01:16:49.790" style="s2">classification of dramatic characters.</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.790" end="01:16:54.420" style="s2">We’ll start from the inside and go out.</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.420" end="01:16:58.150" style="s2">And you can think of any of these as primary,<br />by the way, and you’ll see that reflected</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.150" end="01:16:59.560" style="s2">in different kinds of mythology.</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.560" end="01:17:05.030" style="s2">So sometimes the maternal is primary, and<br />sometimes the culture is primary, and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.030" end="01:17:07.090" style="s2">the hero, the individual is primary.</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.090" end="01:17:12.550" style="s2">And I think that’s because these three things<br />are irreducibly primary.</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.550" end="01:17:17.860" style="s2">In that, from the perspective of consciousness,<br />in that, to be conscious, there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.860" end="01:17:23.060" style="s2">you, but if you’re conscious you have to<br />have evolved within a culture and that’s</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.060" end="01:17:28.520" style="s2">culture is necessarily nested in the natural<br />world, and so wherever there’s one there’s</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.520" end="01:17:29.900" style="s2">all three.</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.900" end="01:17:34.290" style="s2">And the individual’s also the thing… without<br />the individual there wouldn’t be any separation</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.290" end="01:17:35.710" style="s2">between nature and culture.</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.710" end="01:17:39.980" style="s2">So you can see the individual consciousness<br />is the generator of the entire structure,</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.980" end="01:17:42.310" style="s2">but you can say that about any of the characters.</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.310" end="01:17:48.810" style="s2">So there’s the archetypal son, because the<br />hero tends to be masculine, and then, it has</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.810" end="01:17:53.449" style="s2">a… that character has a positive element<br />and a negative element.</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.449" end="01:17:59.670" style="s2">And the positive element is the good person,<br />and the negative element is the bad person.</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.670" end="01:18:06.570" style="s2">And I would say the archetypal representations<br />of those are, like, the saviour, and Satan.</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.570" end="01:18:12.429" style="s2">And that’s basically… there are portrayals<br />like that in virtually every system of mythology</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.429" end="01:18:13.429" style="s2">and religion.</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.429" end="01:18:17.950" style="s2">Now it seems to me that in some sense Christianity,<br />and this was probably under the influence</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.950" end="01:18:27.360" style="s2">of the Zoroastrians, developed the most articulated<br />representation of good vs. evil at the individual</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.360" end="01:18:29.820" style="s2">level.</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.820" end="01:18:35.719" style="s2">And that’s why you can identify two fundamental<br />characters in the Christian story, so to speak,</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.719" end="01:18:36.760" style="s2">that play out these roles.</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.760" end="01:18:41.650" style="s2">And they’re seen as eternal adversaries<br />locked in battle across time.</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.650" end="01:18:45.280" style="s2">And that would be, the battle takes place<br />in the natural world, the battle takes place</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.280" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">in the cultural world, and the battle takes<br />place within, as well.</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:54.091" style="s2">And you can see that reflected in stories<br />all the time, because, you know, it’s so</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.091" end="01:19:00.300" style="s2">frequently the case that the hero, the super-hero<br />has his nemesis.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.300" end="01:19:05.739" style="s2">And it’s the guy that he’s extraordinarily<br />well-matched with who continuously tests his</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.739" end="01:19:09.440" style="s2">wits and whose motivation is essentially destructive.</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.440" end="01:19:13.340" style="s2">So you see that with Batman and the Joker,<br />for example, or you see that with Sherlock</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.340" end="01:19:15.969" style="s2">Holmes and Moriarty.</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.969" end="01:19:23.210" style="s2">There’s always this pairing and that’s<br />partly because I think the archetypal realms</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.210" end="01:19:27.720" style="s2">of human decision-making are something like,<br />are you working to make things better or are</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.720" end="01:19:29.320" style="s2">you working to make things worse?</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.320" end="01:19:33.619" style="s2">Are you possessed by resentment and hatred,<br />so that you want things to degenerate and</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.619" end="01:19:40.590" style="s2">burn, or are you hopeful and capable of manifesting<br />faith in the future so that you’re working</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.590" end="01:19:42.130" style="s2">to make things better?</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.130" end="01:19:46.800" style="s2">And then there’s a battle in everyone, in<br />their own psyches, and then there’s a battle</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.800" end="01:19:47.800" style="s2">in culture.</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.800" end="01:19:51.520" style="s2">There’s a battle everywhere between those<br />two fundamental perspectives.</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.520" end="01:19:57.429" style="s2">And then the archetypal son is the son of<br />the Great Father, and the Great Father represents</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.429" end="01:20:00.179" style="s2">two things, order and tyranny.</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.179" end="01:20:05.989" style="s2">So there’s the hero and the adversary, at<br />the individual level, and at the social level</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.989" end="01:20:07.590" style="s2">there’s order and tyranny.</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.590" end="01:20:13.150" style="s2">And so, roughly speaking, that’s either<br />the wise king or the despot.</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.150" end="01:20:17.020" style="s2">And the despot is someone who tries to eat<br />his own sons, which is actually a fairly common</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.020" end="01:20:18.790" style="s2">mythological trope.</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.790" end="01:20:23.540" style="s2">And you know, you’re under the thumb of<br />the despot when you’re not allowed, really,</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.540" end="01:20:26.060" style="s2">either to be hero or adversary.</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.060" end="01:20:32.790" style="s2">You’re just a cog in the structure of the<br />social world.</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.790" end="01:20:34.280" style="s2">So that’s despotism.</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.280" end="01:20:40.369" style="s2">On the orderly side, well, culture is what<br />we’re sitting in right now.</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.369" end="01:20:43.679" style="s2">I mean, this is social order that encapsulates<br />us.</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.679" end="01:20:44.760" style="s2">Everything about it is social order.</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.760" end="01:20:50.719" style="s2">I mean, there are rows, they’re roughly<br />linear, you know everyone’s in their place,</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.719" end="01:20:56.260" style="s2">everyone knows what to do, we’re unbelievably<br />protected from virtually anything you could</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.260" end="01:20:58.199" style="s2">possibly imagine.</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.199" end="01:21:03.790" style="s2">And so you know, we’re in our father’s<br />living room, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.790" end="01:21:11.130" style="s2">And in that living room, it’s a safe space…<br />oh God I should never have said that… [laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.130" end="01:21:17.280" style="s2">anyways, it’s a well-protected space in<br />which people are able to play and explore.</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.280" end="01:21:24.500" style="s2">And it seems to me that one of the functions<br />that fathers play in a family, if they’re</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.500" end="01:21:28.220" style="s2">fulfilling their function properly, is that<br />what they do is they put a perimeter around</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.220" end="01:21:33.550" style="s2">the territory, so that inside the walls, so<br />to speak, it’s safe, and inside the safe</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.550" end="01:21:35.530" style="s2">walls the children can play and explore.</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.530" end="01:21:38.900" style="s2">And in their playing and exploring they develop<br />their own individuality.</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.900" end="01:21:43.090" style="s2">And so, you know, you keep the darkness at<br />bay, and you can certainly see that that’s</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.090" end="01:21:46.810" style="s2">what the children want, because as soon as<br />you put them in a dark room, the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.810" end="01:21:52.490" style="s2">they say is, you know, come chase the monsters<br />away out from underneath the bed.</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.490" end="01:21:56.860" style="s2">And you know they wouldn’t be thinking that<br />if they hadn’t had an extraordinarily long</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.860" end="01:22:01.639" style="s2">evolutionary history of being chased by monsters<br />in the dark.</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.639" end="01:22:05.630" style="s2">And there are monsters in the dark, and everyone<br />knows that.</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.630" end="01:22:11.770" style="s2">Which is why you tell your children not to<br />go play at night after it’s dark, even now.</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.770" end="01:22:17.190" style="s2">So order and tyranny are the representations<br />of culture.</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.190" end="01:22:21.380" style="s2">And the thing is that there’s a constant<br />interplay between those two because you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.380" end="01:22:26.590" style="s2">never tell exactly when order has gone too<br />far and become tyranny.</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.590" end="01:22:32.679" style="s2">Andy you can never tell really when there’s<br />so little order that, well the next thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.679" end="01:22:35.710" style="s2">happens which is the emergence of chaos.</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.710" end="01:22:37.870" style="s2">And chaos is the Great Mother.</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.870" end="01:22:39.860" style="s2">And it’s creative and destructive.</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.860" end="01:22:44.940" style="s2">And that’s nature itself.</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.940" end="01:22:48.179" style="s2">And then on the outside, the very outside,<br />and this is the most complicated category</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.179" end="01:22:53.440" style="s2">of all, is that, it’s the dragon of chaos,<br />and it represents something that’s very</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.440" end="01:22:54.440" style="s2">difficult to conceptualise.</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.440" end="01:23:03.179" style="s2">But it’s the un-configured substructure<br />of being that gives rise to these other categories.</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.179" end="01:23:09.389" style="s2">So Donald Rumsfeld at one point made a very<br />famous comment, it became famous because it</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.389" end="01:23:10.610" style="s2">fits an archetypal structure.</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.610" end="01:23:14.440" style="s2">He said that there are known unknowns and<br />unknown unknowns.</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.440" end="01:23:18.719" style="s2">Okay, the dragon of chaos is the unknown unknown.</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.719" end="01:23:23.310" style="s2">It’s so unknown that you don’t even know<br />it’s there, but it can raise its head at</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.310" end="01:23:24.330" style="s2">any given point.</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.330" end="01:23:27.860" style="s2">It’s the thing that leaps out of you in<br />the darkness.</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.860" end="01:23:30.860" style="s2">It’s like, is it Zika, is that the new virus?</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.860" end="01:23:32.710" style="s2">It’s like the Zika virus.</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.710" end="01:23:34.420" style="s2">It’s like, no one saw it coming.</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.420" end="01:23:38.070" style="s2">It’s a completely new manifestation of being.</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.070" end="01:23:44.810" style="s2">And so, known unknowns you can make plans<br />to circumvent, unknown unknowns, they’re</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.810" end="01:23:45.810" style="s2">completely unpredictable.</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.810" end="01:23:50.190" style="s2">And what’s so interesting, this is where<br />it’s so bloody complicated, because you</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.190" end="01:23:59.650" style="s2">really have to think about things differently<br />to grasp what this means.</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.650" end="01:24:03.320" style="s2">This is part of the reason why I had trouble<br />with this section of the course on alchemy,</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.320" end="01:24:09.300" style="s2">because it’s so complicated that it’s…<br />okay, so here, think of it this way.</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.300" end="01:24:11.530" style="s2">What is the unknown made of?</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.530" end="01:24:15.300" style="s2">That’s a pretty weird question.</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.300" end="01:24:18.450" style="s2">So I’ll try to walk you through it, and<br />we won’t get very far with this, because</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.450" end="01:24:23.590" style="s2">we’ll have to do it 15 or 20 times I think<br />before it starts to become something that</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.590" end="01:24:25.219" style="s2">you can grapple with.</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.219" end="01:24:30.840" style="s2">Alright, so it’s September 11, 2011 and<br />the Twin Towers have just fallen.</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.840" end="01:24:34.880" style="s2">Sorry, 2001, yes, 9/11.</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.880" end="01:24:37.909" style="s2">Alright, what’s emerged?</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.909" end="01:24:39.929" style="s2">What’s happened?</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.929" end="01:24:46.840" style="s2">Well, one answer to that is that the towers<br />fell, but it’s a very, very poor answer.</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.840" end="01:24:52.869" style="s2">Because that was an unknown unknown, I would<br />say, and it traumatised people.</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.869" end="01:24:56.640" style="s2">I mean everyone, even in Toronto, walked around<br />in shock for about two days after that.</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.640" end="01:25:00.410" style="s2">And the reason for that was that we didn&#39;t<br />know what fell.</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.410" end="01:25:04.829" style="s2">The buildings fell, but the thing is the buildings<br />aren’t isolated.</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.829" end="01:25:09.141" style="s2">Like, they’re not some abandoned buildings<br />standing out there in the middle of a field</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.141" end="01:25:13.310" style="s2">in a barren wasteland in the middle of an<br />abandoned country.</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.310" end="01:25:15.090" style="s2">They weren’t buildings, exactly.</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.090" end="01:25:17.820" style="s2">They were only buildings at a superficial<br />level.</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.820" end="01:25:23.440" style="s2">First of all they had 5000 people in them,<br />or 5000 people died, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.440" end="01:25:28.750" style="s2">And then all those people were networked out<br />with all sorts of other people.</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.750" end="01:25:30.340" style="s2">And they were networked at multiple levels.</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.340" end="01:25:35.900" style="s2">So they were family members but they were<br />also elements of the financial and economic</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.900" end="01:25:36.900" style="s2">machine.</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.900" end="01:25:40.300" style="s2">And in the political machine.</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.300" end="01:25:46.130" style="s2">And then what was hit was of course, not just<br />the buildings, but the economic and political</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.130" end="01:25:48.520" style="s2">system, whatever that means.</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.520" end="01:25:54.329" style="s2">And of course the people who took the towers<br />down weren’t trying to knock buildings down,</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.329" end="01:25:59.639" style="s2">which is what you saw happen, they were trying<br />to knock down the things the buildings invisibly</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.639" end="01:26:01.179" style="s2">related to.</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.179" end="01:26:04.860" style="s2">And then you might ask well, what were those<br />buildings invisibly related to?</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.860" end="01:26:08.650" style="s2">And it’s a simpler question to actually<br />reverse the question and ask, well what weren’t</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.650" end="01:26:10.310" style="s2">they related to?</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.310" end="01:26:14.619" style="s2">And the reason that people were traumatised<br />in the aftermath was because when we, when</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.619" end="01:26:21.810" style="s2">our bodies, in some sense, answered that question,<br />the answer was, uh oh, those buildings were</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.810" end="01:26:25.679" style="s2">probably attached to everything in every possible<br />way.</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.679" end="01:26:29.810" style="s2">And so God only knows what’s going to come<br />leaping out of that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.810" end="01:26:37.040" style="s2">So what happens when you see the buildings<br />fall, the facts that you see the buildings</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.040" end="01:26:39.770" style="s2">fall actually blinds you to what’s happening.</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.770" end="01:26:43.690" style="s2">It’s a very peripheral representation of<br />the actual event.</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.690" end="01:26:48.030" style="s2">Because you could also say, well it was a<br />psychological event, you know, it echoed inside</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.030" end="01:26:49.030" style="s2">of you.</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.030" end="01:26:52.230" style="s2">Well, you don’t see that, you feel it, and<br />you don’t really know what it means.</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.230" end="01:26:58.240" style="s2">But it puts a wave of uncertainty, a radical<br />wave of uncertainty, into everything.</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.240" end="01:27:01.270" style="s2">And not only the present, but also the future<br />for sure.</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.270" end="01:27:05.130" style="s2">Because things took a vicious turn after that,<br />and almost immediately, right?</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.130" end="01:27:09.960" style="s2">The whole political system readjusted itself,<br />it became much more authoritarian.</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.960" end="01:27:12.520" style="s2">You know, airports became little fascist enclaves.</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.520" end="01:27:16.560" style="s2">You know for me, for many people, I could<br />hardly go into an airport.</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.560" end="01:27:23.850" style="s2">It just drove me crazy to be lined up like<br />that and then subject to search, you know,</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.850" end="01:27:30.000" style="s2">by faceless representations of the paranoid<br />state.</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.000" end="01:27:33.050" style="s2">God, that’s a horrible thing to have to<br />encounter.</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.050" end="01:27:36.550" style="s2">It’s a bloody horrible thing to train people<br />to get accustomed to.</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.550" end="01:27:39.329" style="s2">It’s really dangerous to train people to<br />accept that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.329" end="01:27:44.679" style="s2">It was a way worse consequence I think, than<br />the buildings falling down themselves.</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.679" end="01:27:46.880" style="s2">But that was one thing that happened.</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.880" end="01:27:47.880" style="s2">What else happened?</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.880" end="01:27:55.520" style="s2">Well the one trillion dollar surplus that<br />was projected by the Clintons at the end of</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.520" end="01:28:00.510" style="s2">Bill Clinton’s presidency, which was the<br />prediction for the next ten years, that the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.510" end="01:28:07.780" style="s2">economy was doing so well that the US government<br />was going to have a one trillion surplus over</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.780" end="01:28:12.670" style="s2">the next ten years, turned into a four trillion<br />dollar deficit.</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.670" end="01:28:14.900" style="s2">So that happened.</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.900" end="01:28:20.421" style="s2">Well and then we got tangled up even worse<br />in the Middle East, and of course that, I</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.421" end="01:28:23.449" style="s2">think that’s probably got worse as time’s<br />gone on rather than better.</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.449" end="01:28:26.120" style="s2">And we have no idea where that’s going to<br />end.</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.120" end="01:28:30.179" style="s2">You know, I mean Russia’s involved now,<br />and Russia rattled nuclear weapons at Turkey</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.179" end="01:28:31.179" style="s2">the other day.</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.179" end="01:28:36.090" style="s2">You know, even though Turkey’s their largest<br />trading partner and a member of NATO.</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.090" end="01:28:40.410" style="s2">And then you know, a million refugees flooded<br />into Europe, and God only knows what’s going</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.410" end="01:28:43.530" style="s2">to happen as a consequence of that.</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.530" end="01:28:46.909" style="s2">And it’s not like the people who planned<br />the bomb didn’t know that, like here’s</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.909" end="01:28:48.080" style="s2">what they thought.</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.080" end="01:28:53.489" style="s2">They thought “oh, the Soviet Union, that<br />was the second greatest power on Earth, and</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.489" end="01:28:55.880" style="s2">then they waded into Afghanistan.</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.880" end="01:28:58.230" style="s2">And they got tangled up in a terrorist war<br />and oh, poof!</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.230" end="01:29:00.770" style="s2">Ten years later they didn’t exist.</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.770" end="01:29:03.040" style="s2">Maybe we could do the same thing to the United<br />States”.</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.040" end="01:29:06.440" style="s2">It’s like, well, who knows?</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.440" end="01:29:07.889" style="s2">Maybe you could.</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.889" end="01:29:15.190" style="s2">I mean they certainly… the response to the<br />9/11 disaster, in my opinion, was much more</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.190" end="01:29:17.270" style="s2">expensive than the disaster itself.</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.270" end="01:29:24.760" style="s2">I mean, one of the things that’s quite horrifying<br />is that here’s one statistic: nobody flew</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.760" end="01:29:27.430" style="s2">in the aftermath of 9/11 for a while.</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.430" end="01:29:31.850" style="s2">Like airplane flight bookings were way down.</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.850" end="01:29:36.700" style="s2">More people died in car accidents (because<br />of not flying) than were killed in the bombings.</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.700" end="01:29:40.490" style="s2">And no one ever noticed that, because people<br />are being killed on the highway all the time,</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.490" end="01:29:41.490" style="s2">right?</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.490" end="01:29:43.179" style="s2">I mean it’s background noise as far as we’re<br />concerned.</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.179" end="01:29:49.340" style="s2">But you know, it’s a really good example<br />of how not only do you not know what the event</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.340" end="01:29:53.300" style="s2">is, you can’t even tell who the event killed.</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.300" end="01:29:58.599" style="s2">And so it’s your apprehension of that, when<br />it occurs, that paralyses you.</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.599" end="01:30:01.280" style="s2">And so that’s the dragon of chaos, roughly<br />speaking.</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.280" end="01:30:02.579" style="s2">That’s an unknown unknown.</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.579" end="01:30:08.719" style="s2">It’s like all of reality, all of the multiple<br />levels of reality that exist around you are</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.719" end="01:30:13.170" style="s2">all of a sudden altered in an incomprehensible<br />manner.</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.170" end="01:30:18.390" style="s2">And then you could say that well, what happened<br />was the alteration of that reality.</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.390" end="01:30:19.969" style="s2">This is what happened.</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.969" end="01:30:25.829" style="s2">It’s that you can only perceive it, essentially,<br />as the explosion in the building and the consequent</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.829" end="01:30:26.829" style="s2">collapse.</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.829" end="01:30:30.739" style="s2">And so you might say that the Twin Towers<br />were brought down.</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.739" end="01:30:36.150" style="s2">It’s like that’s such a low-resolution<br />representation of what happened that it barely</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.150" end="01:30:40.900" style="s2">begins to describe that event.</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.900" end="01:30:46.800" style="s2">And so it’s that invisible background of<br />complex interrelationships, like a very, very</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.800" end="01:30:49.560" style="s2">complex melody, that’s always going on around<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.560" end="01:30:51.660" style="s2">And as long as it works you don’t even notice<br />it.</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.660" end="01:30:57.920" style="s2">What happens is that it manifests itself as<br />predictable and desirable order.</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.920" end="01:31:02.510" style="s2">Which you can understand, and which is the<br />reason we have predictable and desirable order.</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.510" end="01:31:06.810" style="s2">This room is configured so that you can walk<br />into it without being afraid.</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.810" end="01:31:10.520" style="s2">And what that means is that it’s a radically<br />simplified version of reality.</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.520" end="01:31:15.750" style="s2">You know, and you can see that, I mean, it’s<br />even got padded walls, and that’s to stop</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.750" end="01:31:18.310" style="s2">the sound bouncing so that it won’t annoy<br />you.</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.310" end="01:31:23.550" style="s2">You know I mean it’s warm, it’s comfortable,<br />it’s sort of neutral so it fades into the</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.550" end="01:31:24.650" style="s2">background.</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.650" end="01:31:27.750" style="s2">Everyone here is civilised beyond belief.</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.750" end="01:31:30.719" style="s2">You hear about the radical individualism of<br />the West…</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.719" end="01:31:34.520" style="s2">I think of all the nonsense I’ve ever heard<br />that’s got to be the most nonsensical, we’re</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.520" end="01:31:37.980" style="s2">so bloody obedient that it’s insane.</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.980" end="01:31:43.219" style="s2">If you go to Edmonton at 3 o’clock in the<br />morning and watch pedestrians, they will stop</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.219" end="01:31:47.730" style="s2">at the ‘don’t walk’ light and wait until<br />it turns green [laughter].</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.730" end="01:31:52.310" style="s2">Now the roads are wide and so they… but<br />it’s still the case.</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.310" end="01:31:54.060" style="s2">It’s like, really??</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.060" end="01:31:55.880" style="s2">You think you’re an individual, really?</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.880" end="01:31:59.390" style="s2">And I’m not complaining about it, I think<br />it’s an amazing thing because you know we</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.390" end="01:32:03.110" style="s2">can really zip cars through our cities because<br />people don’t run out into the middle of</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.110" end="01:32:07.210" style="s2">the streets and get killed, they stay where<br />they’re supposed to so it’s incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.210" end="01:32:08.280" style="s2">efficient.</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.280" end="01:32:14.530" style="s2">But we’re so obedient and well-behaved that<br />it’s beyond… if you think about us as</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.530" end="01:32:18.719" style="s2">chimpanzees with clothes, you know, we’re<br />doing pretty damn well.</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.719" end="01:32:22.909" style="s2">And we set up our environments so that they’re<br />so simplified that we never have to encounter</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.909" end="01:32:32.020" style="s2">this multi-dimensional layered reality of<br />patterns that’s just moving around us all</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.020" end="01:32:34.130" style="s2">the time and that actually makes up reality.</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.130" end="01:32:37.949" style="s2">That’s reality, that’s what the world<br />is made out of.</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.949" end="01:32:41.900" style="s2">That’s a way different way of thinking about<br />it than to think of the world as made up of,</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.900" end="01:32:42.920" style="s2">say, of atoms.</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.920" end="01:32:49.099" style="s2">Because you think, that way you just think,<br />well it’s marbles in space, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.099" end="01:32:53.360" style="s2">And of course atoms aren’t marbles, and<br />everyone knows that, like God only knows what</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.360" end="01:32:54.360" style="s2">they are.</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.360" end="01:32:57.140" style="s2">But that’s still the image, that’s still<br />the metaphor, of reality.</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.140" end="01:32:58.980" style="s2">But that’s not what reality is.</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.980" end="01:33:07.429" style="s2">It’s an insanely patterned orchestra of<br />phenomena and that’s really what it is and</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.429" end="01:33:12.550" style="s2">then what happens is that you’re in this<br />little orderly sub-compartment in the middle.</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.550" end="01:33:14.969" style="s2">It’s like, you’re in a box and the box<br />is in a box.</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.969" end="01:33:16.020" style="s2">Well, let’s think about it.</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.020" end="01:33:20.340" style="s2">You’re in a box, okay, this box is in a<br />building, that’s a box.</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.340" end="01:33:22.639" style="s2">The building is in the university, that’s<br />a box.</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.639" end="01:33:24.840" style="s2">The university is in the city, that’s a<br />box.</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.840" end="01:33:27.790" style="s2">The city is in the province, that’s a box.</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.790" end="01:33:32.409" style="s2">Then it’s in Canada, then it’s covered<br />by the American nuclear umbrella, you know,</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.409" end="01:33:37.210" style="s2">and then it’s embedded in this immense history<br />of individual rights and freedoms that have</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.210" end="01:33:41.199" style="s2">manifested themselves as part of the political<br />and economic order.</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.199" end="01:33:46.219" style="s2">And all of that’s going on around you and<br />people are working like mad, crazily, to keep</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.219" end="01:33:52.050" style="s2">all of those boxes intact, and here you are<br />sitting and thinking, well, what you see around</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.050" end="01:33:53.050" style="s2">you is reality.</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.050" end="01:33:58.690" style="s2">It’s like it is, yeah, but man, there’s<br />a lot of people making this reality so simple</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.690" end="01:34:00.889" style="s2">that you don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.889" end="01:34:06.840" style="s2">You can come in here and think about ideas,<br />you know for like hours at a time, and you</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.840" end="01:34:09.040" style="s2">don’t get eaten by a crocodile.</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.040" end="01:34:13.480" style="s2">It’s really… and you know no one comes<br />running through here pillaging, which is of</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.480" end="01:34:18.490" style="s2">course… the crocodile eating and the pillaging<br />were very, very common occurrences in our</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.490" end="01:34:20.670" style="s2">evolutionary history.</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.670" end="01:34:25.050" style="s2">For lots of our ancestors going down to get<br />water from the local river was a life or death</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.050" end="01:34:26.050" style="s2">mission.</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.050" end="01:34:31.280" style="s2">I mean I can’t imagine having to get water<br />from a crocodile infested stream.</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.280" end="01:34:35.829" style="s2">Especially when that’s where the lions are<br />hanging out too, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.829" end="01:34:37.610" style="s2">So, that’s order.</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.610" end="01:34:39.389" style="s2">That’s the positive element of order.</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.389" end="01:34:43.500" style="s2">Now you can say, students say this a lot:<br />“oh my God, I’m so constrained within</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.500" end="01:34:47.110" style="s2">these boxes, it’s destroying my individuality”<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.110" end="01:34:48.190" style="s2">And that’s the tyrannical…</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.190" end="01:34:54.989" style="s2">I mean it’s pathetic in some sense, because<br />God, you’re so privileged it’s beyond</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.989" end="01:34:56.090" style="s2">comprehension.</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.090" end="01:35:02.469" style="s2">But having said that, it is also the case,<br />and the case has to be made, that you do have</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.469" end="01:35:06.690" style="s2">to sacrifice your potential to cultural norms.</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.690" end="01:35:10.610" style="s2">And that is… you can argue that that’s<br />destructive.</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.610" end="01:35:12.099" style="s2">And sometimes it is destructive.</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.099" end="01:35:15.100" style="s2">Like creative people don’t fit very well<br />into nested boxes.</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.100" end="01:35:19.469" style="s2">And in order for them to fit they have to<br />do damage in some sense to their psyches,</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.469" end="01:35:28.219" style="s2">because they’re not naturally made to…<br />that isn’t their natural environment, boxes</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.219" end="01:35:29.580" style="s2">within boxes.</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.580" end="01:35:31.320" style="s2">And so they might say, well I’m being oppressed.</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.320" end="01:35:34.080" style="s2">It’s like, well of course you’re being<br />oppressed.</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.080" end="01:35:38.619" style="s2">If you’re in fifty boxes that’s constrain<br />your freedom of movement, but maybe you should</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.619" end="01:35:41.790" style="s2">be somewhat grateful for the fact that the<br />boxes exist.</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.790" end="01:35:43.630" style="s2">You think, well you don’t even notice them.</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.630" end="01:35:47.420" style="s2">The boxes are so effective that you don’t<br />even notice them.</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.420" end="01:35:52.290" style="s2">You can even criticise them, and you should,<br />you know, maybe they could be better and not</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.290" end="01:35:54.429" style="s2">quite as rigid, and so forth.</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.429" end="01:36:03.780" style="s2">And the criticism is justified but you have<br />to keep both of the representations in mind</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.780" end="01:36:05.600" style="s2">at the same time, you know.</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.600" end="01:36:08.599" style="s2">Your culture is the wise king and the despot<br />at the same time.</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.599" end="01:36:16.390" style="s2">And people hate that sort of thing because…<br />and you know our rational minds and our history</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.390" end="01:36:22.179" style="s2">of logical intellectual thinking has forced<br />us to assume that a thing can’t be itself</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.179" end="01:36:24.619" style="s2">and its opposite at the same time.</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.619" end="01:36:30.309" style="s2">But unfortunately when you’re talking about<br />very large-scale categories, things are what</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.309" end="01:36:32.800" style="s2">they are and their opposite at the same time.</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.800" end="01:36:38.449" style="s2">Because culture is the wise king and the tyrant,<br />and that means it’s very difficult to adjust</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.449" end="01:36:42.150" style="s2">your behaviour in relationship to it, because<br />you never know if you’re talking to the</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.150" end="01:36:43.320" style="s2">wise king or the tyrant.</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.320" end="01:36:45.930" style="s2">You know, and you feel that.</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.930" end="01:36:49.260" style="s2">If you have to do your taxes or if you have<br />to deal with the university bureaucracy in</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.260" end="01:36:53.829" style="s2">some way, it’s like, you’re a number,<br />you know, and you’re just annoying, like</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.829" end="01:36:57.500" style="s2">patients in the hospital, because hospitals<br />would run a lot better if they didn’t have</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.500" end="01:36:58.949" style="s2">any patients in them, obviously.</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.949" end="01:37:02.600" style="s2">And you know, you feel that, of course, whenever<br />you’re in a very complex bureaucracy.</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.600" end="01:37:06.400" style="s2">It’s like, you’re exchangeable, and that’s<br />very annoying.</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.400" end="01:37:08.660" style="s2">But by the same token, here you are.</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.660" end="01:37:13.599" style="s2">So you have to criticise… this is also a<br />very complex form of moral behaviour.</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.599" end="01:37:16.929" style="s2">You have to criticise with gratitude.</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.929" end="01:37:22.230" style="s2">And that’s something that students should<br />really be taught in university, because the</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.230" end="01:37:27.449" style="s2">opposite of gratitude is resentment, and there<br />is nothing that’s more pathological than</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.449" end="01:37:28.449" style="s2">resentment.</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.449" end="01:37:33.870" style="s2">The only thing that comes close to resentment,<br />in terms of its capacity to produce misery,</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.870" end="01:37:38.940" style="s2">is arrogance, and those things are often…<br />arrogance, resentment, and deceit… it’s</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.940" end="01:37:40.170" style="s2">like that’s the evil triad.</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.170" end="01:37:44.300" style="s2">You get all those three things going in your<br />life and boy, you’re going to be in rough</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.300" end="01:37:47.520" style="s2">shape very, very rapidly.</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.520" end="01:37:53.719" style="s2">So then, let’s take a break, for fifteen<br />minutes, okay?</p>
