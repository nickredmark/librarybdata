<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">and over the course of uh a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.799" end="00:04:08.879" style="s2">years there</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">i built the slashdot thing cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.879" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">and uh as i recall the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">software that you ran on has always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">open source is that was that correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s always been open</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">source but it was definitely open</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:21.680" style="s2">sourced after</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">after a time the first couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.680" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">versions of it were not anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">shippable</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">okay they were you know hodgepodged</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">uh but uh after a few years we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">made a concerted effort to release the</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:48.320" style="s2">to get bigger than it did and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">foolishly</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.320" end="00:05:52.000" style="s2">uh took a fork of the reddit uh source</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.000" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">oh you and it and had the same issue it</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">had you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">massive back end scaling potential which</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:01.199" style="s2">we thought we were going to need</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">well guess what we missed that by two</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.199" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">orders of magnitude oh well</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">and so it was a disproportionate pain in</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">the ass</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">from a devops perspective and from an</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:13.280" style="s2">operational perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">uh but it was fun nonetheless and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.280" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">actually still have that code i know</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s no longer available</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">but so if anybody ever needs a copy of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">the reddit source code from 2013</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:25.600" style="s2">including a bunch of cool enhancements</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">let me know</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.600" end="00:06:30.319" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll keep that in mind should i</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">ever find a desire to build up another</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.319" end="00:06:35.759" style="s2">site the code is not bad</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">but i would also say it is not good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.759" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">somewhere in between if you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:41.440" style="s2">right i have a feeling that uh it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">developed uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.440" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">under not dissimilar circumstances from</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">my own</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">so uh that that&#39;s not really the ideal</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">way to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.160" style="s2">start an open source project and as far</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">as i know they never rewrote it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:57.199" style="s2">you can just see the uh you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">kind of like the ruins of troy 13 layers</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.199" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">of slag one on top of the other</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:02.400" style="s2">so you started around 1997 when did you</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">start to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.400" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">you know significant traffic uh we</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">i guess i don&#39;t know how you define</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">significant we were we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">pretty big pretty fast uh but i guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">that&#39;s all relative</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:18.319" style="s2">uh i was very active in the irc</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:21.280" style="s2">community uh for the linux</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.319" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">uh space i was a open source developer i</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.280" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">writing code and contributing to various</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">platforms and my site</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">even before slashdot existed had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">certain percent a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">traffic</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">but you know uh that would be like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">know hundreds or thousands of users a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">day so slashdot itself when it came out</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">when it started was just</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">me saying all of my stuff is here now uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">and it had thousands of people almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">immediately uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">but uh it grew to tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.160" style="s2">uh in a few months uh and hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:54.479" style="s2">thousands</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.160" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">uh within within a year or two um</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.479" end="00:07:59.759" style="s2">we were uh very fortunate uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">i can&#39;t i don&#39;t have a lot of advice in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.759" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">terms of how you would grow such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">except for to do the right thing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">don&#39;t be dumb uh it seems like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">lesson that a lot of websites don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">really understand anymore but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s also be honest be the right</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">place at the right time right</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:20.000" style="s2">any second man yeah exactly right and uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">as i said in the opener uh it was kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.000" end="00:08:24.960" style="s2">of the must-read source for</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">serious biz tech nerds uh in the day</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.960" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">right uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">whenever there was some hack or some new</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">policy issue that it was arising</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">first place i went slashdot for uh for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">good five years there</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">uh we were i wouldn&#39;t say the only game</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">in town but we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">heading shoulders above the rest because</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">your other choices would be the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">mainstream tech publications and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:46.720" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:49.360" style="s2">they very much uh grew out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.720" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">traditional print media so they had</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.360" end="00:08:53.920" style="s2">they had a certain flavor to them uh i</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t call them stale lame and boring</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.920" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">but uh i just did</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">uh other people might right i mean yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">it was interesting and but then on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">other hand</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.320" style="s2">eventually it started to fade i still</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">sort of recall</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.320" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">when i first noticed it fading it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">you know by this point i&#39;d retired from</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">business in 2001 and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">had reinvented myself as a scientist and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">i was out at the santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">uh research on agent-based evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">artificial intelligence how about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">for a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">but i still had some you know tech</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.480" style="s2">investments and still advised if i was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">on a few boards and what have you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.480" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">remember something came up and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">immediately went to slashdot and said</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">slashdot should be the place to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">about this but about 2003</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">and there was hardly anything there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">what was there was a little weak</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">and then i discovered ours technica and</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.160" style="s2">that then became my kind of go-to place</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">around that time</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.160" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">yeah ours was ours was solid for a long</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">time there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">i would say slashdot held on uh its</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">relevance uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">up until uh the era of dig</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">and reddit uh uh once they started</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">achieving a certain amount of traction</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">slashdot lost uh some of its luster</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:10.320" style="s2">uh but there was a lot going on uh and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">the new uh more</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.320" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">uh i guess the more modern crowd-sourced</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">uh flavors became more popular uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">and along with that i think uh slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">began to gently set</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">into the sun well yes that happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">anyway let&#39;s get to the point uh that uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">you know peter wang and i were talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">at least back in the day as i recall and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">who knows maybe i&#39;m getting senile but i</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:37.120" style="s2">recall that you had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.399" style="s2">rating system where people were selected</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.120" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.399" end="00:10:42.959" style="s2">uh at in relatively low frequency to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">rate the stories</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.959" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">uh was that is that correct did i</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:48.959" style="s2">remember that right well</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">uh i might nitpick uh on your</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.959" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">terminology</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">uh slashdot was always a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">the story selection process when you say</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">stories uh i think about the story</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:10:59.920" style="s2">selection process</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">and i think you&#39;re trying to describe</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.920" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">the comment moderation process uh we</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">always took story submissions from</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">uh our users right in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">later eras uh in the later era the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">2007 range let&#39;s say there was a voting</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">system where the community could</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">participate in the story selection</p>

<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">think that&#39;s probably the piece that uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">that most people think of when they</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">think about uh slashdot its role</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">uh in large scale discussion systems i</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">mean there weren&#39;t a lot of systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">in 1998 1999 that would</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:45.920" style="s2">potentially have hundreds of active</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">contributors uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.920" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">posting uh within a few hours uh and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">also allowed</p>

<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">so our system uh was uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">uniquely evolved to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">saw yeah okay i think you&#39;re right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">now you know again this was a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">and i&#39;m getting old god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">uh and so was the it was the uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:12.079" style="s2">the comment moderation that you picked</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.839" style="s2">it was not everybody got the vote people</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:17.519" style="s2">were picked for short periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.839" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">like a couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.519" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">and and you had i don&#39;t know did you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:21.760" style="s2">have a limited number of votes i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">even remember but</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.760" end="00:12:25.279" style="s2">i still remember being selected several</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">times and taking it</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.279" end="00:12:28.720" style="s2">seriously because it was a high-powered</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.600" style="s2">signal you know unlike</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.720" end="00:12:33.200" style="s2">a like on facebook or an update right on</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.600" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">reddit what you think of as a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.200" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">if you got tapped uh with this limited</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">uh period uh franchise yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">took it seriously</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">why don&#39;t you explain how that system</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">worked yeah scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">uh creates value uh the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:53.519" style="s2">system generally worked is that uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:56.240" style="s2">you had to be an active participant</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.519" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">within the community uh which i had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.240" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">number of different</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">metrics that i would measure to decide</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">if you were able to participate or not</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">one of the things was you got to read</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:09.600" style="s2">the site and you can&#39;t read too much</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.200" style="s2">so there was sort of a sweet spot you</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.600" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">had to read the page the site more than</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.200" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">a couple of times a day and you had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">read the site less than let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll pick a number 50 times a day if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">were that then we then the concern would</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.720" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">be that you were trying to game the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">system and get points</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">uh intentionally and we absolutely had</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">to deal with that problem later on</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">but the system would basically dole out</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:34.560" style="s2">eligibility tokens</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">if you happened to be if you fell within</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">the the window of people who were good</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">contributors during that time window and</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">when the system so basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.959" style="s2">as users would post comments we would</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">push eligibility tokens into the system</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.959" end="00:13:51.199" style="s2">and once uh enough comments had been in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">the system we would pull whoever had the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.199" end="00:13:54.639" style="s2">most tokens</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">uh out of the pile uh and give them mod</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.639" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">points so that would actually amount to</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.880" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">uh you know a few hundred people a day</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">uh or maybe a few thousand people a day</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">depending on the era getting mod points</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">uh at which point uh the specifics would</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:08.240" style="s2">vary</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:10.480" style="s2">depending on whether you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.240" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">about 1998 or 2008 but</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.480" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">you&#39;d get let&#39;s say five or ten points</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">and you were usually given 24</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">48 72 hours to spend them uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">at which point you would read the</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">comments and you would find the ones you</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">liked and you could choose to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">send them up a point or down a point and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.120" style="s2">i mean at the core that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">system i</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.120" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">we had uh scarcity uh which</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">created urgency uh and over time</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">we were able to identify</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">uh users who were bad actors and users</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">who were good actors</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">within the system and sort of uh adjust</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">some levers</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">to make sure that the right people were</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">getting the points at the right time and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:52.880" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.880" style="s2">the bad actors got weeded out of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.880" end="00:14:56.800" style="s2">system and we were able to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.880" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">place where we were able to spend</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.800" end="00:15:00.079" style="s2">we were able to generate a community</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">that could spend you know thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.079" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2">points within the system a day</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">which was usually enough i i tried to</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">maintain a ratio of comment posts to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">moderator activity</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">uh and that that that kind of was the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">sweet spot whereas</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">today when you see a you know a tweet or</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">a</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:22.000" style="s2">uh that&#39;s essentially an infinite</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.760" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">resource you can have a tweet with uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.000" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">with 10 million likes on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">but the system the slashdot system was</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">designed uh to not actually have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">uh because i always felt that uh the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">scarcity is what uh what made the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">kind of reliable yeah exactly i mean at</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">the time when i was most active on</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">did it and i paid a lot of attention to</p>

<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">and so i think that was uh you know damn</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:04.240" style="s2">uh the other thing that&#39;s nice about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.800" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">is it defeats some of the game</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.240" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">theoretical hacks</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">on open rating systems i mean uh</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">upgrade them or down rate them etc</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:29.680" style="s2">your system seemed pretty damn resilient</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">said this earlier but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">uh in the later naughties we developed a</p>

<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">saw a lot of that brigading style</p>

<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:04.400" style="s2">on this uh this new system which didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.079" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">have the same scarcity of moderation</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.400" end="00:17:10.079" style="s2">but i had designed that system</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:11.919" style="s2">to avoid it rather than revealing for</p>

<p begin="00:17:11.919" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">uh integer values for</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:22.079" style="s2">the posts uh i color coded them uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:22.480" style="s2">so uh the color codes underneath the</p>

<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">could represent uh any number they it</p>

<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">uh if it was the right seven uh but uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.840" end="00:17:33.600" style="s2">or the right like if i moderated it up</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">that was worth more than you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.600" end="00:17:38.000" style="s2">because sorry jim you&#39;re a nice guy but</p>

<p begin="00:17:39.600" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">uh but uh the the system we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">absolutely had that brigading type</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.480" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:51.120" style="s2">behavior in that system and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.480" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">the development of that of the the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.120" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">rating system</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">very much was influenced by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:57.360" style="s2">successes that we had had with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">moderation system i was trying to find</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.360" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">a hybrid uh between the two between the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">more public</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">uh reddit type systems uh which are</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">easily gameable</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">or relatively easily gameable uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">what i found actually is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">some of the worst offenders for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.919" style="s2">brigading style tactics were actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">the publishers themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.919" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">they would routinely</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">get into our system we called it the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">fire hose they would get into the fire</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">hose and they would</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">uh moderate themselves up and they would</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:31.120" style="s2">send their rivals down like the worst</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">would be like an embargoed news tech</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.120" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">release</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">uh where you know you got five p you got</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">your rs technicas and you got your pc</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">magazines and they&#39;ve all got the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">embargo news story coming out at 1201</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.000" style="s2">and they would all log in and moderate</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:46.400" style="s2">their own story up and their</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.000" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">rival publications down and that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.400" end="00:18:49.679" style="s2">just be like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">you know a dozen people uh but it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.679" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">i think at that that was kind of the era</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:55.200" style="s2">where i realized oh great the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">publications are just as crappy as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.200" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">randos</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">uh and uh it took me a little while to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">realize that the governments would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.039" style="s2">doing the exact same thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:05.840" style="s2">where we see our</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.039" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">the the twitters in the the mid-2015s or</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.840" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">the facebooks</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">uh where now you have government actors</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:13.440" style="s2">what uh what uh might have been being</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">done by a nand</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.440" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">tech or something in 2007. yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">and again this is what you should expect</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">game theory right</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">uh you give you give uh agents an</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">ecosystem and they will attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2"> manipulate it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:29.520" style="s2">you know i&#39;ll confess to in the early</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">days when i was i wouldn&#39;t call it the</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">we spent we spent years developing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">defensive techniques against those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:00.160" style="s2">uh those sorts of behaviors uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">actually felt a little bad for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.160" end="00:20:04.559" style="s2">reddits and the digs because</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">uh when they started gaining traction uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.559" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">and popularity</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">those sorts of behaviors just became</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">immediately obvious and</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.200" end="00:20:13.360" style="s2">the the users of those systems the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">comment posters</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.360" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">had uh developed these techniques on</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">slashdot and we had spent years</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:21.760" style="s2">hardening</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">ourselves against them uh so when uh the</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:47.360" style="s2">although i would i would actually argue</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">that now</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.360" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">it seems like the people who are working</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">the psychology and more about just</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">trying to make your point heard</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">uh and now it&#39;s a lot more savvy a lot</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">its core we really worked hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.000" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">during my tenure to maintain the ability</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">to post anonymity here to post</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">anonymously</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:25.600" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s not something i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">exists anymore and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.600" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">i mean whether or not that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:33.360" style="s2">value is a different discussion</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">uh but uh we valued it at the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.360" end="00:22:38.960" style="s2">and that made it very difficult uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:41.360" style="s2">for uh for us to have a lot of defenses</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.960" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">against folks because like you say tor</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.360" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">i mean even before tor um unsecured</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">relay servers that was our that was our</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">first problem on uh unsecured proxy</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">servers</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">uh and then that would evolve into tor</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">and then we had people</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:56.799" style="s2">who would uh they would bought the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:59.440" style="s2">creation of user accounts</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.799" end="00:22:59.840" style="s2">uh and uh so that they could get around</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.440" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">we would throttle anonymous users in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">you know maybe a little bit more rigidly</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">than regular users because i couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:11.919" style="s2">tell if you were one user or 50</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">without enough data uh so we would i</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.919" end="00:23:16.159" style="s2">don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">it was it was a difficult time uh and uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.159" end="00:23:19.919" style="s2">it gave me a good sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">folks that are at the major platforms</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.919" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">are dealing with today</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s a bummer because they got</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">uh and i think that now that everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:31.280" style="s2">aware that that&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit too late the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">cat&#39;s kinda out of the bag for those</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:35.440" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">yeah sort of but you know nothing says</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.440" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t change their moderations</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:43.520" style="s2">uh policy well go ahead moderate</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">policies uh but uh it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.520" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">it&#39;s about uh user expectation uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">and i think that uh you but users of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">these systems</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">uh like here&#39;s a dumb example</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">uh the fact that the the like count on</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">twitter is displayed as a numeric</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">integer creates a whole number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">perverse incentives for bad actors and</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">for good actors</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">but it but they can&#39;t take that number</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">away in 2020 people would freak</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:11.919" style="s2">uh but you know that number is probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:13.200" style="s2">damaging to them if they simply replaced</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">that with percentiles</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.200" end="00:24:16.400" style="s2">and said this comments in the 99th</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">percentile for today</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.400" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">uh a lot of edge case behavior would go</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">uh but it also at the lower levels would</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:27.279" style="s2">take away uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">incentive because uh moving to uh you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.279" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">know the from the zero to the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:31.679" style="s2">percentile is actually a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">burden for</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.679" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">for most online content yep though</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:38.159" style="s2">actually jack has mused about getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">rid of the count right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.159" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">talked about it and at one point said he</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">was going to he didn&#39;t actually but</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:46.799" style="s2">uh yeah they&#39;re at least thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">it right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.799" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">all the time uh i think that uh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">all doing their best in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">questionable situation but</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.000" style="s2">these decisions are hard and they have</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">influence uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.000" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">at the at the street level where you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">just have like a random three people</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">tweeting back and forth at each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">but also at the the state actor level</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:09.919" style="s2">uh these are hard hard problems and if</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">you haven&#39;t been deep in it uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.919" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand the complexities of</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">them and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">i wish them all the best uh i wish they</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">would have i wish they would have hired</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">me for like one day of consulting in</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">like 2008 so i could sit down with them</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">look these are what this is what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">to happen to you uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">you need to harden against this now you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">know yep and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.520" end="00:25:30.960" style="s2">again they should have just known that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">any ecosystem that has</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.960" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">targets of value that can be exploited</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:38.159" style="s2">exploited right and you discovered many</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:39.120" style="s2">of them though probably not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.159" end="00:25:40.640" style="s2">oh definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.120" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">uh we were to start we were discovering</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.640" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">new ones right until the day left</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.080" style="s2">yep uh is there anybody out there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">using the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.080" end="00:25:52.480" style="s2">uh you know high value scarce uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">moderation technique that you guys had</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.480" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">yeah no i haven&#39;t seen well nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:25:58.400" style="s2">using our specifics uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">i imagine there are systems out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.400" end="00:26:03.440" style="s2">that that use them but they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">the notions that we&#39;re playing with</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.440" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">probably have more in common with video</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">than uh like a moderation system</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">you know things like running out of ammo</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:16.960" style="s2">and stuff uh in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">in a in a game you know has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">with you know do we add more</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:22.400" style="s2">ammo and more weapons to make this map</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:25.039" style="s2">more fun or does that create this</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.400" end="00:26:26.159" style="s2">make this map be uh imbalanced towards a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.039" end="00:26:28.080" style="s2">certain play style</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.159" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">i think that uh the gaming community</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.080" end="00:26:30.159" style="s2">probably deals with these sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">more uh than the reddit communities</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:37.200" style="s2">i think that uh the the larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.200" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">they&#39;re so focused on maximizing time on</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">site</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">uh that the notion that you would</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:47.360" style="s2">throttle uh in interactive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">uh is is a difficult one because when</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.360" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">you i mean what what are you doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:51.919" style="s2">except</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">uh designing metrics and measuring</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.919" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.799" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">with your various metrics uh and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:00.080" style="s2">what tells you that uh that a user is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:01.919" style="s2">enjoying your system more</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.080" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">than them clicking a like button that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.919" end="00:27:05.919" style="s2">a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">uh and so they they they have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.919" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">different incentive</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">uh it&#39;s i don&#39;t know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">hard problem uh i&#39;ve never seen anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:16.240" style="s2">uh deploy things like at that to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">extreme scale that we did</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.240" end="00:27:19.919" style="s2">there are plenty of systems that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">restrict moderator access</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">but they generally do so to tiers or</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:27.440" style="s2">classes of users</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">and not to uh i mean the slashdot system</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.440" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">was very much designed to give</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:33.919" style="s2">everybody a shot uh like i i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.039" style="s2">test you out welcome to the system</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.919" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve been around for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.039" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">months</p>

<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">and if you prove yourself worthy</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna get to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:44.480" style="s2">the system uh every couple of weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re not gonna have</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">yeah great it was a great idea it really</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">was i and that&#39;s what that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:51.360" style="s2">the conversation peter and i were having</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.360" end="00:27:54.880" style="s2">hmm this was an actually interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">different and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.880" end="00:27:59.120" style="s2">seemingly effective uh way to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">moderation and we at least had never</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.120" end="00:28:02.480" style="s2">seen it elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">i think that uh i mean the the systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.480" end="00:28:07.840" style="s2">today they suffer with uh with</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">another uh a number of uh interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.840" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">hamstrings on this regard as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">uh one of slashdot&#39;s key advantages in</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">the early days is that the community was</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">really friggin smart</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">and the topic of the site was</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">relatively narrow uh it was all</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">generally tech or sci-fi or i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:29.520" style="s2">was news for nerds it was it was that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">that vain and especially for the first</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.520" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">uh they&#39;re just we weren&#39;t talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">the general things that you would see</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">like on uh a national debate stage</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">uh we were talking about a niche uh and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">if uh you&#39;re an expert uh in</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.279" style="s2">operating systems uh then your your</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">opinion on uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.279" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">hardware and on video cards might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">reasonably accurate</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:55.039" style="s2">uh but just because you&#39;re an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">encryption doesn&#39;t make you an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.039" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">immigration policy</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">uh and i think that the the modern</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">systems suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">uh you&#39;re you&#39;re expected to be all</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">things or people tend to be are</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">to per to portray themselves as being</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">expert in all things</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">when they&#39;re online so if i&#39;m logged in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">on reddit</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">uh or twitter uh whether or not i&#39;m uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">uh participating in uh the uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">pc sales subreddit or</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">uh the donald i suppose the donald&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">around no more but uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.960" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">but but regardless the system regards me</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">as being generally equal</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">uh in each of these areas although i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">maybe more of an expert</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.120" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">in one subject than the other uh and i</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">think that that&#39;s really where we end up</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">in so much trouble with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">twitter these days is that you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">a person who&#39;s an expert they have they</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:45.760" style="s2">have a domain of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">and they gain followers because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.760" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">domain expertise and then that allows</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">outside of their expertise to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">weighed with uh an undeserved value</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.720" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">because of their expertise in another</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.840" style="s2">domain uh and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">so therefore because they were</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:10.000" style="s2">successful in attracting followers</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:12.399" style="s2">from their domain expertise area uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.000" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">their uh opinions on areas where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.399" end="00:30:16.799" style="s2">not they&#39;re simply not qualified</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.399" style="s2">gain likes uh they gain they they gain</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.799" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">unearned popularity</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.399" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">uh and i think that a slashdot uh had a</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">lot of advantage because at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:25.039" style="s2">earlier days the community was</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.039" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">focused uh on subject matter so we had</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">it we had a good advantage there as we</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">broadened out and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">added things like politics and stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">the site i think that that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">uh became more of a problem uh but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">the modern systems they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.520" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">uh on twitter you can follow me because</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.520" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in seeing me make pens</p>

<p begin="00:30:58.000" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">but my</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.360" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">qualifications on any of these things</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">has nothing to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:08.720" style="s2">my qualification for if i happen to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:10.320" style="s2">tweet that the detroit tigers won today</p>

<p begin="00:31:10.320" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">examples but people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">use them for legitimately important</p>

<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:19.919" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:21.039" style="s2">between the two yep and you talk about</p>

<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">scores the scores of comments were rated</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.039" style="s2">from negative one to five and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">the the the database entry was literally</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.039" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">just an integer</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">and it was literally just sum it all up</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">add and subtract when people</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">participated uh over time that became</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">uh not nearly com and not nearly good</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:24.320" style="s2">enough because you have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">weird cases like for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.320" end="00:33:27.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between a comment</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:29.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a score five and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.519" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">tries to moderate it up to six</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.600" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">uh and then it so flutters five six five</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">six five six five six what does that</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">uh to a user and to the moderators uh i</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:40.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t like that because</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">i was trying to balance the number of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.960" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">points being spent in the system on any</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:45.600" style="s2">given day</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">uh but there&#39;s there&#39;s that&#39;s a signal</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.600" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">there and i have to capitalize on that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">uh when we designed the achievement</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">system for slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:55.679" style="s2">uh we sort of modeled it after the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:56.559" style="s2">that world of warcraft did theirs but as</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">a joke</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">uh we made each of the tiers of um</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">of your rating of your achievement of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:07.120" style="s2">your score in the achievement system</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">uh each each was exponential it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">log five it was exponential</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:13.919" style="s2">so uh to you know get to rank eight</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.000" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">or whatever in an achievement category</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.919" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">it had to be two to the eighth</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">uh uh points uh or</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">uh events uh that measured that so</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.000" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">there were there were a number of uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">achievements in the system that uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">you know you&#39;d suddenly find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.760" style="s2">well you gotta post 16 million comments</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:33.119" style="s2">in order to get to the next tier because</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.760" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s exponential</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.119" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">yeah log two base that&#39;s basically log</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:38.639" style="s2">two right uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">and log five is even worse right right</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.639" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">and so we did we did</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">essentially a similar thing uh because i</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">didn&#39;t want people to treat that as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">gameable thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">so at some point uh the difference</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">between you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about uh like an easy</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:53.679" style="s2">like a free action like a like or</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.679" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">on reddit um you know if a user has done</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">a hundred thousand times over the course</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">of a year whether or not they do it a</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:04.880" style="s2">hundred thousand times or two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">thousand times doesn&#39;t really matter all</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.880" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">that much that you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">difference between you know that those</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">the orders of magnitude are really all</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.760" style="s2">that matters at that point</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why we we like the log</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.760" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">the logarithmic scale because it does it</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s essentially the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">of the exponential so it&#39;s exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">reason you know the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:24.880" style="s2">hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">and two hundred thousand posts is much</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.880" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">more d</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.880" style="s2">much different than between twenty posts</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">and a hundred thousand posts</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.880" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">right the the actual comment moderation</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">system on slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">uh didn&#39;t exactly use that uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:39.760" style="s2">but uh we definitely like by the end we</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.760" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">the system underneath is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">complicated when i left</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">uh and i can&#39;t imagine that it&#39;s changed</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">uh in the last eight nine years but uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:52.079" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a lot of weird math going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.079" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">underneath there</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">uh like to deal with like weird weird</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">edge cases like for example what happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">if i find a bot</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">uh in the system uh and uh i discover</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:06.800" style="s2">that that bot has been doing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">crappy in my system for two weeks and i</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.800" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t notice well</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:11.520" style="s2">i the system that we had actually had</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.520" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">extract that user from the system i</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">could erase their scores and that might</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">mean like a lot of weird stuff like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">example i was talking about earlier you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.200" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">got a score five comment that gets</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">moderated up to six but slash that</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.560" end="00:36:25.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have score six</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s just four five four five four</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.440" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">five six five four five bouncing around</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">in that range</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:31.440" style="s2">well what happens when you pull somebody</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">out uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.440" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">pull somebody&#39;s influence out of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:37.680" style="s2">like i&#39;m like a week later well that</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">comment isn&#39;t getting active moderation</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.680" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">uh so you actually have to replay uh the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:44.320" style="s2">moderation history</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">uh that occurred to that individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.320" end="00:36:48.720" style="s2">comment and see that this guy</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:51.359" style="s2">who uh you know you might have weighted</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.720" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">him as a 100 contributing user</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.359" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">uh a week ago but now you realize he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">zero percent control you gotta you gotta</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">make sure that uh you keep the score</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">fair uh to the to the user who</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">uh posted the comment it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:07.839" style="s2">uh and i don&#39;t think people really think</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">through the complexities of this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.839" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">unless they are neck deep in it for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.280" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">yeah and of course uh be even harder to</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">implement something like that on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:17.280" style="s2">scale of uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">twitter or facebook where instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.280" end="00:37:20.079" style="s2">know hundreds of thousands or a few</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">millions</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.079" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">of users you&#39;re talking about billions</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">right for sure and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">they have the the further problem where</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:28.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.720" style="s2">uh like like i was saying earlier you</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.720" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">know your post in one domain of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.720" end="00:37:34.240" style="s2">expertise</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">uh you could get retweeted tomorrow by</p>

<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">uh gets thrown out the window it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a complicated problem</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">parse that data and see what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">going on have you ever reached out to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">them to uh you know offer your expertise</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">what happened this what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.359" end="00:38:45.520" style="s2">slash dot</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">uh why did hacker news kick your ass</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.520" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">uh hacker news never kicked our ass</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">hacker news is a different deal entirely</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">um well i think slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">became victim of his own success uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:02.640" style="s2">we uh that when the site began</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">it was a very dedicated population of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.640" end="00:39:05.359" style="s2">contributors uh who were generally</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">expert</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.359" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">uh in the the areas of the nerd culture</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">that we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">that we were covering and uh over the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.560" end="00:39:16.480" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:19.920" style="s2">uh other choices came along and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.480" end="00:39:21.520" style="s2">uh when a population starts off with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:23.119" style="s2">core of experts</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.520" end="00:39:25.040" style="s2">the inevitable thing that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.119" end="00:39:28.240" style="s2">that a secondary population of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.040" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">of hangers on uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.240" end="00:39:31.440" style="s2">moves into the into the system as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.440" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">uh i think that uh over the course of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.359" style="s2">few years</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">uh a lot of the expert folks got pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.359" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">annoyed by the noobs</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">uh and other possibilities came out too</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:45.920" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:48.000" style="s2">what happens like reddit and twitter uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.920" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">and i guess before before those to a</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.000" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">certain extent dig</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.760" style="s2">uh they they created a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">incentive for users because the story</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.760" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">selection process</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">that those platforms used was</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">driven entirely or mostly entirely by</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:06.480" style="s2">the users themselves which meant that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:09.599" style="s2">those systems can be faster</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.480" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">a tweet that i make right now goes out</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.599" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">to all of my followers within a second</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">uh and they are limited only by how fast</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">they can refresh or how often they</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">refresh twitter on any given day</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:21.680" style="s2">slash dot had itself limited to you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.680" end="00:40:25.119" style="s2">a dozen articles a day a dozen stories a</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">day so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.119" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">if you want more than 12 stories a day</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">or if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">are more interested and you want to deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">dive into a specific area well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">not going to work too well for you on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">so the the the reddits and the twitters</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">allowed the power user to get more of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">what they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">and it allowed them to get it faster</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">and once the power users started</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">figuring that out well the power users</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.000" style="s2">started losing interest</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">uh in slashdot because at that point</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.000" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">they have to jump through the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">editorial hoop created by the slashdot</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">editorial process itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:03.119" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s legit and fair and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">i i would do the same in their shoes</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.119" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">most likely</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">uh but uh i think that uh you play that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">forward for a few years and you lose</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">five ten fifteen twenty percent of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">original audience uh for that reason and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:17.520" style="s2">then what you have left is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">is a bit of a hollow shell compared to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.520" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">what you had before</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t so much uh a collapse as</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">much as it was a slow sad death by</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">attrition</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">um and uh i i don&#39;t think that hacker</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:30.880" style="s2">news</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.000" style="s2">kicked our butt uh i would actually say</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.880" end="00:41:35.040" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.000" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">dig knocked us off our pedestal uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.040" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">reddit did it did it mostly right uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">twitter&#39;s a different beast</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">uh i mean twitter and reddit and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.040" style="s2">facebook are i guess the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">platforms now and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.040" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">they each succeed and fail along a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">vector but they each have very clear</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">advantages</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">out of uh over slash dot even without</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">the the scale advantages that you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">uh because the other thing to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">mind is that with slashdot i</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">very very consciously worked my butt off</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">keep it uh within a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">sphere of of domain expertise i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">want slashdot covering stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">outside of the news for nurse nerds</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">and if you want something that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">news in under the news for nerds</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">umbrella you gotta go somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:31.599" style="s2">and i think that uh that was slashdot&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">advantage but that had the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.599" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">negative side effect that</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s going to be reading</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">slashdot in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">was probably reading slashdot in 1990 98</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">and the thing about people is that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">can&#39;t make more people that were reading</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">slashdot in 1998 that&#39;s a fixed pool</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">that can only shrink</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">uh so the only way that you can grow</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">your population is to broaden</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">uh your domain of expertise uh or lower</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.119" style="s2">your standards</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">and i wasn&#39;t really comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.119" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">either of those options</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening over</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">there today but i imagine probably more</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">of the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:10.880" style="s2">interesting well rob thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:13.520" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.880" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">a walk through the history of one of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">uh web sites of that era</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">uh i was particularly enjoyed uh jumping</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">into more of the details on how your</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">comment moderation system worked and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">i hope some listeners out there who work</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">at some of these platform companies or</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:34.000" style="s2">might say hey maybe they ought to talk</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">some of this thinking i suspect would</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.680" style="s2">help these platform companies do a</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.680" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t mean to brag but i pretty</p>
