<p begin="00:00:05.130" end="00:00:11.370" style="s2">save humanity it also might be what</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:12.570" style="s2">tears us apart I asked a question on</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.370" end="00:00:14.040" style="s2">Twitter this morning because it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.570" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">question I was asking in my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.040" end="00:00:18.750" style="s2">laying in bed waking up if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:21.270" style="s2">choose between two worlds</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.750" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">one of which was everybody looks the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.270" end="00:00:27.180" style="s2">same everyone has the same exterior but</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">in our internal selves are very diverse</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.180" end="00:00:32.369" style="s2">and we know that or we all look</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:35.340" style="s2">completely different but we have the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.369" end="00:00:37.320" style="s2">same internal structure we have the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.340" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">emotions the same intelligence the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.320" end="00:00:44.190" style="s2">capacity and capability and inside right</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:48.420" style="s2">do we have diverse exteriors or diverse</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.190" end="00:00:52.949" style="s2">interiors it&#39;s obvious we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.420" end="00:00:56.699" style="s2">world of both but often I think we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.949" end="00:00:59.190" style="s2">so wrapped up in that we have both of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.699" end="00:01:02.910" style="s2">them that we forget or we don&#39;t honor</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:07.320" style="s2">both of them so in a world that is we</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.910" end="00:01:08.729" style="s2">all look the same then looks our next is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.320" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">your important same assure maybe we wear</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.729" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">different clothes but your hairstyle you</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:14.760" style="s2">can&#39;t really be angry someone&#39;s no size</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:16.110" style="s2">or someone has too big of teeth because</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.760" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">you&#39;re all the same unless you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.110" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">have augmentation done but your internal</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">structure you&#39;re gonna see okay we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">different capacity for emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">response we&#39;ve different capacity people</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">to tackle complex problems or to be able</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">to do the physical intelligence things</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">like playing sports in a world where the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">opposite is true where we&#39;re all exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">the same inside but we look different on</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:46.229" style="s2">the outside then we&#39;re going to have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">same capacity for emotion we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.229" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">think the same thoughts have the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.520" end="00:01:50.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna experience the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">slightly differently because of how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.280" end="00:01:53.579" style="s2">world treats us if that world treats</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:56.930" style="s2">people differently because their looks I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.579" end="00:02:00.299" style="s2">think we trinsic lee and logically know</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.930" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">that most of what somebody looks like is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.299" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">beyond their control without drastic</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">surgery and so whether your face is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">symmetrical whether what color your hair</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.140" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t color your eyes are</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">are all potentially things you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.580" style="s2">change but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a different analysis and ERDs of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">beauty that really nobody can obtain but</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">they&#39;re all we&#39;re all measured up</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">against them and which is ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2">it&#39;s something we have to do away with</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:35.069" style="s2">we have to start honoring that all beat</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.760" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">bodies are amazing all bodies are</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.069" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">beautiful they don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">beautiful to everyone you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:42.660" style="s2">be attracted to me I don&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:45.269" style="s2">attracted to you but that we allow for</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.660" end="00:02:47.310" style="s2">the diversity of the external all of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.269" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">sizes all of our shapes all of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.310" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">colors all of our things we choose to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">wear or not wear our diverse and yet so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:57.420" style="s2">much of our life depends on what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.299" style="s2">look like and how you present in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.420" end="00:03:03.599" style="s2">world that we almost forget that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.299" end="00:03:05.750" style="s2">interior world is also diverse that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.599" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">have different capabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.750" end="00:03:10.049" style="s2">experiencing emotions we can see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">we&#39;re tall and short we can see that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.049" end="00:03:15.660" style="s2">we&#39;re bigger and smaller we cannot see</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:17.549" style="s2">that we&#39;re just looking at someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.660" end="00:03:20.040" style="s2">whether they&#39;re quicker to anger whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.549" end="00:03:21.810" style="s2">they&#39;ve experienced more grief whether</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.040" end="00:03:23.750" style="s2">they what kind of intelligence they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.810" end="00:03:28.920" style="s2">a college kind of challenges they have</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">we already hurt people based on what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.920" end="00:03:33.000" style="s2">they look like or don&#39;t look like even</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:36.930" style="s2">the most gorgeous people the society</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.000" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">says is are the ideal beauty are still</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.930" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">hurt by the fact that our world is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:47.790" style="s2">wrapped up in looks I think and yet we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:50.519" style="s2">get that it&#39;s not important and yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.790" end="00:03:53.670" style="s2">highly important our internal world we</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.519" end="00:03:55.560" style="s2">treat as like you have more power here</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.670" end="00:03:56.819" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think you do just like you</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.560" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">can&#39;t change the shape of your nose</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.819" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">about without surgery without drastic</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">work you can&#39;t necessarily change your</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:08.430" style="s2">emotional states like the the frequency</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">of having them or the what you do in</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.430" end="00:04:11.730" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">it&#39;ll it&#39;s hard in that moment and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.730" end="00:04:15.660" style="s2">just this thought this question got me</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.609" end="00:04:17.099" style="s2">to thinking about this today and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:19.049" style="s2">thought maybe someone else might also</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.099" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">want to think about it what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.049" end="00:04:23.640" style="s2">world if you had to choose because</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:25.070" style="s2">someone you know you are chose neither</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.640" end="00:04:27.860" style="s2">option on</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.070" end="00:04:30.440" style="s2">which it&#39;s clearly a hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.860" end="00:04:31.880" style="s2">question you can&#39;t choose neither it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.440" end="00:04:34.670" style="s2">like a skewed you wanna get ripped apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.880" end="00:04:36.800" style="s2">by a tiger or a shark clearly the answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.670" end="00:04:39.970" style="s2">is neither clearly the answer to this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.800" end="00:04:42.710" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to live in a world of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.970" end="00:04:45.290" style="s2">uniformity and looks or in personality</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.710" end="00:04:47.480" style="s2">but I want to celebrate the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.290" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">that we are all of our diversity because</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.480" end="00:04:50.840" style="s2">it&#39;s already here we might as well</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">utilize it to create a world that works</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.840" end="00:04:57.170" style="s2">for us to create a world that allows</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:59.450" style="s2">that diversity to feed into the common</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.170" end="00:05:01.340" style="s2">good and we all benefit rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.450" end="00:05:02.750" style="s2">picking out who should be successful and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.340" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">allowing them to thrive and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.750" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">else is look so that&#39;s today&#39;s video</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:11.510" style="s2">will again some time a better world&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:15.040" style="s2">its way and we&#39;re all going to</p>
