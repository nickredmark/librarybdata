<p begin="00:00:01.619" end="00:00:05.430" style="s2">all right so this will be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.659" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">break up from that from the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:09.120" style="s2">but it is something I want to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:11.160" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s that valuable that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.120" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">I want people to hear it and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.160" end="00:00:15.959" style="s2">distinction you make between the having</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">mode and having needs and the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.959" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">and being needs for yeah this is one</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">where look I have a guy that comes along</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:25.339" style="s2">to the meetup and watches this with me</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:28.669" style="s2">very very smart guy very well educated</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.339" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">he works in some sort of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.669" end="00:00:33.750" style="s2">capacity with people who have various</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:35.490" style="s2">problems and he takes transformation</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.750" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">seriously from every level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.490" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">physiological psychological spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">but even this distinction for him I</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.860" style="s2">think was like a light bulb moment in</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">terms of well it&#39;s such a simple way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.860" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">articulate something so fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">about what we are that speaks</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:52.770" style="s2">importantly to where we are often going</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.870" style="s2">wrong in current culture so if you would</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.770" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">please the having mode and the being</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.870" end="00:00:57.530" style="s2">mode I&#39;d love for you to tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.530" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">thank you so the idea is drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:10.109" style="s2">Erich Fromm his book you know to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">to be but and and Fromm is clear about</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.109" end="00:01:12.899" style="s2">this he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:15.299" style="s2">originator of this distinction you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.899" end="00:01:16.020" style="s2">find analogous distinctions in in many</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.299" end="00:01:17.759" style="s2">places</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">Steven Bachelor has a version of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:21.899" style="s2">distinction in his book alone with</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">others an existential interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.899" end="00:01:27.569" style="s2">Buddhism you can find something an</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">allegation Gabriel Marcel so right and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.569" end="00:01:31.229" style="s2">think even you could understand parts of</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:33.359" style="s2">what Heidegger is doing using this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.229" end="00:01:34.920" style="s2">distinction but I think Fromm and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.359" end="00:01:36.719" style="s2">reason why I use from ways of talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.920" end="00:01:38.909" style="s2">about it although I supplement it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.719" end="00:01:41.670" style="s2">with with Boober and with Collingwood</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.909" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">right I think that it&#39;s a very clear and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.670" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">concise way of talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">so Fromm&#39;s idea is that right first of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:50.549" style="s2">all we have to get this notion of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">existential mode right so when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.549" end="00:01:54.240" style="s2">talking about an existential mode I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:56.999" style="s2">talking about this process of Co</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.240" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">identification right I&#39;m always assuming</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.999" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">a particular identity in order to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:04.289" style="s2">exercise my agency and I&#39;m projecting</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:06.179" style="s2">onto the world I set set of identities</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.289" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">in order to make that world an</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.179" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">intelligible arena for my action and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">those and this is also related to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:16.530" style="s2">know clifford geertz his work on</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:19.050" style="s2">worldviews right but that that deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.530" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">participatory relationship the way they</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.050" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">Co define and co-create each other yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the existential mode and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:27.260" style="s2">that what Fromm was pointing out is we</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.620" end="00:02:29.940" style="s2">have two fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.260" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">existential modes and these modes these</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.940" end="00:02:35.190" style="s2">agent arena Co fitting relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:37.380" style="s2">organized around different sets of needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.190" end="00:02:40.730" style="s2">we have and so they&#39;re having needs our</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.380" end="00:02:43.970" style="s2">needs that are met by having things</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.730" end="00:02:46.230" style="s2">exercising control over them ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.970" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">often ultimately consuming them like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.230" end="00:02:51.239" style="s2">oxygen food water or at least having</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:55.079" style="s2">really intimate control over them like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.239" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">shelter etc right and then Fromm&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.079" end="00:03:00.269" style="s2">notion is well those are first of all</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:02.579" style="s2">neither mode is right or wrong okay yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.269" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">but the having mode is right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.579" end="00:03:05.819" style="s2">legitimate mode because we do have these</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:08.069" style="s2">needs there&#39;s things we literally have</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.819" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">to consume and have power and control</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.069" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">over or we cease to be yes and then he</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">asked a really good question like what</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.049" style="s2">like what is your cognitive machinery</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:22.620" style="s2">like right and what&#39;s your existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.049" end="00:03:24.690" style="s2">mode like in order to facilitate solving</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.620" end="00:03:26.670" style="s2">this we says well what you do is you and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.690" end="00:03:28.290" style="s2">here I&#39;ll use some Collingwood ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.670" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">make it a little bit clearer but what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.290" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">do is I give things a categorical</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:38.069" style="s2">identity like this is a glass right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:40.079" style="s2">so III can quickly and efficiently know</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.069" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">know how to get control over it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.079" end="00:03:44.639" style="s2">manipulate it because I can put it into</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">a category and I can use the way in</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.639" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">which it&#39;s similar to all the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:50.400" style="s2">glasses and the way I could replace this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:53.609" style="s2">with another glass so all of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.400" end="00:03:55.319" style="s2">ability sign a categorical identity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.609" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">then that tells you what my relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.319" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">is to it my relationship is one of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:01.440" style="s2">know what Fromm calls like animal</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:03.630" style="s2">intelligence that that that&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.440" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">insult by the way right it means my</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.630" end="00:04:08.639" style="s2">tremendous capacity to manipulate things</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">in the world in order to write to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.639" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">my having needs so I have an i it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:15.209" style="s2">relationships of things to use an idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">from Boober</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.209" end="00:04:19.889" style="s2">now then Fromm pointed out but we have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">different set of needs he calls them</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.889" end="00:04:24.570" style="s2">being needs I sometimes think that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">might be more accurate to call them</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.570" end="00:04:29.699" style="s2">becoming needs or developmental needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:31.680" style="s2">so we have a need to be mature we need</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.699" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">to we have a need to become mature to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.680" end="00:04:37.169" style="s2">develop maturity we have a need to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">know become virtuous we need to you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.169" end="00:04:40.710" style="s2">we have a need to become authentic these</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">are these are things we need to become</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.710" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">so these are not these needs are not met</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:48.389" style="s2">by controlling or manipulating these are</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:49.560" style="s2">needs that are met through and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.389" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">back to something we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.560" end="00:04:52.889" style="s2">not that long ago these needs are met by</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:54.900" style="s2">going through important developmental</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.889" end="00:04:57.120" style="s2">transformations yes in in really</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.900" end="00:04:58.470" style="s2">important ways coming up with ways in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.120" end="00:05:00.870" style="s2">which we overcome that existential</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">inertia that that existential ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.870" end="00:05:06.570" style="s2">and fundamentally go through a process</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">of self transcendence and so the being</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.570" end="00:05:10.860" style="s2">needs are met</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">therefore by a different framework of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.860" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">cognition because now I&#39;m not primarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">trying to solve problems in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:21.780" style="s2">come up with an answer of how to quickly</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.510" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">get my goal instead what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.780" end="00:05:28.110" style="s2">do is connect myself to reality like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:29.699" style="s2">the reality of who I am and the reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.110" end="00:05:32.190" style="s2">out there so that I can get this</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.699" end="00:05:35.010" style="s2">reciprocal realization so that I and the</p>

<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:44.610" style="s2">a different you know cognitive agent so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.820" end="00:05:46.320" style="s2">my relationship now is not one of animal</p>

<p begin="00:07:32.590" end="00:07:36.520" style="s2">been with like that gives me information</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.780" end="00:07:38.740" style="s2">so that I can efficiently and</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.169" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">needs like that is not making this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.240" end="00:07:48.820" style="s2">relationship go well I&#39;m destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.710" style="s2">relationship because that is not why she</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.820" end="00:07:53.320" style="s2">has entered into this relationship right</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.710" end="00:07:55.590" style="s2">she&#39;s not entered into it to solve a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.320" end="00:07:58.419" style="s2">problem to have control over resources</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.590" end="00:08:00.520" style="s2">she&#39;s entered into it to become a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.419" end="00:08:03.430" style="s2">different person and that is of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.520" end="00:08:07.050" style="s2">why I&#39;ve also entered into it so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.430" end="00:08:11.200" style="s2">the issue then both modes are legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.050" end="00:08:13.180" style="s2">what from and I would argue and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.200" end="00:08:14.620" style="s2">what Stephen Bachelor argues you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.180" end="00:08:17.590" style="s2">what Buddhism and many things are</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.620" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">talking about is modal confusion when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.590" end="00:08:23.289" style="s2">confuse when we pursue right we use the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:25.300" style="s2">wrong mode to pursue the needs were</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.289" end="00:08:28.690" style="s2">pursuing and the classic example that</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.300" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">Fromm uses is we pursue the being needs</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:33.969" style="s2">from within the having mode so that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:39.159" style="s2">know in order to become mature we have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.969" end="00:08:42.849" style="s2">car in order to be in love we have lots</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.159" end="00:08:47.620" style="s2">of sex right right and and and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.849" end="00:08:50.980" style="s2">we can proms point right is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.620" end="00:08:53.170" style="s2">confusion serves other people in their</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.980" end="00:08:54.580" style="s2">capacity to exploit and manipulate us</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.170" end="00:08:57.160" style="s2">because if I can keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.580" end="00:08:59.140" style="s2">you trapped in the having mode you are</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.160" end="00:09:01.030" style="s2">of course we are being frustrated and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.140" end="00:09:02.500" style="s2">mean at an a deep existential and</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.030" end="00:09:04.030" style="s2">psychological sense you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.500" end="00:09:06.550" style="s2">frustrated in your attempt to satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.030" end="00:09:07.990" style="s2">your being needs so you what would you</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.550" end="00:09:10.420" style="s2">do you&#39;re trapped in the having mode and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.990" end="00:09:12.160" style="s2">having the car isn&#39;t doing it so it must</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.420" end="00:09:13.930" style="s2">mean that I don&#39;t have the right car or</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.160" end="00:09:16.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve got to get a new car or a new</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.930" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">iPhone or right or I&#39;ve got to get more</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">likes I have to have more likes on my</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:23.980" style="s2">social media and so you pursue this with</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:25.630" style="s2">an increasing frenzy and then Fromm</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.980" end="00:09:28.750" style="s2">predicts there&#39;s two responses to that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.630" end="00:09:31.030" style="s2">like the the the the futility and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.750" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">frustration bifurcate and you either</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.030" end="00:09:36.930" style="s2">fall into a kind of deep despair or you</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:39.340" style="s2">that that frustration and futility</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.930" end="00:09:41.980" style="s2">reaches out in the only way in which you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.340" end="00:09:44.110" style="s2">feel you can again reconnect to reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.980" end="00:09:46.960" style="s2">which is sort of a violent you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.110" end="00:09:50.140" style="s2">reaction anger and you know attacking</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.960" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">those around you because that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.140" end="00:09:55.090" style="s2">the last resort you have to at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:55.270" style="s2">reconnect to reality in some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.090" end="00:09:57.940" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.270" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">so the modal confusion is a profound way</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.940" end="00:10:05.620" style="s2">in which we can be deceived and and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:09.430" style="s2">that deception also makes us X you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.620" end="00:10:12.340" style="s2">quite exceptionally vulnerable to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.430" end="00:10:13.900" style="s2">manipulation by others beautiful thank</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.340" end="00:10:17.520" style="s2">you very much for taking us through that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.900" end="00:10:17.520" style="s2">I think it&#39;s incredibly valuable</p>
