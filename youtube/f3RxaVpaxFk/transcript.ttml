<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">oh no oh no i don&#39;t know how to start</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">technical difficulty anyway i&#39;ll we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">just start with the interest rates</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">yeah um so my name is turn as peter said</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">and uh i um until recently i was working</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:36.160" style="s2">as editor of emerge which some of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">might be familiar with through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.160" end="00:02:39.280" style="s2">emerge podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:41.200" style="s2">which is kind of loosely associated with</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.280" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">us and uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.200" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s what i&#39;ve been doing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">i think my entrance into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">into this world was kind of atypical in</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">i had didn&#39;t really know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">it until i had</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">was paid to learn about it and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:58.000" style="s2">uh yeah which is definitely typical in</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">that i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.000" end="00:03:01.360" style="s2">come into this scene because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">working in jobs where they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.360" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">paid to do something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">inspire them and</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">so i had a real quick learning uh curve</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">when i first started working at emerge</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">and previously to that i think i i came</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">from this background that was quite um</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">typical of someone in my generation it</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">was quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">post-modern and was very concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:24.159" style="s2">being woke</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">and kind of and then when i arrived in</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.159" end="00:03:30.560" style="s2">the scene i um</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:33.120" style="s2">i kind of that was all deconstructed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.560" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">and i saw i think i went on a journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.120" end="00:03:37.920" style="s2">that was quite similar to what we need</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">people to go on or we need a group of</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.920" end="00:03:40.480" style="s2">people to go on</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">in order to kind of make the change we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.480" end="00:03:45.440" style="s2">want to see in the world um</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">kind of real um and so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.440" end="00:03:51.120" style="s2">yeah cool um my journey</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:53.200" style="s2">towards my modernities and game b was</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.120" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">quite different</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.200" end="00:03:57.360" style="s2">but probably more similar to most of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">people here so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">i was actually a law student and was</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:04.000" style="s2">like fully in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:05.439" style="s2">game a hustle um</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.000" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">and then i discovered that was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.439" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">miserable so i just kind of like fell</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">down the internet rabbit hole</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">um the twitter ready podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">um and got sucked into it</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:20.000" style="s2">and i think i had an experience that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">many people can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.000" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">that essentially is at the fir at first</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">you&#39;re just so fascinated because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">find these people that look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:29.680" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">the similar lenses that you had but um</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.680" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">more meta</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re seeing the same problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:34.960" style="s2">that you do and they feel similar than</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">than you do</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.960" end="00:04:38.560" style="s2">um and this generates a lot of initial</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">excitement</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.560" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">and then when you find the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">community when you realize that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.880" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">just like not only a few people</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.479" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:53.120" style="s2">i think like a scene that&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.120" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">but then i i also started working</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:02.639" style="s2">at emerge that&#39;s how tarn and i met in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:06.320" style="s2">berlin where we are right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.639" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">um but then during this journey</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.320" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">i also saw some of the problems and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">got some</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">some of the disillusionment that i see</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:16.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">people are also bringing up and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.000" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">what we want to talk about today but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:23.120" style="s2">we we want to address these from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.120" end="00:05:26.479" style="s2">that we are in the same team like even</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">though we&#39;re criticizing the only reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.479" end="00:05:30.800" style="s2">why we&#39;re criticizing is because we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:31.840" style="s2">to see this movement and we if we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.800" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">call it this way</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.840" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">reach its maximum potential</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:38.800" style="s2">so yeah everything coming from a place</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">of love</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.800" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">but we still need to talk it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">yeah so yeah okay um what did we do for</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:49.759" style="s2">these presentations</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">tarn um yeah we had a problem yeah so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">actually spent quite a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">um i mean so coming back to um</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">to who we are i when i first met ellie</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:05:59.840" style="s2">it was the first time i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">really had the opportunity to bounce you</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.840" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">know i came from this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">um this background of a feminist theory</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">that was really my</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">my thing when i was at uni i was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:11.039" style="s2">from a very feminist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">and then i arrived in the scene which</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:15.919" style="s2">was kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">critiquing the um the culture the kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.919" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">of culture was and i could see</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">how needed that was but i wasn&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">kind of marry these two perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">until i met ellie and it was the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.960" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">time i&#39;d ever really been able to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">okay uh you know i get that what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:31.039" style="s2">on in feminism is problematic right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">but also does that mean that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.039" end="00:06:34.319" style="s2">the only people that we listen to now</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">are men</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.319" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">um yeah so it was kind of this was the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:38.960" style="s2">first time i&#39;d ever really been able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">bounce</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.960" end="00:06:42.080" style="s2">ideas off someone and have them</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">reflected back at me and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.080" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">i think because we come from a similar</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">subculture</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">yeah exactly yeah we were able to bond</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">in this seeing someone that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">you and not just for</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">representation issues like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">the main</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">problem that we&#39;re trying to address but</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.599" style="s2">feeling that you&#39;re seeing in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">experience and that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.599" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">to talk with someone that like really</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">understands where you&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">not just being a woman but being young</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">in this case like also european uh from</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">a movement that tends to be like quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">u.s centric</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">um yeah we also wanted to say at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">beginning we kind of like skipped this</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.160" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">but oh yeah yeah yeah that what happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.160" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">is that we had this like presentation</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">at dawn at the beginning and then we</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">realized that we were</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">falling into the same problem that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:34.080" style="s2">were trying to criticize essentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:37.199" style="s2">that we want to bring up some problems</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.080" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">um but that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.199" end="00:07:40.960" style="s2">already acknowledging and we were not</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">bringing like something truly fresh</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.960" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">so then we just decided to go a bit on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">different way and that&#39;s why we decided</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">do the memes um for this presentation</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.599" style="s2">because i feel like they are very</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:52.160" style="s2">good new ways of communicating and some</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.599" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.160" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">problems that we want to tackle in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:58.560" style="s2">end and what means oh hi</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">memes because they&#39;re funny and i love</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.560" end="00:08:02.479" style="s2">um and we need more humor totally like</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.479" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">that&#39;s for one but also because i feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:08.639" style="s2">that memes are truly</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">the new form of communication of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.639" end="00:08:12.960" style="s2">21st century</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">they are so powerful they have so much</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.960" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">cultural information ingrained in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">and because they have this like visual</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:21.120" style="s2">aid</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">but also with text you have the an</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.120" end="00:08:24.080" style="s2">emotional reaction that you just see</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">with the with the person and this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.080" end="00:08:27.280" style="s2">what creates the connection to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">embody part of the conversation that we</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.280" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">sometimes miss</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.000" style="s2">or or say that&#39;s lacking when you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">you know you see like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.000" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">pablo escobar like he&#39;s like feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:36.479" style="s2">like really sad and that&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">how i felt this morning like wow</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">i didn&#39;t know this conversation and if i</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">follow me and also this sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">of we&#39;re mapping out how the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">ideally would look like if we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">in say like 30 years but we&#39;re still in</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">today we&#39;re still like</p>

<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">the next step and for me that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:27.279" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">as someone who got into these</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.279" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">um thinking from when i was quite young</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">like 20 or 21</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">and i still had my whole career ahead of</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">generated a lot of anxiety for me this</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:43.839" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">but um yeah yeah and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.839" end="00:10:46.560" style="s2">we&#39;re just gonna quickly go through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">problems but then talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.560" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">solutions we just have them</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:53.279" style="s2">down here then</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:55.120" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s the fact that these</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.279" end="00:10:57.839" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.120" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">seem to be a lot a one-way conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.839" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">the heroes the sense makers the chief um</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">yeah sense makers and then everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">that we were so eagerly</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">um following them and created this kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:10.560" style="s2">of like personality called which is fine</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.560" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">i get it because they do have very</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:15.839" style="s2">insightful things to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">but if we&#39;re talking sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.839" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">sense making is something that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">collectively and every person is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">a sensor</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:26.079" style="s2">and that has some noise and some signal</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">in in in the jargon we need as many</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">sensors as we can in order to have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">best since making possible in order to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:33.519" style="s2">like have the most complete</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:35.200" style="s2">picture of reality but then again what</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.519" end="00:11:37.600" style="s2">time was saying</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.200" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">we fell into this same we felt that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.600" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">perhaps transcended postmodernism</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">but where were the women where are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">different people</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.760" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">and it&#39;s not just about women</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:51.760" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not it&#39;s not coming at it from</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">this perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.760" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">identity politics and it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.320" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">ways of thinking different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">constructing meaning different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.040" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">talking and even interacting</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">and we are we&#39;re aware that we we talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:06.880" style="s2">in a very different way</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">than people sometimes come on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.880" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s just about being able to then</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:15.440" style="s2">arrive in these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:17.279" style="s2">and and kind of find the the symbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.800" style="s2">find the space in between</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.279" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">in order to come up with kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.800" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">solutions that we need to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">problems that we&#39;re all facing</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:29.200" style="s2">exactly and different ways of showing up</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not just enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.200" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">you know the very diverse picture but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:34.800" style="s2">just do you come up with</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">like your vulnerability that you come up</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.800" end="00:12:39.839" style="s2">with humor do you come</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:41.680" style="s2">with you know a more like less</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.839" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">intellectual way of speaking but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.680" end="00:12:44.160" style="s2">still very</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">embodied and resonating with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.160" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">people like which essentially we all</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.399" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">have a framework that we&#39;ve constructed</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">that we feel is very powerful which are</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">all the different ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">all the different tools that we can make</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">sure this</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:13:00.240" style="s2">framework is worldview gets to the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">people as possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.240" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">um so yeah yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">one part yeah i think that&#39;s uh-huh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">yeah you didn&#39;t move yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.000" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">okay then a big part of culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.160" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">culture change i mean what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">when we talk about culture change</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">um well ellie was bringing up with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">with the means</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.639" style="s2">with the memes and this is why we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.079" style="s2">decided to kind of meme this entire</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.639" end="00:13:30.240" style="s2">conversation because</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.079" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">as this meme says we could speak about</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.240" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">this for like 10 minutes and probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">give you the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">intellectual understanding of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:37.519" style="s2">saying as just looking at this meme</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">against you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">exactly um and this is why we need to</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:43.440" style="s2">kind of find</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">these ways of communicating these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">yeah in essence these me my feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.600" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">represents</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:53.120" style="s2">what the whole conversation could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">like is culture change or is it just</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.120" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">like an hour-long podcast conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:58.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to have the theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.800" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">and to have the sense making in a way</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">kind of like furnishes your brain i feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">but we need to distinguish between</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.959" style="s2">the kind of knowledge that is um let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">say classificatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.959" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">versus a kind of knowledge that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">generative that really creates uh can</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">culture chains and i feel like there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:27.760" style="s2">was um a lot of resistance towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">making things popular making things</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.760" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">mainstream and i get that yeah sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">when</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">a product that&#39;s very pure which is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">mainstream it can get corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">but we need to find the ways of playing</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:41.040" style="s2">with the system in order to reach</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">um all the people that we want to reach</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.040" end="00:14:46.000" style="s2">and to make this a truly a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.839" style="s2">global movement you were saying this</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.000" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">thing about climate change before when</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.839" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">um yes um</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">i was saying that i get the sense i mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">we live in this kind of we</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">live in a culture where there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:04.959" style="s2">fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:06.399" style="s2">movements um and when last year when</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.959" end="00:15:07.760" style="s2">the kind of extinction rebellion stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.399" end="00:15:08.079" style="s2">kicked off there was this kind of sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.760" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.079" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">oh finally there&#39;s a kind of global</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">movement that we can all get behind</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:14.880" style="s2">and this is this has the same potential</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">i mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.880" end="00:15:18.320" style="s2">things have evolved since that um</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">original kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.320" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">fervor behind um extinction rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">i think this this has the potential to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.240" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">have the same kind of uniting</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:30.399" style="s2">yeah united potential and in a time</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.399" end="00:15:34.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like where the time right now feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">extremely ripe for these kinds of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.800" end="00:15:38.800" style="s2">we&#39;re saying before that when corona</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:41.839" style="s2">came this fight</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.800" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">it is objectively quite bad and our</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.839" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">lifestyle gets definitely negatively</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">impacted</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:52.079" style="s2">it also felt like a kind of relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">yeah it was a really great opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">opening up</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.199" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">a lot of excitement because it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.720" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">felt like we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">systemic breakdown and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">collapsed for a while and it was finally</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">like other people were starting to kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">feel it as well and it was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">permeating our daily</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">our daily lives and so yeah the overton</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">window is open and it&#39;s and it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:21.199" style="s2">it it&#39;s a good time to really be</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">thinking about how</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.199" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">to spread these ideas further exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">and it felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">like it became more obvious that all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">previous pathways that had been</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.160" style="s2">tried and tested were not working</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:36.399" style="s2">anymore so it was a time where people</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.160" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a time where it feels that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.399" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">collectively is like way more open to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">being truly radical</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">and brave and experimental in how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:47.360" style="s2">bringing about change</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">um so yeah that&#39;s how we should approach</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.360" end="00:16:50.720" style="s2">also the issue of culture change i hear</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">i make</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.720" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">yeah a bit of the differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">between the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">system builders so those are like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:01.120" style="s2">people who are actually building</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">say the economic educational um</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.120" end="00:17:05.919" style="s2">political systems that we&#39;re ingraining</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:08.799" style="s2">versus the culture changes these are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.919" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">people that create the imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.799" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">culture in general and this is more in</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">the artistic creative domain and how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.959" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:19.280" style="s2">collaborate between these people</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.959" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s like essays are</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.280" end="00:17:23.600" style="s2">very important these are part of theory</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">but which new ways of bringing this like</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.600" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">theory down to the masses can we</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:32.480" style="s2">um yeah but this is very hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">if all your theory and all of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.480" end="00:17:39.120" style="s2">message is just completely wrapped in</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:42.480" style="s2">jargon in group jargon</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">yeah um yeah we had</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.480" end="00:17:45.039" style="s2">we&#39;ve had an interesting experience with</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:46.640" style="s2">this the past weeks because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.039" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">scripting a podcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.640" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">uh series and so what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">is take</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:56.160" style="s2">the theory that we that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">we know we&#39;ve come across and um bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.160" end="00:17:58.720" style="s2">it down</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">to you know literally this physical act</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.720" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">of kind of bringing it down to real</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">real world examples real um real</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">cultural examples</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">um and then we would get like wrapped</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">into these like mine spins because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">were like</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.400" style="s2">is that like is that what it is i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.000" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.400" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">yeah and it was it&#39;s this kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">really realize through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">trying to make something</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:23.120" style="s2">tangible how much</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">how much is implicit um in a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.120" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">very conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">thinking and sometimes how little you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:32.320" style="s2">actually know</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.520" style="s2">sometimes it felt or you may know that</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.320" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">you need to like really</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.520" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">bring it out sometimes it felt like</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">trying to pin down a dream</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:40.640" style="s2">when you use jargon where you use like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">these like highly complex phrases</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.640" end="00:18:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just like oh yeah and of course it</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:46.000" style="s2">resonates it&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.679" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">right but then when you&#39;re trying to pin</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">it down to essentially like what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like trying to remember a dream</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">that you like dreamt last night it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why even though sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">jargon makes us sound extremely smart</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">um the smartest way or like how we</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">actually sound smarter</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">is when we&#39;re just being crisp and clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:12.000" style="s2">in what you want what we want to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:15.039" style="s2">especially if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.000" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">um yeah creating things from the ground</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.039" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">up but we were seeing that when we were</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">doing business proposals</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">that it was so easy to get caught up</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">into the rhetoric but it was really hard</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">say what we wanted to do well jargon</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">serves</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:29.039" style="s2">purposefully because it can it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">bringing um</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.039" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">it is kind of naming things that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">don&#39;t already exist</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">and and kind of giving them making them</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">embodied</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">creating a new concept for them like no</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">idea that yeah and also it can be an</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">in-group identifier so you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">who vibes with you who&#39;s reading the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">same things as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:50.000" style="s2">listen to the same podcast and in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">really really complex world</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.000" end="00:19:53.919" style="s2">um it&#39;s it&#39;s even more important because</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">we live in this such</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.919" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">scattered information apology where you</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:19:58.880" style="s2">know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">you kind of it&#39;s kind of instinctive to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.880" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">want to know who your tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">um yet you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily going to do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">purpose of a kind of wide scale culture</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">change that</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about um yeah and about 10</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">minutes so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">oh we&#39;ve got 10 minutes okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:19.679" style="s2">all right so this is just yeah another</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">illustration</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.679" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">of of like how you can speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:30.480" style="s2">in turkey yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">so yeah enough we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">this is a description of this this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.799" end="00:20:43.919" style="s2">the description of the session</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">i think exactly it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:49.840" style="s2">jargon yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">serves this like community purpose that</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.840" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">completely um disposable</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">yeah we had a lot of fun writing this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.159" style="s2">because it was actually fun writing in</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:20:59.600" style="s2">the jargon and we understood it all so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.159" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2">we were kind of like we were like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.600" end="00:21:03.840" style="s2">and then we were like no no</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">this is this is supposed to be funny</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.840" end="00:21:07.679" style="s2">because we were kind of also kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.679" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">yeah um but if</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.799" style="s2">i was to say like something really good</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">that this team has created in the first</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.799" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">place is that it has</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.159" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">created a sense of community of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:21.919" style="s2">people that felt</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:23.440" style="s2">alone before they did really like who</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.919" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">are the people that see the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">through the same lenses as we do and i</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">felt like that that&#39;s what i was drawn</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:30.799" style="s2">to in the first place and just having</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.799" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">feeling that you&#39;re not alone that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">there&#39;s more people like you they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">the only weirdo out there</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:39.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s extremely positive and then i</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">can understand how this</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.200" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">reinforces the use of jargon because</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">it&#39;s this like signifier like cultural</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">signifier</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:47.360" style="s2">that we belong we&#39;re in the same tribe</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">um but ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.360" end="00:21:50.960" style="s2">it comes back to is about conditions</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly it just creates the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.960" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">conditions so</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">yeah we just wanted to analyze it to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">science um</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:01.840" style="s2">next okay but enough sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:02.960" style="s2">criticizing then we will just fall into</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.840" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">the same trap we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.960" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">so good at analyzing but not that good</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">at solution creation and we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">out of time</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">not just like in the session but also</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">like in broader context scale like we</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">are running out of time guys</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">for so we need to think of solutions we</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">are in the solutions department</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">um this is this could be i mean we had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">brief conversation with peter before</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:26.559" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">this is a much bigger conversation than</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.559" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">what we&#39;re able to cover in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">in this session and we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">ideas um but this is just kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:42.960" style="s2">then in the end even though if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.120" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">the ideal solution we need to be aware</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.960" end="00:24:45.679" style="s2">that we</p>

<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">can like choose the ideal and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">play with culture and if that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">being a bit less pure but it works in</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">regards to the impact</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:57.520" style="s2">then we need to recognize that at some</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">point we need to have some metrics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.520" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.480" end="00:25:02.159" style="s2">see like yeah is it are we only in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:03.360" style="s2">business of like being purist and like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.159" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">making the most sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.360" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">theory and we might be but then we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">to recognize that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:10.080" style="s2">at least like not putting our shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:13.200" style="s2">and metal off like oh no here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.080" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">no system changers yeah um and</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:24.159" style="s2">then another part</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:27.600" style="s2">um of culture change is influencers</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.159" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">yeah okay about influencers</p>

<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">influencer</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.760" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">within me brings up a lot of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">it&#39;s strange it&#39;s good for me too</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">who are kind of playing the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">extremely egotistical</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">and and sort of self-absorbed and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:49.200" style="s2">is a lot of influence or culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">and i think this uh this meme really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.200" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">sums up</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.000" style="s2">the different levels that you can think</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:56.799" style="s2">about um influences yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.000" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">i feel like like a lot of people even</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.799" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">maybe perhaps like the influencers</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">association of like influencers being</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">the basic [ __ ] and like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">yeah the most basic way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:09.039" style="s2">about them but then you just realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">like the system that they&#39;re ingrained</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.039" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">in and then there&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.720" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">yeah and then recognizing as you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.960" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">viable it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">i think they did they did a study on</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">teenagers and it used to be that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:27.760" style="s2">they wanted to be doctors and they</p>

<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:35.679" style="s2">kind of seen as a viable career choice</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:38.000" style="s2">for young people and that is the culture</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.679" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">that we&#39;re living in um</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.000" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">and so how do we work instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:43.919" style="s2">critiquing this and</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">and kind of piling judgment on it how do</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.919" end="00:26:49.200" style="s2">we work with that system</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:52.799" style="s2">um yeah and not only that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.200" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">feels so in a way because</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.840" end="00:27:53.760" style="s2">people that we have there the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.520" end="00:27:56.480" style="s2">they are the ones that like represent</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">what we think of as elite in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.480" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s just like not one</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">monoculture we live in a globalized</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:04.000" style="s2">society like hyper society that we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">a lot of subcultures</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.000" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">and the difference influencers represent</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">um the different values that these</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">subcultures have</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">but how do we play um with the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">how do we play with the senses and not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:18.360" style="s2">against it and in this way creating</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">these like new</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.360" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">representations truly embodied because</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what influencers are like</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">embodied values</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">and that society of health so like how</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.159" style="s2">would this representation look like</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">yeah and i think this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.159" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen a bit of in the modern scene</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">hansi kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">uh alter ego and i think that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">an awareness of the power of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">archetypal um</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">personality exactly and yeah with hands</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like super intellectual but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:51.720" style="s2">could be even</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">something like very subtle but it just</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.720" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">transpires</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">um the values or like the even like</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">sensibilities that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">in a very subtle way</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">but the thing about subtlety and showing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">something rather than</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">explicitly telling and explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">telling the theory</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">is because when you get it then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:10.720" style="s2">just like connecting with</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:12.320" style="s2">through emotion and that&#39;s when it</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.720" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">becomes like directly embodied</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.320" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">even though it means that maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.919" style="s2">consciously rationally</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">are not even aware of what you&#39;re um</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.919" end="00:29:21.840" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.320" style="s2">so yeah i think that&#39;s that&#39;s it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.840" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.320" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">perfect timing yeah oh yeah yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">just</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">the stoic daddy holy [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.360" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">thing that we were joking up before and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">related to i&#39;ll i&#39;ll stop for you uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">yeah stop description</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">yeah uh we were talking about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">like vibe</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">like how vibe is different from content</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">um and you can kind of say the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:22.799" style="s2">thing propositionally but you can say</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">like with a different vibe it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.799" end="00:30:27.200" style="s2">resonate with people more</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.240" style="s2">um and like for example like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.200" end="00:30:30.559" style="s2">game b scene</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.240" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">like i can interface with their</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.559" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">propositions i i like them i learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:35.840" style="s2">but i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">buy that that that scene it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.840" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">it feels kind of icky a lot of fanboying</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:40.960" style="s2">fangirling going on there</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">or with like the stoicism movement</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.960" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">there&#39;s only like one stoic in the stone</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:44.880" style="s2">that&#39;s me</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">and i don&#39;t really vibe with the modern</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.880" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">stoic movement it just feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">disembodied and so the store has</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">cultivated its own</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">vibe and a lot of people are vibing with</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">it but everyone&#39;s gonna vibe with it</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">right so this like this idea that we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">have a vibe diversity</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;re gesturing at so i was</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">wondering if you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">maybe speak on this like mono vibing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">that&#39;s occurring in the scene versus</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">like cultivating a vibe diversity</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:10.640" style="s2">yeah i really like looking at it through</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:12.799" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.640" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">permaculture principle of diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.799" end="00:31:17.200" style="s2">and how and if you have a monoculture</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">for if you have a monoculture of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.200" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">is you get a sense of safety and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">community but</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:22.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get the soil the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">rich soil that you need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.960" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">to grow rich solutions</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">and i think if you have a kind of strong</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">different ecosystem of thought than you</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.799" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">will then you will create richer soil</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">and in different vibes and i like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">system of vines yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">biodiversity is great and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">this and the reason why it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">difficult is that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">it creates conflict and and it means</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">that you have to be comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">being uncomfortable in a way that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">you you know because we talk about being</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:56.880" style="s2">comfortable with being uncomfortable a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">lot in in this</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.880" end="00:32:00.480" style="s2">scene but in a different way in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:02.880" style="s2">different way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.480" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">you can&#39;t anticipate yet and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.880" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">to have a diversity of vibes and still</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">you know disarm your judgment and disarm</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">your superiority complex in your library</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.039" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">yeah yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:21.840" style="s2">um do you have any anything about on</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:24.480" style="s2">that early</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.840" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">well yeah especially the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.480" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">bikes resonate with different people and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">that abide</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:30.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">how to say um</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">each vibe like serves a different kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">and there&#39;s no like better vibes and</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">like bad vibes in here like the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">that comes to my head</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">is when people used to criticize um</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:50.799" style="s2">techno like techno music and electronic</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.799" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">saying that oh this is not good music</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">this is just sound</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">and then like this dj the answer that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">he came up with was like the people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">criticized this they don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">the context in which is meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">and so i think that this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">it&#39;s because yeah of course like you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">would it&#39;s like classical music</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">or like normal speaker and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">that is the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">with vibes like each bag</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">works in a certain context and like</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">serves a specific purpose and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">about like which fight</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:28.880" style="s2">is that&#39;s better like which way is not</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:31.919" style="s2">better is that we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.880" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">to make space and that&#39;s what i refer to</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.919" end="00:33:35.760" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">metamodernism gaming distance making is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.760" end="00:33:39.440" style="s2">being a framework</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">and that framework like the purpose that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.440" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">it should serve is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:44.399" style="s2">open up for all these different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">apps it&#39;s just kind of like the os</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.399" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">that you have in body and then you come</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">up as your authentic self with</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">it but it&#39;s just it&#39;s not a way of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:56.240" style="s2">not a personality</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">right and we&#39;ve kind of associated</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.240" end="00:34:00.159" style="s2">um the sense making scene with a type of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">personality but that&#39;s just because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.159" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">first people that came there like had</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:04.399" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">and also because then this creates an</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.399" end="00:34:07.279" style="s2">attractor that it feels that you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">only be part of this if you have this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.279" end="00:34:10.000" style="s2">personality</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">but that&#39;s just it&#39;s completely [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.000" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">like it&#39;s just not true and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:13.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:15.280" style="s2">way that it can work the best the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.839" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">that it can work the best this is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.280" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">the os</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">you have it within you that&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">bill that you have and then you create</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">your you just show up as your authentic</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.839" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">self with the bite that you resonate</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:25.679" style="s2">most and then you find the others and</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:29.839" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.679" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">pollinate in that way so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.839" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">yeah yeah i like that a lot um and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:34.960" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">is what we were talking about before we</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.960" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">let people in about embodiment and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">session high pitch with bonita nora rhea</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">um and how when i was there i just</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">felt embodied listening to them they</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">were like six ladies talking and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:51.040" style="s2">was it</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">i just felt so embodied but i also the</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.040" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">content was rich as well</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:55.599" style="s2">and then uh so there&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">embodiment vibe there which i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.599" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:35:00.240" style="s2">your thoughts on and then right after</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">that uh greg henriquez zack stein and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.240" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">jordan hall had a session</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">it was like you know escape velocity</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">meta like all this like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:07.839" style="s2">galaxy brain stuff and it was good but</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">it was a totally different vibe</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.839" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">um and i do think it&#39;s a wrong move to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">kind of shame that that that vibe</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:15.440" style="s2">because that&#39;s an onboarding point for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:17.040" style="s2">lot of people as well</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.440" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">and so i&#39;m curious uh what you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">about this like an embodiment vibe and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">maybe how it relates to</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:23.280" style="s2">women and femininity uh and how it could</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">interface with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.280" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">more meta uh disembodied vibe</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">this is something that i&#39;ve coming</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:37.200" style="s2">personally and having worked</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">in this and i i feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.200" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">quite a feminine essence person in order</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:43.440" style="s2">to be able to kind of intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.599" style="s2">um to speak in an intellectual way or to</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.440" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">speak in this meta level i have to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.599" end="00:35:49.520" style="s2">felt a heart connection and an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">connection first and i really struggle</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.520" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">in these</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">environments where um where the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">is just to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.240" style="s2">kind of present and kind of put your put</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">your ideas out there and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">and be um be one of the heroes</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">um and i i don&#39;t i need to be embodied</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:07.520" style="s2">in order to</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">in order to access it and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.520" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:12.560" style="s2">something that i&#39;ve experienced and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.560" style="s2">was lacking and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.560" end="00:36:15.599" style="s2">and yeah exactly like this feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">being embodied</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.599" end="00:36:18.880" style="s2">that i also got from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:21.920" style="s2">conversation with nora</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.880" end="00:36:23.599" style="s2">and juanita and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.920" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">helps people to feel grounded and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.599" end="00:36:30.240" style="s2">comfortable and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">yeah absolutely and also sometimes when</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.240" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">i see these like hyper intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:37.520" style="s2">for me it&#39;s funny because i get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">feeling that the people</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.520" end="00:36:41.040" style="s2">that talk they don&#39;t think that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">don&#39;t seem disconnected</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.040" end="00:36:44.240" style="s2">right either like i i&#39;ve seen very</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">intellectual people</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.240" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">in real life and online but yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">they do come across as disconnected but</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:50.720" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:52.400" style="s2">fortunately like not the people like</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.720" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">jordan or like</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.400" end="00:36:56.400" style="s2">zac stein at least i don&#39;t yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:36:57.599" style="s2">danish mike burger like i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.400" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">them personally but the feeling that i</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.599" end="00:37:01.040" style="s2">have from them is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">they are integrated and embodied people</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.040" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">so then like how is it that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">created this</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:07.280" style="s2">environment that just brings out these</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">parts of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.280" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">um but then on the other side on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">embodied conversation the funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.640" end="00:37:14.240" style="s2">about embodied conversation or um</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:15.920" style="s2">embodied living of this is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.240" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">sometimes you don&#39;t even need the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">content reach</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">this is something that i think joe was</p>

<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">but we&#39;re not even like the same right</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.160" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">no no yeah i mean i don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">but yeah i mean we could go only cool</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.160" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">um so let&#39;s uh pivot to the chats now</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">uh right now heaven</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.800" style="s2">yeah so um peter that discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">you just were having uh kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.800" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">prefigured and touched on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">elements of my question but i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">going to go ahead and read it and let</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">you take it wherever you want um</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">so my question is a problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">sense making scene which i have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">and which</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">you also seem to have gestured at in</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">your presentation is that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">major players seem to generally conceive</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:06.240" style="s2">of or at least to like transmit a sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.240" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">sense making as a primarily intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">activity</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:12.560" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a heavy focus on</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">epistemology and similar framings</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.560" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">and to me this seems to allied the deep</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">mutually supporting and interdependent</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">relationship between skillful ways of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">relating to our embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">to our emotional experiences and to our</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.280" style="s2">intellectual capacities so</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">lots of people in the sense making seem</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.280" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">seen seem to have their own practices</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">and ways of skillfully relating to these</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">aspects of human experience but they</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">seem to under</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">emphasize the skills of embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">for lack of a more precise term a sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:40.880" style="s2">tantrically vibed way of skillfully</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">engaging with one&#39;s emotions</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.880" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">relative to the importance of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">things for good sense making and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">curious to hear your thoughts regarding</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">the ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">in which the sense making scene could</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">better emphasize the development of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">whole human which seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">necessary for truly excellent sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">making and choice-making</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">great question</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">the questions how can the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">seem better integrate an awareness or</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">integrate a kind of um awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:13.599" style="s2">importance of an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">and embodied way of making sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.599" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">um well yeah by doing exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:22.160" style="s2">by integrating it and having these kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:22.880" style="s2">of conversations that we&#39;re having now</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.160" end="00:43:25.119" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.880" end="00:43:26.319" style="s2">and like you say it&#39;s spoken about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.119" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s mentioned but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.319" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">i mean how do we</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">um how do we create spaces in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">people can physically have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">experience rather than just speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:35.680" style="s2">about it and this is something that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:37.280" style="s2">tried to do with the emerge gatherings</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.680" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">was to create these spaces where people</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.280" end="00:43:39.280" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:41.599" style="s2">could kind of have these embodied</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.280" end="00:43:44.720" style="s2">experiences but um you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.599" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">it it yeah it had its uh i</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.720" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">yeah i feel like this is essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:52.839" style="s2">social design</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">problem um because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.839" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">we carry these conversations and how we</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:43:59.040" style="s2">engage in these conversations and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.040" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">even though um we&#39;re so used to them</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">that we don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">has a specific design to it and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">design is that i talk you listen to me</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">and if this is like a conversation then</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:11.599" style="s2">i&#39;m the one that&#39;s talking and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">certain like social norms</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.599" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">of what is it accepted to say and like</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">not accepted to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">and how you should show up and how you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">should not show up and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">this is like the invisible code of</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:28.560" style="s2">so i feel like here the crucial um</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">like the crucial point that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.560" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">trying to look at in order to like shift</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:35.680" style="s2">these conversations to a more</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">um full human embodied uh way of of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:40.800" style="s2">being um would be to look at this code</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">and then experiment like create</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.800" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">conversational games</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:45.839" style="s2">so in this conversational game we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">gonna try to and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.839" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">pin down the values that we want um</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.280" style="s2">to try to experiment in that in in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:55.040" style="s2">like little conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.280" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">in this conversation we&#39;re going to try</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.040" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">to talk intellectually but</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">with vulnerability and then with a</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">social designer maybe this is something</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">that we could do in the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">um social design club at the store</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">redesigning um the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.119" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">it is actually a design problem that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">need to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:16.160" style="s2">we need to like pin down which are the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">values that we want to create and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.160" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">see see which are the methods that work</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:21.119" style="s2">best um</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:23.520" style="s2">and this is probably like not a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.119" end="00:45:28.319" style="s2">conversation that we should have</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.520" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">but like a doing a design session</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.319" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">yeah i love that and like the keys for</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.079" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">yeah i like that the idea of making it</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:40.720" style="s2">playful too you know like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:43.920" style="s2">that with the focus on these redesigning</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.720" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">these sense making conversations um so</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.920" end="00:45:46.960" style="s2">if you have any statements to that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:48.319" style="s2">like to say and just i will call on you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.960" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">as well he doesn&#39;t have to be a question</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.319" end="00:45:51.359" style="s2">uh cheryl you had a thought i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.359" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">good to share yeah i&#39;m happy to share</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">i love this session um what you were</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.720" style="s2">describing about</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:04.160" style="s2">your vibe being very irreverent and</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.720" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">playful i think i just</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.160" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">i found it very immediately disarming</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">i would say a scene that i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">curious about and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">adjacently attending a lot of talks</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">but i also haven&#39;t been feeling quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:20.480" style="s2">the vibe of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">even though i think a lot of the content</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.480" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">resonates</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">and just seeing the two of you show up</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.119" end="00:46:30.079" style="s2">be badass with your memes i think made</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">it feel frankly a lot more accessible</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.079" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">to me um so yeah i think there is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">real power to being able to</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.720" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">i think use humor especially to disarm</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">so thanks for that i just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">say we need more of you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">thank you so much that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">really great to hear</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">probably that would have been me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">any of these years back yeah so lively</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:06.319" style="s2">manuel you had a similar comment</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">need more of you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:23.200" style="s2">and i am one of you um the high</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">intellect was a part of my onboarding</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.200" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">via jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">and i i do appreciate all the</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">deliciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:34.319" style="s2">you know solar masculinity and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">big two dollar words that are banning</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.319" end="00:47:39.040" style="s2">about i think it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">my experience in um this empathy circle</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.040" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">technology we&#39;ve had for the last month</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">has been really interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:48.240" style="s2">sometimes um some of these super high</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:50.839" style="s2">intellect guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.240" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">they&#39;re just not being heard or not</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.839" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">connecting and they&#39;re they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">that absence</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">of like community toss and so i&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">a bit of like</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">sprouting there of like maybe i need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">restructure</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">how i show up so i can actually connect</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">with people</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">and not just display my intellect so</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s been interesting and then um as i</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">was able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">sort of onboard and and be messy</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">and sort of express myself and make</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">statements</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">now i&#39;m finding my empathetic role much</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">more delicious</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:28.559" style="s2">and i really have this capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">listen and mirror back</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.559" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s not as interesting to me to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">like state my</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:39.200" style="s2">claim but more to reflect and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">and i see this uh this change in people</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.200" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2">as they feel heard</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">like they&#39;re just enter a new space to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re more receptive and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">they have more of a vision of what it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">to embody</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">what they&#39;re feeling so um in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">speaking of messi i feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:55.520" style="s2">statement might even be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">messy but</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.520" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">so far the empathy circles where we</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">really hunkered out and mirror each</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:02.720" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:04.720" style="s2">has been the most fruitful you know</p>

<p begin="00:49:04.720" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m also really inspired by you too</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.720" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">and and to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:15.839" style="s2">say thank you daddy to peter oh my god</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">like these are the social terms that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:29.040" style="s2">were saying it&#39;s invisible that we need</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">to get rid of</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:10.079" style="s2">thanks um</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:13.680" style="s2">the question is on ideas about how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.079" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">harness the energy of social media</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.680" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">toward sense making and uh embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">and all of these things we like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">rather than strictly characterizing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">as the you know the dilemma of social</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">media</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:30.720" style="s2">how you can tap in to the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">people wanting to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">liking and all the kind of more shallow</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:37.359" style="s2">aspects of social media</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">uh toward you know something that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.359" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">believe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">beyond just the memes</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">does that question come across</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">you guys are muted by the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.839" end="00:50:54.960" style="s2">how to harness the power of social media</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.079" end="00:50:57.839" style="s2">in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.960" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">shallow yeah yeah or toward you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.839" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.559" style="s2">feel like you the change you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.839" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">um well this is something that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:16.160" style="s2">personally been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:19.520" style="s2">of for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.160" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.520" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">challenging but also i feel it has a</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.960" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">high impact um possibility the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">challenging part is that social media is</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:30.559" style="s2">not a neutral space</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">which is like plugging and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.559" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">fully with yourself like unlimited like</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:37.200" style="s2">is any social media any platform that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">you go</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.200" end="00:51:44.480" style="s2">has very strong um</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:45.359" style="s2">not just but a very strong architecture</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.480" end="00:51:47.920" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.359" end="00:51:48.960" style="s2">that likes it kind of directs the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.920" end="00:51:51.440" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.960" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">and directs your role in it towards a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.440" end="00:51:55.599" style="s2">certain place</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">and these places at least unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.599" end="00:51:58.240" style="s2">how everything is set up</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to be the best places and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.240" end="00:52:03.760" style="s2">places that feel like motion narrative</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s why i say challenging however</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.760" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not impossible and if this if this</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">is done properly</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">it has and it has the potential for</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">having enormous impact</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.720" end="00:52:20.319" style="s2">right now um at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">for what i&#39;ve i&#39;ve been yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.319" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">thinking of and investigating i feel</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">like memes and influencers</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">are the two are the two things that</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">have been tried on social media that</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">already work</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">um and that could have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">potential if done in our own way in like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">the meta-modern way</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">and going back to that i feel that also</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">what the best way to play with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">is to get something that is already</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">working so um</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">same meme format or if you&#39;re doing like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">influencer like say the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.520" style="s2">makeup tour how sore but like make it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.839" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">meta modern because that&#39;s how you link</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:52:59.599" style="s2">something from the previous imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.920" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">that&#39;s how you think something that</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.599" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">people have already an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">connection to and people already</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.160" end="00:53:04.720" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">with something new and that&#39;s how they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.720" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">can see the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">for me what at least it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:14.000" style="s2">necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">work so well um but this is all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.000" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">a matter of scale if you just do like</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">explainer videos</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:21.280" style="s2">or if you just do um like podcasts or</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:23.680" style="s2">interviews</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.280" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">this works so well for like a certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.680" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">audience</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">but for what what you need for like</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">broad culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">um change and like for broader scale</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">is a more subtle way of of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">doing that content but it would this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:40.720" style="s2">an area that definitely has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">potential and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.720" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">any agency that was exploring that with</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.200" style="s2">these like specific lands</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:49.040" style="s2">i think would be very promising and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.200" end="00:53:51.119" style="s2">something that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:52.319" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely like putting our focus</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.119" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">in right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.319" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">still trying to figure it out does that</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">yeah sure i look forward to seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">you guys figure out</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">yeah probably like ask us again in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">year yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">tyler had a really good thought um i was</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.240" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">hoping you could share it tyler uh it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">resonates a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">kind of what i&#39;m doing with the journals</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:14.640" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">sure can you all hear me okay</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">so much tarnelly really appreciated this</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">i was looking forward to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">i guess my comment was that in my brief</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:31.599" style="s2">experience in this space</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">i noticed that these hyper jargony sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.599" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">maker figureheads</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">tend to stray away from telling any sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">of personal stories or personal</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">histories</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">when they&#39;re broadcasting unless they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:46.240" style="s2">actually asked by some sort of moderator</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:48.799" style="s2">whereas the more accessible types and</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">female broadcasters tend to often lead</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.799" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">as you two did today actually um</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:57.280" style="s2">and i find personally that hearing</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:54:58.480" style="s2">people&#39;s personal stories and their</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.280" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">personal history</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.480" end="00:55:02.799" style="s2">as well as in the moment displays a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">vulnerability just immediately allows me</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.799" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">to connect and have a greater sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">trust in the space that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that i&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:11.599" style="s2">mainly through like the political</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">organizing space where</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.599" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">the work that i do around climate</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">justice the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">the strategies we use are really tied to</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.079" style="s2">telling stories as a way to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">folks</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.079" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">and so just kind of probing at how can</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">we create more spaces</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">for the folks on these sorts of calls to</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">be sharing stories as well as</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.000" style="s2">the people that we&#39;re trying to learn</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.000" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">so not really a question but just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">suggestion idea for us all to consider</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">the um the pointing out that we let</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">we led with that because yeah i mean it</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:48.559" style="s2">just came naturally to</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:51.839" style="s2">to introduce ourselves and i think</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.559" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">um when i think the reason why we did</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.839" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">that actually was because we felt</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:58.160" style="s2">like we weren&#39;t going to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.160" end="00:56:01.280" style="s2">so we just thought we have to just show</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.760" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">up with all of our cards and saying this</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.280" end="00:56:05.359" style="s2">is who we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:07.680" style="s2">and and you know we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.359" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">the kind of cultural capital in the in</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.680" end="00:56:10.480" style="s2">the sense-making scene that other people</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:13.599" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.480" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">um and and yeah and like you said you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.599" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">connected to it and so that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">actually at the beginning we were a bit</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">resistant of whether to do it or not to</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">do it because</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">it&#39;s true you said that most people</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:27.200" style="s2">don&#39;t do it and then it felt</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.240" style="s2">oh if we go and like talk about our</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.200" end="00:56:29.599" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.240" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">we will make it feel like everything is</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.599" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">about ourselves and we&#39;re trying to kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:34.559" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">capitalize on our like young you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.559" end="00:56:38.720" style="s2">like woman</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.079" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">thing and it will feel like an authentic</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.720" end="00:56:40.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">but then actually like the most</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">authentic thing is to just be yourself</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">and create a different space for you and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">like personally when i read interviews</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">and when i like listen to podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">i really want to know the story like i</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">not just the way of i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.200" end="00:57:02.400" style="s2">really beautiful because you get to like</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">see the person not just that&#39;s what they</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">but as a full human being with all their</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">complexity and like</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">all you know their queries and their</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">story behind um and that&#39;s like great</p>

<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">strategic</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.520" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">way we are humans that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">wired to love gossip like information</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">and information about people</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">is power and like that was especially</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">true you know back in our hunter</p>
