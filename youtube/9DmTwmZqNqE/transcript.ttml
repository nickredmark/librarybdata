<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">got interested in this area and what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.260" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">did before yeah so in 1993 I formed a IT</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:16.530" style="s2">services firm you know consulting firm</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">and I had operations in three states for</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.530" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">about ten years</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">you know Rhode Island Massachusetts and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">in Connecticut and then with the dot bum</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">crash in the UK thing all of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">materially changed and I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.479" style="s2">kind of pretty much on the beach around</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">2003 not wanting to go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.479" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">previous thing which was no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">happy hunting ground that it once was</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.020" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">and not knowing where I was what was</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">gonna happen next you know so for about</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:45.479" style="s2">three years</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">um I didn&#39;t know what I was doing and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.479" end="00:01:52.770" style="s2">then around 2005 2006 I started hearing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">this noise about about agility and scrum</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.770" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">you know and XP and started researching</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">that in 2005-2006 I went to a class</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:05.820" style="s2">about scrum and in that pretty much put</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:07.110" style="s2">me on the path I&#39;m on today yes since</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.820" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">then I&#39;ve been involved in coaching and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.110" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">training in that area the I first got</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:13.690" style="s2">exposed to the agile field in 2001 when</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:16.870" style="s2">I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.690" end="00:02:20.380" style="s2">to become chairman of a high-end chip</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.870" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">design software company in Ottawa and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.380" end="00:02:25.000" style="s2">was a amazing little company for recent</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:27.010" style="s2">college grads who had about two years of</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.000" end="00:02:29.860" style="s2">experience at northern telecom had some</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.010" end="00:02:32.440" style="s2">very clever ideas and we&#39;re on their way</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.860" end="00:02:34.570" style="s2">but they needed some organizational help</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.440" end="00:02:35.740" style="s2">a little bit of help on fundraising but</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.570" end="00:02:38.320" style="s2">one of the things they did have in which</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.740" end="00:02:41.380" style="s2">they believed in in a religious fashion</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.320" end="00:02:43.420" style="s2">was the use of scrum hmm and so I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.380" end="00:02:46.240" style="s2">okay I&#39;m just gonna watch here right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.420" end="00:02:48.310" style="s2">maybe I can give wise man advice when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.240" end="00:02:51.100" style="s2">see what a ridiculous thing this might</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.310" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">be right has been person who generally</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.100" end="00:02:55.390" style="s2">scoffed at management systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.430" style="s2">quote-unquote the truth of the manner</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.390" end="00:02:59.140" style="s2">the old guy this time just sat there and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.430" end="00:03:02.020" style="s2">didn&#39;t say anything just learned and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.140" end="00:03:03.700" style="s2">actually worked great and we did a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.020" end="00:03:05.410" style="s2">second company with some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.700" end="00:03:07.780" style="s2">cast of characters after we sold the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.410" end="00:03:10.090" style="s2">first very successfully and they did it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.780" end="00:03:12.220" style="s2">again then they used a slight variation</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.090" end="00:03:14.220" style="s2">on scrum which they essentially had</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.220" end="00:03:16.810" style="s2">learned from the first time around and</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.220" end="00:03:18.070" style="s2">what&#39;s the other one Kanban or some damn</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.810" end="00:03:19.239" style="s2">thing it&#39;s kind of like a hybrid between</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.070" end="00:03:21.010" style="s2">those two yes</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.239" end="00:03:22.360" style="s2">and again watched him do it I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.010" end="00:03:23.800" style="s2">have a word to say they clearly knew</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.360" end="00:03:27.250" style="s2">what they were doing so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.800" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">basically participating as involved with</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.250" end="00:03:35.560" style="s2">the use of since 2001 and then in 2013 a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:37.900" style="s2">little teeny micro startup that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.560" end="00:03:40.120" style="s2">oversaw for about six months we also</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.900" end="00:03:43.420" style="s2">used the variant on it so I was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.120" end="00:03:46.300" style="s2">impressed or the scope of a team of ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.420" end="00:03:48.280" style="s2">or less engineers I was convinced that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.300" end="00:03:50.260" style="s2">what it&#39;s for yep and I know but your</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.280" end="00:03:51.940" style="s2">ideas are that the concept and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.260" end="00:03:54.489" style="s2">philosophy could be used at greater</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.940" end="00:03:56.890" style="s2">scale is that fair to say if you have</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.489" end="00:03:59.140" style="s2">certain certain conditions in place yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.890" end="00:04:01.060" style="s2">you can scale it alright let&#39;s jump in</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.140" end="00:04:03.850" style="s2">here and talk about the first book I</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.060" end="00:04:05.709" style="s2">read in prep for this podcast as my</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.850" end="00:04:07.630" style="s2">listeners know I typically spend about</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.709" end="00:04:10.030" style="s2">ten hours getting prepped for each</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.630" end="00:04:12.910" style="s2">podcast and the first book is called</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.030" end="00:04:14.709" style="s2">open space agility Handbook of which Dan</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.910" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">is one of the co-authors but kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.709" end="00:04:18.310" style="s2">reading between the lines I&#39;d say it</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:18.910" style="s2">smelled like you were the main author is</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.310" end="00:04:21.430" style="s2">that fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.910" end="00:04:22.780" style="s2">that&#39;s fair I pretty much composed the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.430" end="00:04:25.330" style="s2">list of authors you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.780" end="00:04:26.669" style="s2">invited in to help with the book they</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.330" end="00:04:29.009" style="s2">substantially helped in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.669" end="00:04:30.419" style="s2">I put them all on the cover that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.009" end="00:04:32.819" style="s2">good thing yeah that&#39;s a good thing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.419" end="00:04:35.550" style="s2">essentially the basic framing is around</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.819" end="00:04:38.699" style="s2">I would describe it as agile open space</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.550" end="00:04:41.580" style="s2">technology could you just unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.699" end="00:04:44.729" style="s2">just a little bit yeah our natural way</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.580" end="00:04:46.590" style="s2">of working is to do what we&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.729" end="00:04:50.029" style="s2">doing and do what we&#39;re passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.590" end="00:04:53.189" style="s2">doing do stuff we have energy around so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.029" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">open space technology is you could think</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.189" end="00:04:59.250" style="s2">of it as a meeting format or an event</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">design that allows that kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.250" end="00:05:04.289" style="s2">self-organized behavior to just show up</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">in surface itself very very quickly the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.289" end="00:05:09.270" style="s2">normal rules of engagement are suspended</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">everyone&#39;s responsible for themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.270" end="00:05:14.069" style="s2">an open space meeting for their learning</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">for what they contribute for where they</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.069" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">go on what they do so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:20.400" style="s2">great time in open space you can blame</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:21.719" style="s2">yourself for that and if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.400" end="00:05:22.319" style="s2">terrible time you can also blame</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.719" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.319" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">so you know the natural self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:30.719" style="s2">world you know reveals itself in open</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:32.069" style="s2">space when people are in it and if</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.719" end="00:05:32.580" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever seen a picture of it you</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.069" end="00:05:34.949" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.580" end="00:05:36.629" style="s2">sometimes is up to you know seven</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.949" end="00:05:38.009" style="s2">hundred eight hundred people sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.629" end="00:05:40.469" style="s2">a circle and the beginning and end of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.009" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">the meeting it&#39;s quite an epic you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.469" end="00:05:45.990" style="s2">visual and then throughout the day folks</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.879" style="s2">are left to organize their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.990" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">attention and learning in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.879" end="00:05:51.740" style="s2">meaningful to them throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:54.659" style="s2">with the others and we use that for</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.740" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">organization level transformation now</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.659" end="00:05:59.639" style="s2">how do you staple that to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:01.500" style="s2">agile they seem to be again in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.639" end="00:06:04.219" style="s2">and in my experience limited that it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.500" end="00:06:06.479" style="s2">I think of agile as a technology</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.219" end="00:06:08.550" style="s2">appropriate for a team of not more than</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.479" end="00:06:11.699" style="s2">ten maybe on a really good day twelve</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.550" end="00:06:14.399" style="s2">engineers how does the concept of agile</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.699" end="00:06:16.740" style="s2">for a small team get stapled to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.399" end="00:06:18.509" style="s2">open space concept which sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.740" end="00:06:21.389" style="s2">could be up to hundreds of people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.509" end="00:06:23.460" style="s2">so I have a hypothesis about the agile</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.389" end="00:06:26.659" style="s2">stuff first a decent definition of agile</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.460" end="00:06:29.250" style="s2">is the ability to rapidly identify and</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.659" end="00:06:31.409" style="s2">respond to change and to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.250" end="00:06:34.589" style="s2">of our opportunities and that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.409" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">presented by that change the whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.589" end="00:06:39.689" style="s2">of this revolves around self-managed</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.370" end="00:06:41.429" style="s2">teams</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.689" end="00:06:43.469" style="s2">self-manage meaning they&#39;re managing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.429" end="00:06:46.499" style="s2">decisions that pertain to the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.469" end="00:06:49.409" style="s2">group so the self-management idea is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.499" end="00:06:53.159" style="s2">core to agility and I have a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.409" end="00:06:55.589" style="s2">about this which is most if not all of</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.159" end="00:06:59.369" style="s2">the improvement that you&#39;re getting from</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.589" end="00:07:02.819" style="s2">agility comes from this self-management</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.369" end="00:07:04.169" style="s2">behavior right so executive leaders</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.819" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">create the conditions where this can</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.169" end="00:07:09.329" style="s2">happen they get out of the way and allow</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.919" style="s2">people to do their thing and when folks</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.329" end="00:07:13.139" style="s2">start making decisions you know they</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.919" end="00:07:14.819" style="s2">engage and the engagement is associated</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.139" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">with just about every good thing and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.819" end="00:07:18.029" style="s2">then you see this great productivity</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:20.789" style="s2">improvement improvement and quality</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.029" end="00:07:23.969" style="s2">predictability reliability and so on so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.789" end="00:07:28.289" style="s2">on open space technology the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.969" end="00:07:30.719" style="s2">format without a lecture it demonstrates</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.289" end="00:07:32.849" style="s2">what this self-managed self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.719" end="00:07:36.719" style="s2">way of working actually looks like so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.849" end="00:07:40.349" style="s2">Harrison Owen composed open space in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.719" end="00:07:44.249" style="s2">80s the mid 80s and his work predated</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.349" end="00:07:46.709" style="s2">the agile manifesto by some 16 years so</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.249" end="00:07:48.479" style="s2">you know open space technology the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.709" end="00:07:50.159" style="s2">meeting format you know formulated by</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.479" end="00:07:54.679" style="s2">Harrison Owen or what he would say</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.159" end="00:07:57.809" style="s2">discovered by him is actually 100%</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.679" end="00:08:04.050" style="s2">aligned with agile ways of working in</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.809" end="00:08:05.429" style="s2">fact it totally embodies that so when</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.050" end="00:08:07.469" style="s2">you go into an organization you bring</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.429" end="00:08:09.689" style="s2">open space to an organization the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.469" end="00:08:11.999" style="s2">executives the workers the managers the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.689" end="00:08:14.579" style="s2">directors everybody they have a big Wow</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.999" end="00:08:16.229" style="s2">experience and what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.579" end="00:08:19.289" style="s2">experiencing is the power of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.229" end="00:08:20.909" style="s2">self-management so without a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.289" end="00:08:22.860" style="s2">we&#39;re demonstrating how good it can</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.909" end="00:08:25.469" style="s2">actually be how efficient it can be and</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.860" end="00:08:27.239" style="s2">we bring that in you know an agile way</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.469" end="00:08:29.639" style="s2">of working we use that as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.239" end="00:08:31.769" style="s2">frame for discussing how this thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.639" end="00:08:33.719" style="s2">really works so is it fair to say that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.769" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">the con time again trying to get the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.719" end="00:08:39.479" style="s2">concept clear here is that we have agile</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.419" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">as a set of philosophies and tools aimed</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.479" end="00:08:45.420" style="s2">at doing work at the team scale and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:47.009" style="s2">when you take those philosophies at</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.420" end="00:08:49.050" style="s2">least if not all the techniques and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.009" end="00:08:52.110" style="s2">marry them to the open space meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.050" end="00:08:53.520" style="s2">format you are then able to bring at</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.110" end="00:08:55.770" style="s2">least some or all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.520" end="00:08:57.840" style="s2">agile philosophy into larger scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.770" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">entities is that reasonable yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.840" end="00:09:01.500" style="s2">let me tell you a story right so most</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">organizations what they do is they do an</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:04.980" style="s2">agile type pilot so I might bring in</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">scrum and work with you know three or</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.980" end="00:09:09.810" style="s2">four teams and and get them moving and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">those are teams that want to actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.810" end="00:09:16.980" style="s2">work in that way when organizations do</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:19.890" style="s2">pilots with scrum gym they typically</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.980" end="00:09:23.250" style="s2">will look for willing teams to reduce</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.890" end="00:09:27.780" style="s2">the risk of failure right so willing</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.250" end="00:09:29.820" style="s2">teams committed authority figures the</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.780" end="00:09:31.590" style="s2">scrum framework you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.820" end="00:09:34.950" style="s2">winning combination so most of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.590" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2">pilots will go pretty good what happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.950" end="00:09:39.000" style="s2">is they get some really nice</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.740" end="00:09:41.010" style="s2">improvements and things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.000" end="00:09:42.890" style="s2">measuring and then they immediately want</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.010" end="00:09:45.240" style="s2">to scale it to a whole enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.890" end="00:09:47.070" style="s2">there&#39;s some problems with that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.240" end="00:09:49.230" style="s2">primary problem is the leaders get</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.070" end="00:09:51.390" style="s2">organizationally amnesia they forget</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.230" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">that the teams that were in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.390" end="00:09:57.690" style="s2">successful pilots were willing teams so</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:10:01.710" style="s2">we go from sort of an opt-in approach to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.690" end="00:10:03.960" style="s2">a mandated rolled out approach and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.710" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">know a lot of times that just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.960" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">work and and the reason why is because</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">good agile runs on engaged people and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:13.320" style="s2">engage people or people that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:15.150" style="s2">choosing you know in deciding choosing</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.320" end="00:10:16.920" style="s2">turns out to be very engaging so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.150" end="00:10:18.990" style="s2">this there&#39;s this whole relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.920" end="00:10:22.680" style="s2">between choosing something and being</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.990" end="00:10:25.020" style="s2">engaged and this is exactly the concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.680" end="00:10:28.470" style="s2">in open space and open space the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.020" end="00:10:30.810" style="s2">is optional to attend no one can make</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.470" end="00:10:34.710" style="s2">you you don&#39;t have to go to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.810" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">that is a requirement of open space so</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.710" end="00:10:39.650" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing with open space and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:43.860" style="s2">organizations Jim is we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.650" end="00:10:46.140" style="s2">gently introduce the idea of you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.860" end="00:10:47.910" style="s2">agile organizational change across the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.140" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">whole organization and we&#39;re engaging</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.910" end="00:10:52.230" style="s2">that organizations willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:55.080" style="s2">proceed you put all the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.230" end="00:10:56.700" style="s2">involved that are affected in a large</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.080" end="00:10:59.070" style="s2">all-hands open space meeting that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.700" end="00:11:01.230" style="s2">invitational you&#39;re gonna find out right</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.070" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">away about the organizational readiness</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.230" end="00:11:06.130" style="s2">and in willingness to to move forward a</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:08.560" style="s2">lot of these organizations</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.130" end="00:11:10.390" style="s2">they quote roll out you know scrum agile</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.560" end="00:11:12.550" style="s2">across their whole organization they</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.390" end="00:11:14.650" style="s2">might as well just put the money in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.550" end="00:11:16.390" style="s2">big pile and fluff it up and sprinkle a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.650" end="00:11:18.070" style="s2">little gas on it and flick a match on</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.390" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">that million dollars you know that would</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.070" end="00:11:22.540" style="s2">hurt a lot less people there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:26.260" style="s2">kind of infliction of organizational</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.540" end="00:11:27.940" style="s2">change today so open space rolls that</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:29.650" style="s2">back and says let&#39;s find out what people</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.940" end="00:11:31.690" style="s2">are willing to do and let&#39;s invite them</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.650" end="00:11:33.940" style="s2">into it and that&#39;s how that&#39;s how we do</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.690" end="00:11:37.390" style="s2">it with open space agility yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.940" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">that&#39;s very smart because again the you</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.390" end="00:11:40.720" style="s2">know the times I&#39;ve seen it a jewel work</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:43.630" style="s2">is when the people who are doing it are</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.720" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">committed it&#39;s actually from my days as</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.630" end="00:11:47.230" style="s2">a corporate technologist you know may or</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">may not know this back in the day I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.230" end="00:11:52.120" style="s2">responsible directly and indirectly for</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">5,000 technologists that today is</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.120" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">Thompson Reuters whoo and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2">day somewhat of the waterfall method</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">though at least in my tech groups which</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.300" end="00:12:02.290" style="s2">added up to about a thousand people we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:03.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t use anything quite so rigid as</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.290" end="00:12:06.850" style="s2">that but on the other hand we didn&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.850" end="00:12:09.850" style="s2">anything quite as disciplined as scrum</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.850" end="00:12:13.930" style="s2">and I would say that trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.850" end="00:12:17.110" style="s2">forced scrum at scale across 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.930" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">people strikes me as a daunting task at</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.110" end="00:12:21.850" style="s2">the minimum Jim this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.100" style="s2">happening routinely around the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.850" end="00:12:26.830" style="s2">today as we&#39;re speaking there are</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.100" end="00:12:28.570" style="s2">probably three four or five thousand</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.830" end="00:12:31.540" style="s2">implementations of exactly what you just</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.570" end="00:12:36.970" style="s2">described and the the reason is</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.540" end="00:12:39.130" style="s2">basically that you know executives they</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.970" end="00:12:42.940" style="s2">want an ABC story of how the change is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.130" end="00:12:46.120" style="s2">going to go meanwhile scrum is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.940" end="00:12:48.610" style="s2">empirical approach to process control</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.120" end="00:12:51.280" style="s2">right so in software being a high</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.610" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">complexity type of an endeavor scrum is</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.280" end="00:12:54.700" style="s2">perfect for that the reality is that</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:12:56.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do a little we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.700" end="00:12:58.360" style="s2">learn a little we&#39;re going to inspect</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.410" end="00:13:01.510" style="s2">that and we&#39;re gonna go again and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.360" end="00:13:04.630" style="s2">know that just doesn&#39;t land with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.510" end="00:13:08.440" style="s2">of authority figures who they want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.630" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">hear an ABC plan with an ABC budget so</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.440" end="00:13:12.580" style="s2">they really want it they want a</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:15.010" style="s2">waterfall approach to the implementation</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.580" end="00:13:16.930" style="s2">of an empirical approach</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.010" end="00:13:19.510" style="s2">and that gets sold all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.930" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">every single day yeah sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.510" end="00:13:25.959" style="s2">show ready to happen it&#39;s in progress</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:28.180" style="s2">Jim it&#39;s totally in progress even better</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.959" end="00:13:31.720" style="s2">I might be able to make a Saturday Night</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.180" end="00:13:34.060" style="s2">Live it&#39;s not quite fine so now oh I</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.720" end="00:13:36.010" style="s2">think I&#39;m getting a better sense of you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.060" end="00:13:38.139" style="s2">know the whole open space agility</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.010" end="00:13:39.790" style="s2">concept here so I&#39;m gonna try to restate</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.139" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">it again I tend to do this till I</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.790" end="00:13:45.010" style="s2">understand something very clearly which</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:47.110" style="s2">is your argument is that your open space</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.010" end="00:13:48.790" style="s2">meeting technology and things we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:51.339" style="s2">about later like your hundred days etc</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.790" end="00:13:53.769" style="s2">yeah yeah are a way to to get an</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.339" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">organization to appropriately adopt</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.769" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">agile techniques at appropriate scale</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:02.410" style="s2">that&#39;s right so one would not expect to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:04.690" style="s2">run a 3,000 person division from top to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.410" end="00:14:06.790" style="s2">bottom using scrum that just wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.690" end="00:14:10.449" style="s2">work but that the teams within that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.790" end="00:14:12.190" style="s2">3,000 person division from whom scrum or</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.449" end="00:14:14.680" style="s2">one of the other agile techniques was</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.190" end="00:14:16.060" style="s2">appropriate would seduce themselves into</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.680" end="00:14:18.510" style="s2">doing so when it was appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.060" end="00:14:20.949" style="s2">something like that well yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.510" end="00:14:22.420" style="s2">organizations have different functions</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.949" end="00:14:23.589" style="s2">and in different divisions and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.420" end="00:14:27.130" style="s2">departments so when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.589" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">products all of products can run on</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.130" end="00:14:32.290" style="s2">scrub at scale certain conditions have</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:34.209" style="s2">to be in place but it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.290" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">doable and you can you can create a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.209" end="00:14:37.319" style="s2">delivery machine and point it at</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:41.230" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.319" end="00:14:43.779" style="s2">using scrum for product the organization</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.230" end="00:14:46.029" style="s2">itself also you know has different</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.779" end="00:14:48.819" style="s2">functional areas like HR people ops</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.029" end="00:14:50.589" style="s2">legal and compliance and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.819" end="00:14:53.019" style="s2">you know that they&#39;re not going to adopt</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.589" end="00:14:55.560" style="s2">perfectly to a you know a scrum approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.019" end="00:14:59.620" style="s2">but the reality is on the product side</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.560" end="00:15:02.470" style="s2">scrum is it is a very good way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.620" end="00:15:04.510" style="s2">organize your engineering teams you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.470" end="00:15:06.459" style="s2">at scale so I&#39;m working right now with</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.510" end="00:15:09.670" style="s2">an organization that has nine hundred</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.459" end="00:15:11.889" style="s2">engineers globally and we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.670" end="00:15:13.420" style="s2">early steps of implementing scrum at</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.889" end="00:15:16.180" style="s2">scale and the first thing that I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.420" end="00:15:18.149" style="s2">with this leadership team with my my</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.180" end="00:15:21.430" style="s2">colleagues is we&#39;re taking them through</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.149" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">series of one-hour meetings it&#39;s a 13 14</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.430" end="00:15:25.899" style="s2">person leadership team and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.980" end="00:15:27.430" style="s2">confronting them with the reality of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.899" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">scrum guide you know the scrum guide</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.430" end="00:15:31.760" style="s2">says things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:36.350" style="s2">their abrupt in and in harsh the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.760" end="00:15:38.540" style="s2">primary thing that scrum does is it it</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.350" end="00:15:40.250" style="s2">has a set of rules about around decision</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.540" end="00:15:41.900" style="s2">rights around the three roll so for</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.250" end="00:15:44.390" style="s2">example for the product owner it says</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.900" end="00:15:46.490" style="s2">for the product owner to be successful</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.390" end="00:15:50.930" style="s2">everyone in the organization must</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.490" end="00:15:53.420" style="s2">respect his or her decisions so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.930" end="00:15:55.430" style="s2">we&#39;re walking through those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.420" end="00:15:57.770" style="s2">statements in the scrum guide and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.430" end="00:15:59.780" style="s2">asking the leadership team you know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.770" end="00:16:01.790" style="s2">do you think the level of agreement of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.780" end="00:16:04.520" style="s2">the organization over all right now is</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.790" end="00:16:06.410" style="s2">with this with the state you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.520" end="00:16:08.930" style="s2">doing scrum how well are you doing it</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.410" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">and rate it on one to ten where ten is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.930" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">great and one is really bad and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:16.100" style="s2">rate yourself what what&#39;s your level of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">willingness to support the statement as</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:20.990" style="s2">a leader to create the conditions where</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:24.230" style="s2">this statement can be true and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.990" end="00:16:26.630" style="s2">around the world organizations overall</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.230" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">do not go through this exercise they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.630" end="00:16:30.350" style="s2">just roll out scrum to unwilling teams</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:31.730" style="s2">they know what else the teams what they</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.350" end="00:16:35.180" style="s2">think or anything they just roll it out</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.730" end="00:16:37.580" style="s2">and a lot of times the CEO wants it or</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.180" end="00:16:39.890" style="s2">the CTO wants it you know but you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.580" end="00:16:41.300" style="s2">you were an executive for decades so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.890" end="00:16:42.590" style="s2">know that just because you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.300" end="00:16:44.660" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t mean that your team</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.590" end="00:16:45.710" style="s2">wants it your leadership team right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.660" end="00:16:47.840" style="s2">let me I have to tell you this story</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.710" end="00:16:50.570" style="s2">when I first became a CEO of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.840" end="00:16:52.640" style="s2">publicly-traded company I brought on one</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.570" end="00:16:56.270" style="s2">of my favorite strategy consultants and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.640" end="00:16:58.880" style="s2">he was cynical to the bone and would</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.270" end="00:17:01.340" style="s2">just tell you the way it was and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.880" end="00:17:03.800" style="s2">first day the first five minutes I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.340" end="00:17:05.450" style="s2">sitting on the imperial throne he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.800" end="00:17:07.160" style="s2">Jim you know all these buttons and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.450" end="00:17:07.580" style="s2">levers conceptually that are on your</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.160" end="00:17:09.320" style="s2">desk</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.580" end="00:17:11.270" style="s2">yeah ninety percent of them aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.320" end="00:17:12.860" style="s2">attached to anything you could pull the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.270" end="00:17:15.380" style="s2">levers and you can press the buttons but</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:17.330" style="s2">not a goddamn thing will happen exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.380" end="00:17:18.230" style="s2">you know what he was right and of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.330" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">you know that was a company where I</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.230" end="00:17:21.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t build it I built a goddamn it all</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:22.820" style="s2">those buttons would work but this is one</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.560" end="00:17:25.160" style="s2">of our I came in it was essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.820" end="00:17:27.530" style="s2">turnaround and he was absolutely right</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.160" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">most the was broken and so the job</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.530" end="00:17:33.440" style="s2">was the unfuck it basically over a</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:35.180" style="s2">period of time exactly exactly so you</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.440" end="00:17:36.050" style="s2">know if you&#39;re gonna do good agile you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.180" end="00:17:39.830" style="s2">know you have to create the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.050" end="00:17:41.430" style="s2">or the the space for people to do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.830" end="00:17:43.230" style="s2">kind of great work</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.430" end="00:17:45.150" style="s2">that space is created by authority</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.230" end="00:17:47.430" style="s2">figures they create the conditions they</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.150" end="00:17:49.050" style="s2">define the game so I work with the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.430" end="00:17:51.210" style="s2">leadership teams around you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.050" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">creating those conditions in I want a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.210" end="00:17:58.020" style="s2">very very strong unambiguous yes to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:17:59.490" style="s2">things that&#39;s that the scrum guide lays</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.020" end="00:18:01.530" style="s2">out around decision right so they</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.490" end="00:18:03.660" style="s2">understand the way decisions are made it</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.530" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">gonna change you know sometimes I kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.660" end="00:18:06.630" style="s2">of talk to fill them you know like</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">they&#39;ll give me objections to the scrum</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.630" end="00:18:10.200" style="s2">decision right so I don&#39;t like that rule</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:12.030" style="s2">about the product owner or whatever I</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.200" end="00:18:14.520" style="s2">don&#39;t say well hey let me ask you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.030" end="00:18:16.230" style="s2">question you make decisions today about</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.520" end="00:18:18.750" style="s2">product a certain way don&#39;t you they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.230" end="00:18:20.430" style="s2">like well yeah I&#39;m like well how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.750" end="00:18:23.460" style="s2">working for you and then we have that</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.430" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">conversation so they&#39;re admitting that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.460" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">the way they make decisions around</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.780" end="00:18:28.170" style="s2">product isn&#39;t working it&#39;s slowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:29.370" style="s2">things down and increase its decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.170" end="00:18:31.620" style="s2">latency and we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.370" end="00:18:34.290" style="s2">use scrum to reduce that decision</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.620" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">latency that&#39;s gonna require discipline</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.290" end="00:18:37.680" style="s2">and I really love the way you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">that around about scrum you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.680" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">scrum requires discipline and I just so</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:45.060" style="s2">enjoyed these said that earlier because</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:46.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what it takes yeah I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.060" end="00:18:49.080" style="s2">realized we jumped in to the deep end of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.950" end="00:18:51.390" style="s2">the pool could you take a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.080" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">minutes and describes how scrum works</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.390" end="00:18:54.900" style="s2">let&#39;s just use scrum because I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:56.760" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty close to a core standard</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.900" end="00:18:58.890" style="s2">flavor of agile yeah just give you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.760" end="00:19:01.020" style="s2">the roles and and and you know this or</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.890" end="00:19:06.030" style="s2">the basic how a eight-man team might use</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.020" end="00:19:09.330" style="s2">it sure yeah so scrum is a prefabricated</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.030" end="00:19:12.930" style="s2">plan for executing on work in three</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.330" end="00:19:15.930" style="s2">roles there&#39;s a product owner there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.930" end="00:19:17.820" style="s2">team and there&#39;s a scrum master the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.930" end="00:19:21.540" style="s2">product owner owns the product vision</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.820" end="00:19:23.910" style="s2">and maintains a list of things that need</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.540" end="00:19:27.000" style="s2">to be done and prioritizes that lists</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.910" end="00:19:30.120" style="s2">the team you know serves the product</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.000" end="00:19:33.030" style="s2">owners vision by looking at that list to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.120" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">that prioritized list in a highly</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.030" end="00:19:40.920" style="s2">structured planning meeting the team and</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:43.380" style="s2">only the team has the right to decide</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.920" end="00:19:47.220" style="s2">exactly how much of the topmost</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.380" end="00:19:50.070" style="s2">prioritized work they can fit into their</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.220" end="00:19:51.960" style="s2">time box at Sprint which is one week to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.070" end="00:19:53.969" style="s2">four weeks long</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.960" end="00:19:56.429" style="s2">some product owner presented to the team</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.969" end="00:19:57.749" style="s2">the team examines it as it stands they</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.429" end="00:20:00.029" style="s2">pull as much of the work as they</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.749" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">possibly can into the sprint they have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.029" end="00:20:03.659" style="s2">conversation about the release plan and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:05.429" style="s2">contingencies you know things might</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.659" end="00:20:07.229" style="s2">happen during the sprint and then they</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.429" end="00:20:10.679" style="s2">go off and they do the sprint and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.229" end="00:20:12.450" style="s2">rule is that none of that work can</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.679" end="00:20:14.279" style="s2">change it&#39;s froze and the team knows</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.450" end="00:20:15.649" style="s2">exactly what the scope of their work is</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.279" end="00:20:17.849" style="s2">and they know how much time they have</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.649" end="00:20:20.639" style="s2">they come out of that meeting knowing</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.849" end="00:20:23.909" style="s2">those two things and then each day</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.639" end="00:20:25.559" style="s2">they&#39;re required to depict their</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.909" end="00:20:27.330" style="s2">progress and some kind of visual</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.559" end="00:20:30.299" style="s2">artifact that anyone in the organization</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.330" end="00:20:32.700" style="s2">can look at so it&#39;s put somewhere on</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.299" end="00:20:35.159" style="s2">public display or you know somewhere on</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.700" end="00:20:37.080" style="s2">a shared Drive or something Jim where</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.159" end="00:20:38.969" style="s2">anybody at any time can see the work</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.080" end="00:20:40.679" style="s2">remaining yeah but in a small company</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.969" end="00:20:43.019" style="s2">like the ones where I&#39;ve used it we</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.679" end="00:20:46.049" style="s2">actually used yellow sticky pads on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.019" end="00:20:48.269" style="s2">wall there you go so anyone at any time</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.049" end="00:20:50.279" style="s2">knows exactly where the team stands and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.269" end="00:20:53.119" style="s2">then each day the team has their own</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.279" end="00:20:56.070" style="s2">private daily scrum a stand up meeting</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.119" end="00:20:58.589" style="s2">which is a kind of status meeting now</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.070" end="00:21:01.070" style="s2">interestingly in the status meeting the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.589" end="00:21:06.210" style="s2">authority that they report to is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.070" end="00:21:08.039" style="s2">themselves so each team member basically</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.210" end="00:21:09.690" style="s2">reports on what&#39;s going on with their</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.039" end="00:21:12.839" style="s2">work today and yesterday and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.690" end="00:21:14.700" style="s2">obstacles they&#39;re facing out of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.839" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">meeting comes a list of impediment</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.700" end="00:21:20.249" style="s2">things that are holding the team back</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:22.919" style="s2">and there&#39;s a facilitator role called</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.249" end="00:21:26.519" style="s2">the scrum master whose job is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.919" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">basically help the team be great so as</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.519" end="00:21:30.059" style="s2">impediments are surfaced during the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:31.619" style="s2">daily scrum and through cut through</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.059" end="00:21:33.960" style="s2">conversation throughout the work the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.619" end="00:21:37.019" style="s2">scrum master takes care of removing</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.960" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">those impediments and the scrum master</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.019" end="00:21:41.460" style="s2">is duly authorized to do so so if</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:45.239" style="s2">necessary you know the scrum master has</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.460" end="00:21:46.830" style="s2">is authorized to go to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.239" end="00:21:49.559" style="s2">highest executives in the company and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.830" end="00:21:52.409" style="s2">straighten things out so this team can</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.559" end="00:21:54.269" style="s2">get their work done yeah and and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.409" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">when the sprint ends there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.269" end="00:21:58.259" style="s2">demonstration of the work stakeholders</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:21:59.759" style="s2">are invited to that demonstration the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.259" end="00:22:01.679" style="s2">product owner is there it&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.759" end="00:22:03.330" style="s2">meeting the team is there they</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.679" end="00:22:05.820" style="s2">demonstrate the functionality in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.330" end="00:22:08.790" style="s2">goal and scrum that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.820" end="00:22:11.100" style="s2">scrum done extremely well provides for</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.790" end="00:22:13.110" style="s2">the possibility of shipping something at</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.100" end="00:22:14.910" style="s2">the end of the Sprint so a potentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.110" end="00:22:18.120" style="s2">shippable increment or product is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:21.060" style="s2">produced by the team which implies a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.120" end="00:22:24.060" style="s2">right because there has to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.060" end="00:22:26.760" style="s2">testing it has to be production ready</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.060" end="00:22:28.290" style="s2">you know all of these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.760" end="00:22:30.090" style="s2">have to be in place so most</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.290" end="00:22:31.620" style="s2">organizations aren&#39;t there but we move</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.090" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">in the direction of improvement every</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.620" end="00:22:35.940" style="s2">single sprint and then you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.130" style="s2">end of a sprint we have a retrospective</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.940" end="00:22:40.920" style="s2">meaning we look back on what we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.130" end="00:22:45.270" style="s2">experienced and get some learning from</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.920" end="00:22:47.220" style="s2">that and form some new experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.270" end="00:22:49.890" style="s2">we want to try in the next sprint to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.220" end="00:22:52.230" style="s2">improve a little more and then we repeat</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.890" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">the cycle and and that&#39;s that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.230" end="00:22:56.490" style="s2">scrum works and the team size is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">team size is never less than three</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.490" end="00:23:01.380" style="s2">people are more than nine or ten but in</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:02.700" style="s2">that range yeah very interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.380" end="00:23:04.380" style="s2">you did a good job laying that Adam a</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.700" end="00:23:05.490" style="s2">few comments I wanted to make just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.380" end="00:23:08.040" style="s2">think I&#39;ll start at the bottom and work</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.490" end="00:23:09.990" style="s2">my way up sure which is you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.040" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">the in theory you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.990" end="00:23:14.640" style="s2">ship something at the end of each sprint</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:16.410" style="s2">you know I to Matt down a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.640" end="00:23:18.030" style="s2">I say you have to have a deliverable</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.410" end="00:23:19.830" style="s2">that actually runs at the end of each</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.030" end="00:23:21.630" style="s2">spread you know a deliverable meaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.830" end="00:23:24.150" style="s2">and internal deliverable that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.630" end="00:23:25.790" style="s2">runs which then implies that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.150" end="00:23:28.350" style="s2">you have to have a discipline of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.790" end="00:23:30.300" style="s2">incremental builds all the time right</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.350" end="00:23:32.340" style="s2">none of it none of those build it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.300" end="00:23:34.200" style="s2">then or then right right right then test</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.340" end="00:23:36.990" style="s2">and then hope it all passes a test wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.200" end="00:23:39.030" style="s2">so you have to compile every night at</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.990" end="00:23:40.680" style="s2">the worst and in this day and age you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.030" end="00:23:42.960" style="s2">might as well do it continuously and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.680" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">which means that you have to invest and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.960" end="00:23:46.620" style="s2">this is something that if you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.150" style="s2">this you probably shouldn&#39;t do scrum in</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.620" end="00:23:49.650" style="s2">a big corporate environment which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.150" end="00:23:51.990" style="s2">that you need to invest in something</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.650" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">that&#39;s called DevOps which is a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.990" end="00:23:56.190" style="s2">career and if you&#39;re a person looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.980" style="s2">for a job that will pay well for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.190" end="00:24:00.450" style="s2">long while DevOps is one which is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.980" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">is the operational infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.450" end="00:24:05.790" style="s2">necessary to be able to do continuous</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:07.650" style="s2">builds and continuous deployments</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.790" end="00:24:09.570" style="s2">without having to be touched by human</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.650" end="00:24:12.360" style="s2">ants and there&#39;s all these really neat</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.570" end="00:24:14.640" style="s2">tools these days that do just that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.360" end="00:24:16.310" style="s2">then the final part I would put my</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.640" end="00:24:18.150" style="s2">flavour on it you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.310" end="00:24:19.020" style="s2">deliverables at the end of each sprint</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.150" end="00:24:21.540" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.020" end="00:24:23.220" style="s2">incremental builds and DevOps it makes a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.540" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">lot of sense to do what&#39;s called test</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.220" end="00:24:27.510" style="s2">oriented development which is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:29.610" style="s2">literally write the tests first for</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.510" end="00:24:31.110" style="s2">every little tiny bit of code down at</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.610" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">the that&#39;s right now at the function</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.110" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">level so that when you when you push the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">code to the server and the DevOps magic</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2">occurs and it&#39;s all built all those</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:42.210" style="s2">tests are run and if they don&#39;t pass you</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:45.480" style="s2">get a yellow flag back to you by email</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.210" end="00:24:47.100" style="s2">or slack or something within a minute or</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.480" end="00:24:48.360" style="s2">two of the time you checked your code in</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.100" end="00:24:50.670" style="s2">and you might check in at two o&#39;clock in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.360" end="00:24:53.790" style="s2">the afternoon at 2:05 you get a message</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.670" end="00:24:56.040" style="s2">on slacks as oops your code failed the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.790" end="00:24:57.870" style="s2">following three tests and that means</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.040" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">that you ready you got to work on it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.870" end="00:25:00.930" style="s2">that certainly by the end of the Sprint</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:02.790" style="s2">and probably better that by the end of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.930" end="00:25:04.800" style="s2">the day you fixed those problem I love</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.790" end="00:25:07.350" style="s2">that I&#39;m glad you&#39;re bringing up DevOps</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.800" end="00:25:09.210" style="s2">you know like when a Cub programmer goes</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.350" end="00:25:11.460" style="s2">to work for Facebook or Amazon the first</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.210" end="00:25:13.140" style="s2">thing that they do with them is they</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.460" end="00:25:16.260" style="s2">have them push some code to production</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.140" end="00:25:18.870" style="s2">the very first day so you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.260" end="00:25:21.590" style="s2">DevOps is a kind of radicalized agile</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.870" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">right so what happens is all of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.590" end="00:25:26.370" style="s2">repetitive tasks that no developers want</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:28.710" style="s2">to do anyway it&#39;s being relegated to</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.370" end="00:25:33.350" style="s2">robots you know programs and computers</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.710" end="00:25:37.170" style="s2">and what&#39;s what&#39;s happening there is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.350" end="00:25:40.050" style="s2">authority to make decisions is is being</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.170" end="00:25:41.790" style="s2">democratized Jim previously like in</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.050" end="00:25:43.860" style="s2">these big firms like insurance companies</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.790" end="00:25:45.990" style="s2">brokerage firms banks government</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.860" end="00:25:48.300" style="s2">agencies they have their Quality</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.990" end="00:25:51.900" style="s2">Assurance department which is an entire</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.300" end="00:25:53.550" style="s2">you know an entire thing with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.900" end="00:25:55.590" style="s2">head and a budget and hire fire</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.550" end="00:25:57.690" style="s2">authority and all the stuff in the new</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.590" end="00:26:00.570" style="s2">world the devil ops radicalized agile</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.690" end="00:26:02.340" style="s2">the cub programmer now is authorized to</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.570" end="00:26:05.430" style="s2">push things to production there are no</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.340" end="00:26:09.600" style="s2">gatekeepers if it passes through those</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.430" end="00:26:13.380" style="s2">tests like you say there is a 99.99999</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.600" end="00:26:16.110" style="s2">99% chance that all the code is good so</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.380" end="00:26:18.710" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is a total revolution</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.110" end="00:26:20.970" style="s2">Wow I wouldn&#39;t go I wouldn&#39;t go that far</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.710" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">you know truthfully code coverage is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.970" end="00:26:26.820" style="s2">never that good not a 9.99 it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:28.170" style="s2">98 or 99 so you can still have</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.820" end="00:26:29.940" style="s2">which is why if you&#39;re gonna push it up</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.170" end="00:26:31.710" style="s2">to production you have to have a way to</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.940" end="00:26:32.410" style="s2">revert real fast and that&#39;s again part</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.710" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">of Deb</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.410" end="00:26:36.670" style="s2">ray-ray right so Amazon your Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:38.950" style="s2">they pushed off the production four</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.670" end="00:26:40.630" style="s2">hundred five hundred times a day I may</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.950" end="00:26:44.050" style="s2">probably pull it back go ahead you were</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.630" end="00:26:45.870" style="s2">three times right right so what this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.050" end="00:26:50.350" style="s2">doing Jim is it&#39;s upsetting everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.870" end="00:26:52.810" style="s2">everyone&#39;s upset why because people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.350" end="00:26:55.480" style="s2">made decisions yesterday do not make</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.810" end="00:26:57.280" style="s2">them today the QA people used to make</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.480" end="00:27:00.670" style="s2">decisions yesterday now the cub</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.280" end="00:27:02.380" style="s2">developers make those decisions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.670" end="00:27:04.030" style="s2">upsetting to people so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.380" end="00:27:05.680" style="s2">whole revolution in decision rights</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.030" end="00:27:08.490" style="s2">that&#39;s going on that&#39;s being driven by</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.680" end="00:27:10.720" style="s2">this agility stuff in develops is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.490" end="00:27:12.790" style="s2">radicalized form of that I&#39;m so glad you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.720" end="00:27:14.620" style="s2">brought it up because it&#39;s so show so</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.790" end="00:27:16.810" style="s2">what&#39;s happening that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.620" end="00:27:19.660" style="s2">revolution in decision rights in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.810" end="00:27:20.950" style="s2">software development it&#39;s just amazing</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.660" end="00:27:23.170" style="s2">we have I was doing a readiness</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.950" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">assessment for something like your open</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.170" end="00:27:26.530" style="s2">space agility one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:28.570" style="s2">absolutely make sure if I said the word</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.530" end="00:27:30.430" style="s2">DevOps and a senior executive looked at</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.570" end="00:27:32.950" style="s2">me cross-eyed I&#39;d say maybe I better</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.430" end="00:27:34.510" style="s2">come back next year because DevOps would</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.950" end="00:27:36.850" style="s2">seem to be central to make this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.510" end="00:27:38.670" style="s2">stuff work particularly at scale oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.850" end="00:27:42.820" style="s2">but you understand no I mean any</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.670" end="00:27:45.910" style="s2">organization can spend 100 maybe 150 200</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.820" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">thousand bucks and set this up okay but</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.910" end="00:27:50.380" style="s2">the resistance is in the entrenched</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:52.660" style="s2">bureaucracy of QA and some of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.380" end="00:27:55.570" style="s2">other departments that don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.660" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">evolve they like things the way they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.570" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">and don&#39;t want to lose their head count</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:28:00.700" style="s2">right yeah they have their jobs they</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:02.050" style="s2">don&#39;t want to lose their jobs goddamnit</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.700" end="00:28:06.310" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to break the iron rice</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.050" end="00:28:07.530" style="s2">bowl exactly that&#39;s what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.310" end="00:28:11.170" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.530" end="00:28:13.030" style="s2">your horses they wrote in on write their</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.170" end="00:28:19.180" style="s2">horses right and then you barbecue the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.030" end="00:28:21.550" style="s2">horse good alright that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.180" end="00:28:23.890" style="s2">good you know just critical stuff I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.550" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">gonna pop up to my favorite hobby horse</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.890" end="00:28:28.030" style="s2">and you know people that work with me</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:30.190" style="s2">know that if I actually had to do a real</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.030" end="00:28:32.350" style="s2">job sometime which I sure sure I</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.190" end="00:28:34.210" style="s2">hope I never have to do it would be as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.350" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">product manager I don&#39;t even though I</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.210" end="00:28:37.950" style="s2">don&#39;t think I ever had that title the</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.950" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s what I always was right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.950" end="00:28:44.650" style="s2">the biggest value I believe I added into</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:46.060" style="s2">corporate America in say the 1990s was</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.650" end="00:28:48.400" style="s2">introducing ruts</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.060" end="00:28:50.740" style="s2">eyal product management okay and also</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.400" end="00:28:53.170" style="s2">into the startups and you know the key</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.740" end="00:28:55.660" style="s2">part was the product manager had to be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.170" end="00:28:57.970" style="s2">really senior job and frankly should</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.660" end="00:29:00.190" style="s2">report to the CEO and if you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.970" end="00:29:02.980" style="s2">that caused all kinds of storms in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.190" end="00:29:06.310" style="s2">the same way DevOps does woohoo but when</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.980" end="00:29:09.130" style="s2">I then learned about agile in 2001 and</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.310" end="00:29:11.260" style="s2">they made you know this focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.130" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">product owner I said oh I love this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.260" end="00:29:16.690" style="s2">is like a miniature version of Rutt</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.720" end="00:29:19.480" style="s2">product management and you highlighted</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.690" end="00:29:21.730" style="s2">the part that is absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.480" end="00:29:24.130" style="s2">but usually doesn&#39;t happen in which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.730" end="00:29:26.920" style="s2">the product owner has to be strong</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.130" end="00:29:28.540" style="s2">enough to have credibility up and down</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.920" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">the chain yes and if you turn the</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.540" end="00:29:33.040" style="s2">product owner into some you know 22 year</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:34.750" style="s2">old person fresh out of college with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.040" end="00:29:36.310" style="s2">clipboard that they got a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.750" end="00:29:38.170" style="s2">function points from the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.310" end="00:29:40.510" style="s2">department you know it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.170" end="00:29:42.760" style="s2">show oh yeah the product owner has to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.510" end="00:29:45.430" style="s2">able to put themself in the place of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.760" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">customer absolutely and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.430" end="00:29:48.940" style="s2">really to really know the business and</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:50.920" style="s2">they have to have more than a clue about</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.940" end="00:29:53.230" style="s2">the technology and they have to have the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.920" end="00:29:55.600" style="s2">respect of of everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.230" end="00:29:57.820" style="s2">organization and and this is a rare</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.600" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">person that someone who relishes</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.820" end="00:30:02.740" style="s2">Authority and has the goods now are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.080" style="s2">seeing that out in your practice and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.740" end="00:30:06.550" style="s2">world that people are willing to or</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.080" end="00:30:09.490" style="s2">confined whether they&#39;re willing or not</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.550" end="00:30:12.550" style="s2">but that really good product owners are</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.490" end="00:30:15.130" style="s2">appearing when needed you know my whole</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.550" end="00:30:17.740" style="s2">approach to this around the rules is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.130" end="00:30:19.800" style="s2">that in an organization the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.740" end="00:30:22.180" style="s2">to possibly do is describe the role</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.800" end="00:30:24.640" style="s2">identify people who might be able to fit</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.180" end="00:30:27.490" style="s2">the role get them all in one room and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.640" end="00:30:30.640" style="s2">invite them to come in and occupy the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:32.710" style="s2">role and instead of assigning it this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.640" end="00:30:34.660" style="s2">this will this will create the best</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.710" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">possible product manager so you can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.660" end="00:30:37.810" style="s2">you you you Whittle it down to the you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:40.750" style="s2">know the people in your organization</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.810" end="00:30:42.430" style="s2">that you think meet the criteria you get</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.750" end="00:30:45.970" style="s2">them in one room explain the gravity of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.430" end="00:30:48.100" style="s2">the situation and allow them to opt in</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.970" end="00:30:49.750" style="s2">this is the fastest way to get a good</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.100" end="00:30:51.190" style="s2">product knowing that I know of I like</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.750" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">that that&#39;s great because it&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.190" end="00:30:56.040" style="s2">without it ain&#39;t gonna work didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">in fact my mentor the very first</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.040" end="00:30:59.960" style="s2">PowerPoint I ever did on rut style</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.060" style="s2">product management</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.960" end="00:31:04.490" style="s2">showed the product manager as the Greek</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.060" end="00:31:06.620" style="s2">god Janus with you know the face that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.490" end="00:31:09.200" style="s2">faced in future actually I said it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.620" end="00:31:11.270" style="s2">to look to the technology what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.200" end="00:31:13.550" style="s2">possible and to the market what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.270" end="00:31:15.620" style="s2">in fact I then eventually it took me</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.550" end="00:31:17.060" style="s2">about a year I cooked product management</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.620" end="00:31:18.620" style="s2">this was not quite the same as being a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.060" end="00:31:20.900" style="s2">product owner but it&#39;s very close yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.620" end="00:31:23.060" style="s2">down to one sentence do you want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.900" end="00:31:26.270" style="s2">the rutti in one sentence on product</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.060" end="00:31:29.660" style="s2">management sure it is the optimal</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.270" end="00:31:32.540" style="s2">trade-off between the doable and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.660" end="00:31:35.660" style="s2">desirable yeah and that raises a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:37.490" style="s2">issue of value right exactly someone has</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.660" end="00:31:39.980" style="s2">to know what is desirable but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.490" end="00:31:42.920" style="s2">what being the target for the customer</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">is all about yeah in value value has</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.920" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">many dimensions and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:49.520" style="s2">that is hotly discussed during product</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">development you know and that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.520" end="00:31:52.970" style="s2">prioritize things but the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:55.370" style="s2">you got to have one person make the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.970" end="00:31:59.000" style="s2">calls my view Jeff Sutherland refers to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.370" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">it as the single ringabel neck you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.000" end="00:32:04.430" style="s2">and now I hope you&#39;ll interview him on</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:06.590" style="s2">your show Jeff Sutherland is the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.430" end="00:32:10.520" style="s2">co-creator of scrum he&#39;s a West Point</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.590" end="00:32:13.790" style="s2">grad after that he graduated top in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.520" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">top gun fighter pilot program he flew</p>

<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">rate was 50% people who had that job he</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.950" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">was in the Air Force for 11 years then</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:32.150" style="s2">when that stuff and other things and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:34.850" style="s2">then after that he went on and got some</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.150" end="00:32:36.950" style="s2">got a PhD in statistics from Stanford</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.850" end="00:32:38.740" style="s2">and he had he did cancer research as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.950" end="00:32:41.210" style="s2">professor at the University of Colorado</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.740" end="00:32:43.990" style="s2">and he really got into complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.210" end="00:32:46.940" style="s2">systems when he started studying biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.990" end="00:32:49.370" style="s2">hels belles ii no more do you know this</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.940" end="00:32:51.740" style="s2">guy hook us up yeah it definitely hook</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.370" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">you up yeah yeah guy who flies phantoms</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.740" end="00:32:56.330" style="s2">above treetops I have some personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:32:58.430" style="s2">history on that and isn&#39;t the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.330" end="00:33:01.000" style="s2">hell yes and invented scrum god damn</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.430" end="00:33:03.170" style="s2">right we&#39;ll have him on the gym Roger</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.000" end="00:33:06.440" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you he&#39;s got he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.170" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">something to say and he made this rule</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.440" end="00:33:10.460" style="s2">about the product owner having</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:12.500" style="s2">command authority over the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.460" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">prioritization in the backlog and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.500" end="00:33:17.420" style="s2">always one person not a committee and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:20.780" style="s2">this is how you just you know reduce</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.420" end="00:33:22.640" style="s2">reduce complexity really really fast you</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.780" end="00:33:24.380" style="s2">know the developers can go to one person</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.640" end="00:33:26.360" style="s2">to get an answer there&#39;s no ambiguity</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.380" end="00:33:28.490" style="s2">about it there&#39;s a lot of decisiveness</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.360" end="00:33:30.680" style="s2">that decision latency is really really</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.490" end="00:33:32.450" style="s2">low you know the quality of what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.680" end="00:33:36.440" style="s2">produced is very high if you have a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.450" end="00:33:39.950" style="s2">competent product or and yeah Jeff Jeff</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.440" end="00:33:43.580" style="s2">composed scrum in the nineteen nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.950" end="00:33:45.380" style="s2">ninety started in 1993 I actually was</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.580" end="00:33:47.300" style="s2">teaching at that time I was teaching</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.380" end="00:33:48.980" style="s2">Microsoft platforms and tools I was</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.300" end="00:33:51.500" style="s2">working at the company called idx in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.980" end="00:33:54.410" style="s2">Boston the later got purchased by GE GE</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.500" end="00:33:56.570" style="s2">Healthcare and I was here in these</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.410" end="00:33:59.300" style="s2">noises from from some people some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.570" end="00:34:02.090" style="s2">developers in my classes about this this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.300" end="00:34:04.040" style="s2">guy Sutherland the new CTO and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.090" end="00:34:05.720" style="s2">this thing scrum and we have this daily</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.040" end="00:34:07.160" style="s2">stand-up meeting we have the ends of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.720" end="00:34:09.110" style="s2">these questions and all those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.160" end="00:34:11.030" style="s2">stuff what was actually happening was</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.110" end="00:34:12.860" style="s2">the genesis of scrum right under my nose</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.030" end="00:34:15.860" style="s2">but I was too busy they&#39;d really even</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.860" end="00:34:19.550" style="s2">notice in those days in 1993 Jeff</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.860" end="00:34:23.060" style="s2">created a system where when the work is</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.550" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">at the edge of chaos you can bring it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.060" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">down from Kate you know the edge of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:30.290" style="s2">chaos to you know complex and from</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:32.390" style="s2">complex to complicated and wrap your</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.290" end="00:34:34.040" style="s2">hands around it and increase the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.390" end="00:34:36.230" style="s2">predictability and reliability of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.040" end="00:34:39.050" style="s2">software development you know as you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.230" end="00:34:41.090" style="s2">know software development you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.050" end="00:34:43.220" style="s2">predictions in the beginning are just</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.090" end="00:34:45.860" style="s2">wild ass guesses Jim write this like two</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.220" end="00:34:49.640" style="s2">standard deviations you know or very</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.860" end="00:34:51.290" style="s2">variance in in in in the range of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.640" end="00:34:55.370" style="s2">could possibly happen right so through</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.290" end="00:34:57.410" style="s2">experience we we narrow that cone of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.370" end="00:34:59.090" style="s2">uncertainty you know through getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.410" end="00:35:00.320" style="s2">direct experience you know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.090" end="00:35:03.230" style="s2">a couple isn&#39;t available they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.320" end="00:35:04.970" style="s2">interesting the first one is just going</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.230" end="00:35:07.310" style="s2">and doing something is superior to</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.970" end="00:35:09.260" style="s2">talking about it right that&#39;s number one</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.310" end="00:35:11.450" style="s2">absolutely get direct experience</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.260" end="00:35:12.650" style="s2">inspecting spirits right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.450" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">second lesson that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.650" end="00:35:17.690" style="s2">is the quality of software turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:19.340" style="s2">be a function of the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.690" end="00:35:21.410" style="s2">interactions</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.340" end="00:35:25.730" style="s2">in communications buy-in between the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.410" end="00:35:27.010" style="s2">team members so scrum encourages very</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.730" end="00:35:30.080" style="s2">very high quality</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.010" end="00:35:31.880" style="s2">interactions through the daily scrum the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.080" end="00:35:33.710" style="s2">Sprint planning sprint review you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.880" end="00:35:35.750" style="s2">this there&#39;s a real efficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.710" end="00:35:38.540" style="s2">communication there that that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.750" end="00:35:40.520" style="s2">beautiful and it&#39;s it can create</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.540" end="00:35:42.980" style="s2">something really great yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.520" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">and we discovered in the 80s something</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.980" end="00:35:47.630" style="s2">that was I would say conceptually a</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:50.750" style="s2">precursor which again back in the early</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.630" end="00:35:52.730" style="s2">70s and early 80s people would have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.750" end="00:35:54.470" style="s2">various sub parts of the team&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.730" end="00:35:57.290" style="s2">on their modules and they wouldn&#39;t bring</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.470" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">them together until ridiculously late in</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.290" end="00:36:01.940" style="s2">the process that&#39;s always a bad idea at</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:03.860" style="s2">least in my companies one of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.940" end="00:36:06.560" style="s2">innovations was the earliest possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.860" end="00:36:09.110" style="s2">end-to-end system right we could have</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.560" end="00:36:10.970" style="s2">fairly minimal functionality but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.110" end="00:36:12.170" style="s2">goddamn thing had to work from one end</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.970" end="00:36:13.910" style="s2">to the other and most of the businesses</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.170" end="00:36:16.580" style="s2">I was involved in was building online</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.910" end="00:36:18.440" style="s2">information systems that work at a at</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.580" end="00:36:20.450" style="s2">least the continental scale sometimes a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.440" end="00:36:22.640" style="s2">worldwide scale there was an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.450" end="00:36:24.860" style="s2">of involved to make it end-to-end</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.640" end="00:36:26.270" style="s2">actually work but I&#39;d get into end to</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.860" end="00:36:29.060" style="s2">work you know about three or four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.270" end="00:36:30.740" style="s2">into a year-long project and people said</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.060" end="00:36:32.870" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible I don&#39;t know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.740" end="00:36:35.570" style="s2">we just put wherever we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.870" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">right and we will have information</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.570" end="00:36:40.190" style="s2">flowing from end to end and back again</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">in three or four weeks and then we will</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.190" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">work from there and that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:47.300" style="s2">again conceptually similar though not as</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:48.950" style="s2">fully robustly grown out as you know the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.300" end="00:36:50.810" style="s2">scrub approach and its incremental</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.950" end="00:36:53.750" style="s2">builds and the damn thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.810" end="00:36:55.310" style="s2">actually works every day yeah yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.750" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so great to be talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.310" end="00:36:59.540" style="s2">software guy about a software</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:02.180" style="s2">development process right this whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.540" end="00:37:05.720" style="s2">this whole thing with with with that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.180" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">know agile scrum organizational scaling</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.720" end="00:37:10.760" style="s2">of scrum and so forth points to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.760" end="00:37:15.190" style="s2">interactions the communication that</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">determines the quality of the product so</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.190" end="00:37:21.710" style="s2">actually the more discipline we are in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:23.870" style="s2">communicating the better the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.710" end="00:37:26.510" style="s2">the product that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.870" end="00:37:28.490" style="s2">lesson of scrum scrum as it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.510" end="00:37:30.260" style="s2">be and has been tuned to be a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.490" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">good approach and you do make the point</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.260" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">in your book and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:34.580" style="s2">important to throw out here they even</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:36.680" style="s2">though you know my experience has all</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.580" end="00:37:39.350" style="s2">been scrum one case was a homemade</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.680" end="00:37:42.110" style="s2">variant of scrum but there are several</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.350" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">other disciplines of agile out there and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.110" end="00:37:46.760" style="s2">your books are quite clear that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:48.980" style="s2">should not prescribe one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.760" end="00:37:51.620" style="s2">that is I&#39;ve read them that teams should</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.980" end="00:37:53.060" style="s2">choose which one of the agile approaches</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.620" end="00:37:55.370" style="s2">that they want to use yeah your</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.060" end="00:37:57.170" style="s2">listeners they want to really do some</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.370" end="00:38:00.620" style="s2">research on this they can go in in</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.170" end="00:38:03.350" style="s2">Google the agile in position or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.620" end="00:38:06.800" style="s2">agile in position revisit it where</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.350" end="00:38:08.450" style="s2">you&#39;ll read essays about how processes</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.800" end="00:38:12.460" style="s2">or you know so-called agile processes</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.450" end="00:38:14.750" style="s2">are being imposed on teams meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.460" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">self-management is where all of the all</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.750" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">of the goodness comes from and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:20.120" style="s2">killing it with the prescription right</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:21.830" style="s2">you&#39;re prescribing something to the team</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.120" end="00:38:24.620" style="s2">and not self managing anything at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.830" end="00:38:26.630" style="s2">because you&#39;re not deciding anything so</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.620" end="00:38:29.570" style="s2">this whole this whole concept of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.630" end="00:38:32.360" style="s2">deciding Jim is absolutely key to team</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.570" end="00:38:35.810" style="s2">productivity so you know leadership</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.360" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">needs to look at this as a game design</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.810" end="00:38:42.380" style="s2">so yeah certain decisions are set aside</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.380" end="00:38:45.020" style="s2">for formally authorized leaders and</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.380" end="00:38:47.600" style="s2">teams don&#39;t make those decisions but a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.020" end="00:38:50.600" style="s2">certain number of decisions that do not</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.600" end="00:38:53.420" style="s2">fall below a certain threshold in terms</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:58.600" style="s2">of frequency or number are given to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.420" end="00:39:01.160" style="s2">team why because the decisions generates</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.600" end="00:39:03.500" style="s2">engagement it gets in the head of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.160" end="00:39:05.840" style="s2">developers and they get in the game and</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.500" end="00:39:08.600" style="s2">now they&#39;re really creating something if</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.840" end="00:39:11.020" style="s2">the decisions they&#39;re making falls below</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.600" end="00:39:14.990" style="s2">a certain frequency or or number or</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.020" end="00:39:17.510" style="s2">volume they will check out they will</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.990" end="00:39:20.390" style="s2">literally start to just say you know I</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.510" end="00:39:21.860" style="s2">don&#39;t care whatever Bob says and and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.390" end="00:39:23.360" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s gonna be yeah I hate</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.860" end="00:39:25.940" style="s2">that when people just become hands</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.360" end="00:39:28.340" style="s2">forget it right but the company has died</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.940" end="00:39:30.920" style="s2">right right we have to have heads and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.340" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">hands all the time and there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.920" end="00:39:35.120" style="s2">concept of learned helplessness have</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:36.380" style="s2">ever heard of this world oh yes I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.120" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">know how much you&#39;ve read of my writings</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.380" end="00:39:42.470" style="s2">about game B but that is we call a core</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:44.660" style="s2">example of game a malware is learned</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.470" end="00:39:46.430" style="s2">helplessness but I you explain for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.660" end="00:39:48.200" style="s2">audience would it be well what it base</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.430" end="00:39:51.410" style="s2">means is at some point if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.200" end="00:39:53.089" style="s2">experiencing pain and you try to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.410" end="00:39:55.460" style="s2">away from it and you can&#39;t get away from</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.089" end="00:39:57.710" style="s2">it at some point you give up and even</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.460" end="00:39:58.400" style="s2">though the exit door is right under your</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.710" end="00:40:00.890" style="s2">nose</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.400" end="00:40:03.890" style="s2">you won&#39;t even you won&#39;t even look for</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.890" end="00:40:07.609" style="s2">it anymore and you just resign yourself</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.890" end="00:40:09.380" style="s2">to the pain because you know other</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.609" end="00:40:11.660" style="s2">people&#39;s other people&#39;s situation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.380" end="00:40:14.510" style="s2">good but what mine really sucks you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.660" end="00:40:16.730" style="s2">and when that happens the productivity</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.510" end="00:40:19.040" style="s2">drops dramatically in exponential</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.730" end="00:40:21.319" style="s2">fashion so what&#39;s happening is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.040" end="00:40:22.790" style="s2">if you if you learn it over the teams</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.319" end="00:40:25.339" style="s2">you if you take all the decisions away</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.790" end="00:40:27.470" style="s2">you make all the decisions for them they</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.339" end="00:40:30.680" style="s2">will give up on engaging and then they</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.470" end="00:40:32.990" style="s2">will also give up on everything and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.680" end="00:40:34.339" style="s2">they&#39;ll just become zombies and this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.990" end="00:40:37.579" style="s2">what goes on in a lot of organizations</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.339" end="00:40:39.950" style="s2">all over the world you know and scrum is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.579" end="00:40:42.530" style="s2">actually a way out of that right because</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.950" end="00:40:44.900" style="s2">it&#39;s saying in through its rule set no</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.530" end="00:40:47.510" style="s2">some of the decisions belong to the team</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.900" end="00:40:49.309" style="s2">here&#39;s the definition of those decisions</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.510" end="00:40:51.260" style="s2">and these these rules are not to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.309" end="00:40:53.089" style="s2">trifled with if you want to produce good</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.260" end="00:40:55.130" style="s2">software and so one of them let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.089" end="00:40:57.290" style="s2">back to the topic is that the team</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.130" end="00:40:59.180" style="s2">should be allowed to choose which a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.290" end="00:41:02.089" style="s2">jewelled discipline they want to follow</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.180" end="00:41:04.040" style="s2">is that correct absolutely because not</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.089" end="00:41:06.109" style="s2">every team not every project or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.040" end="00:41:08.569" style="s2">every program not every product is an</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.109" end="00:41:10.460" style="s2">agile product some are some set</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.569" end="00:41:13.430" style="s2">sunsetting projects that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.460" end="00:41:16.460" style="s2">well understood and do not require</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.430" end="00:41:17.990" style="s2">empiricism for the divino for process</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.460" end="00:41:21.290" style="s2">efficiency you know it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.990" end="00:41:24.349" style="s2">projects or ABC products or ABC but new</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.290" end="00:41:26.839" style="s2">product development a lot of variants in</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.349" end="00:41:29.690" style="s2">it a lot of unprinted predictability a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.839" end="00:41:31.430" style="s2">lot of uncertainty you use empirical</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.690" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">process control for that you use</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.430" end="00:41:33.829" style="s2">something like scrum that&#39;s your way out</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:35.270" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.829" end="00:41:37.520" style="s2">but at my point I guess I&#39;m getting a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.270" end="00:41:39.829" style="s2">more narrow point is that the executives</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.520" end="00:41:41.900" style="s2">should allow the teams to choose which</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.829" end="00:41:43.730" style="s2">of the agile disciplines they might want</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">to use that&#39;s right an open-space</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.730" end="00:41:47.990" style="s2">agility what we say is the constraint</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.660" style="s2">that we put in you know we have a 90-day</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.990" end="00:41:54.010" style="s2">experimental window where we try some</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.660" end="00:41:56.630" style="s2">new process and the constraint is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.010" end="00:41:58.460" style="s2">agile principles the twelve agile</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.630" end="00:42:00.049" style="s2">principles in the manifesto so what we</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.460" end="00:42:02.299" style="s2">say to the teams is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.049" end="00:42:03.890" style="s2">any process you like but don&#39;t violate</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.299" end="00:42:05.449" style="s2">these principles if you violate these</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.890" end="00:42:08.390" style="s2">principles we&#39;re gonna take you out</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.449" end="00:42:09.769" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get a talking-to but go</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.390" end="00:42:12.410" style="s2">ahead use whatever you like within</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.769" end="00:42:14.599" style="s2">within these constraints and that turns</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.410" end="00:42:16.369" style="s2">out to be rather confining but also</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.599" end="00:42:18.829" style="s2">rather liberating at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.369" end="00:42:21.709" style="s2">because they are choosing within a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.829" end="00:42:22.969" style="s2">fairly choosable range right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.709" end="00:42:24.859" style="s2">narrower range but there&#39;s still some</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.969" end="00:42:26.539" style="s2">choice there they can use Kanban they</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.859" end="00:42:29.689" style="s2">can use scrum they can use other</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.539" end="00:42:34.189" style="s2">empirical approaches and the act of</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.689" end="00:42:37.069" style="s2">choosing is very engaging and that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.189" end="00:42:39.829" style="s2">know the team itself becomes happier</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.069" end="00:42:43.459" style="s2">that happiness gets associated with you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.829" end="00:42:45.769" style="s2">know up tempo up tone and in boom</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.459" end="00:42:47.479" style="s2">outcomes high quality product just for</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.769" end="00:42:48.709" style="s2">getting for our audience who many of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.479" end="00:42:51.319" style="s2">them are not professional software</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.709" end="00:42:53.390" style="s2">developers but they may be executives</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.319" end="00:42:54.859" style="s2">who have those functions under them what</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.390" end="00:42:57.499" style="s2">are some of the names of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.859" end="00:43:00.049" style="s2">other approaches other than scrum just</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.499" end="00:43:02.569" style="s2">so people have heard the words yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.049" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">two primary tools that are used today</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.569" end="00:43:07.849" style="s2">Jim are the Kanban method which is</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:10.429" style="s2">pioneered by a fellow named David</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.849" end="00:43:14.449" style="s2">Anderson and scrum and then within that</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.429" end="00:43:17.299" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s other practices</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.449" end="00:43:19.219" style="s2">that are used so for example under the</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.299" end="00:43:22.039" style="s2">heading of XP or extreme programming</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.219" end="00:43:25.099" style="s2">there&#39;s pair programming continuous</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.039" end="00:43:27.079" style="s2">integration ideas like this that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.099" end="00:43:29.779" style="s2">you incorporate and make part of your</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.079" end="00:43:32.170" style="s2">your your sort of role your own method</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.779" end="00:43:34.789" style="s2">so if you go to extreme programming</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.170" end="00:43:37.329" style="s2">you&#39;ll see you know many things in there</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.789" end="00:43:40.579" style="s2">like refactoring this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.329" end="00:43:42.529" style="s2">refactoring is is a programming practice</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.579" end="00:43:44.539" style="s2">where you restructure the code it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.529" end="00:43:47.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t change the functionality but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.539" end="00:43:49.249" style="s2">increases the overall robustness of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.239" end="00:43:51.709" style="s2">code reduces the brittleness makes it</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.249" end="00:43:53.779" style="s2">softer makes it more malleable you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.709" end="00:43:56.869" style="s2">this kind of thing yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.779" end="00:44:00.349" style="s2">pop up a level we&#39;ve talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.869" end="00:44:03.079" style="s2">agile itself now let&#39;s talk about your</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.349" end="00:44:05.420" style="s2">bigger picture open space technology</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.079" end="00:44:07.910" style="s2">married to agile wanting to take people</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.420" end="00:44:09.349" style="s2">through what open space is and get one</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.910" end="00:44:11.329" style="s2">to some detail and you know talk about</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.349" end="00:44:13.250" style="s2">your principles and the roles and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.329" end="00:44:16.370" style="s2">kind of thing take five or ten minutes</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.250" end="00:44:18.290" style="s2">all right so open space technology you</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.370" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">know what is it it&#39;s basically it</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.290" end="00:44:21.950" style="s2">basically creates the conditions where</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.050" style="s2">people can be themselves where they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.950" end="00:44:25.070" style="s2">make decisions and act on what they want</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.050" end="00:44:27.770" style="s2">to learn and how they want to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.070" end="00:44:29.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about the starting</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.770" end="00:44:32.360" style="s2">conditions for an open space meeting in</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.840" end="00:44:35.030" style="s2">an organization right it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.360" end="00:44:37.940" style="s2">three or four starting conditions maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.030" end="00:44:40.250" style="s2">five here they are number one we have a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.940" end="00:44:43.340" style="s2">matter of mind-numbing complexity where</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.250" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">no one person has the answer or claims</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.340" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">to right that&#39;s number one number two is</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:52.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a diversity of opinion about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:55.670" style="s2">pro and con and people really care about</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.190" end="00:44:57.560" style="s2">it so there&#39;s heat around the issue pro</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.670" end="00:45:00.110" style="s2">and con about how to solve this thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.560" end="00:45:02.030" style="s2">everyone has an opinion about it the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.110" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">third condition is this high potential</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.030" end="00:45:07.190" style="s2">for conflict as we process this thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:09.890" style="s2">and the fourth one is a decision time of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.190" end="00:45:12.680" style="s2">yesterday like we&#39;ve already waited too</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.890" end="00:45:19.870" style="s2">long and we need to do something now</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.680" end="00:45:23.150" style="s2">right so those conditions are ideal for</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.870" end="00:45:24.290" style="s2">enterprise wide organizational change</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.150" end="00:45:26.690" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.290" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">this makes the open space meeting you</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.690" end="00:45:34.040" style="s2">know highly conducive to an efficient</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:36.530" style="s2">change experience so the open space</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.040" end="00:45:39.110" style="s2">meeting is Invitational in nature no one</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.530" end="00:45:41.750" style="s2">can make you go to it a formally</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.110" end="00:45:45.800" style="s2">authorized higher up authorizes the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.750" end="00:45:48.200" style="s2">and the space develops a theme which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.800" end="00:45:50.150" style="s2">wide enough to contain everyone&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.200" end="00:45:52.910" style="s2">know issues but narrow narrow enough to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.150" end="00:45:54.710" style="s2">focus the group typically that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.910" end="00:45:58.340" style="s2">developed with a cross-section of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.710" end="00:46:02.210" style="s2">people of influencers and in people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.340" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">the organization and then the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.210" end="00:46:07.160" style="s2">organization&#39;s given a couple weeks to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:10.220" style="s2">process you know an invitation that this</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.160" end="00:46:12.650" style="s2">leader sends out then when the day comes</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.220" end="00:46:14.150" style="s2">the people who are strongly attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.650" end="00:46:15.740" style="s2">the issue who feel passionate and</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.150" end="00:46:18.170" style="s2">responsibility around the issue they</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.740" end="00:46:19.730" style="s2">show up at the meeting let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.170" end="00:46:21.500" style="s2">jump in let me jump in here just for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.730" end="00:46:24.290" style="s2">second one thing I try to do in all my</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.500" end="00:46:26.360" style="s2">podcast is get down to tangible examples</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.290" end="00:46:27.050" style="s2">and so as you&#39;re going through this I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.360" end="00:46:29.570" style="s2">love to</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.050" end="00:46:32.210" style="s2">an example that we both agree would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.570" end="00:46:34.460" style="s2">appropriate for use of this process and</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.210" end="00:46:35.990" style="s2">as I was listening to you it struck me</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.460" end="00:46:38.390" style="s2">that one that fit all three of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.990" end="00:46:42.140" style="s2">criteria in the right context would be</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.390" end="00:46:44.300" style="s2">the classic problem for a successful but</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.140" end="00:46:47.690" style="s2">still early-stage company is what should</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.300" end="00:46:50.750" style="s2">our next product be yes that is a great</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.690" end="00:46:52.550" style="s2">theme statement and so interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.750" end="00:46:54.740" style="s2">you put a question mark at the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.550" end="00:46:57.290" style="s2">because themes typically have a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.740" end="00:46:59.330" style="s2">mark at the end because question marks</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.290" end="00:47:01.460" style="s2">tend to open the conversation where a</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.330" end="00:47:03.290" style="s2">period tends to close the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.460" end="00:47:04.850" style="s2">write them and frankly one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.290" end="00:47:06.590" style="s2">that some startups I&#39;ve been involved</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.850" end="00:47:07.940" style="s2">with is should we even have a next</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.590" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">product or should we continue to just</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.940" end="00:47:11.600" style="s2">invest in our current product and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:14.180" style="s2">big tension there&#39;s lots of controversy</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.600" end="00:47:16.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s a big stake yes because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.180" end="00:47:17.930" style="s2">could be you know half of our free cash</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.040" end="00:47:19.370" style="s2">flow next year do we put it into</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.930" end="00:47:21.290" style="s2">improving our current product and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.370" end="00:47:23.540" style="s2">build a next product right so let&#39;s use</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.290" end="00:47:25.310" style="s2">that as when you&#39;re listening to Daniels</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.540" end="00:47:26.930" style="s2">talk about the process think in mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.310" end="00:47:29.390" style="s2">that this is for you know a company that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.930" end="00:47:31.430" style="s2">has one product doing 4 million a year</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.390" end="00:47:33.230" style="s2">they&#39;ve just reached breakeven positive</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.430" end="00:47:34.550" style="s2">cash flow and should we have a next</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.230" end="00:47:36.560" style="s2">product and if so what will it be</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.550" end="00:47:39.110" style="s2">that will be our our high-stakes topic</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.560" end="00:47:41.030" style="s2">so continue beautiful yeah so so the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.110" end="00:47:43.190" style="s2">formally authorized leader who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.030" end="00:47:45.650" style="s2">function as a sponsor in the host who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.380" end="00:47:53.840" style="s2">the opportunities and the threats that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.120" end="00:47:56.360" style="s2">the group is facing invites everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.840" end="00:47:58.070" style="s2">show up kind of sets the boundaries for</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.360" end="00:47:59.870" style="s2">the thing namely that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.070" end="00:48:01.010" style="s2">looking for some solutions is going to</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.870" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">be a book of proceedings that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.010" end="00:48:05.780" style="s2">generated and we intend to act on those</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:07.610" style="s2">proceedings after we fin of this meeting</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.780" end="00:48:09.950" style="s2">so the meeting is just the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.610" end="00:48:12.470" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use the proceedings as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.950" end="00:48:14.510" style="s2">basis for action moving forward they</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.470" end="00:48:16.370" style="s2">send out as widely as they possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.510" end="00:48:17.960" style="s2">as many people that might be affected by</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.370" end="00:48:19.460" style="s2">the issue we&#39;re invited to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.960" end="00:48:22.340" style="s2">and then either they go or not they all</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.460" end="00:48:24.260" style="s2">receive the proceedings that sent to</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.340" end="00:48:27.050" style="s2">them it&#39;s like a PDF on a shared network</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.260" end="00:48:29.930" style="s2">drive or something like that after the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.050" end="00:48:31.910" style="s2">event happens now inside the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.930" end="00:48:34.730" style="s2">they might provide a link that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.910" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">describes what open space is an open</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.730" end="00:48:39.830" style="s2">space is a as a gathering</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.770" end="00:48:40.740" style="s2">it&#39;s an invitational gathering around a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.830" end="00:48:43.619" style="s2">theme</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.740" end="00:48:45.630" style="s2">and there&#39;s five principles to open</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.619" end="00:48:48.840" style="s2">space and and here it&#39;s in this one law</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.630" end="00:48:52.950" style="s2">right so here&#39;s the five principles</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.840" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">right first one is wherever it happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.950" end="00:48:57.270" style="s2">is the right place you know there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:59.190" style="s2">where ever you do an open space it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.270" end="00:49:00.930" style="s2">perfect place it&#39;s it&#39;s good enough it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.190" end="00:49:04.080" style="s2">going to happen exactly one time they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.930" end="00:49:07.380" style="s2">in this way and and we&#39;re doing it right</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.080" end="00:49:11.400" style="s2">here the second one is whenever it</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.380" end="00:49:14.160" style="s2">starts is the right time the idea here</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.400" end="00:49:17.760" style="s2">is that the normal rules of punctuality</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.160" end="00:49:19.710" style="s2">are suspended in open space the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.760" end="00:49:22.770" style="s2">will start when it starts and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.710" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">pretty much when the people show up when</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.770" end="00:49:26.490" style="s2">they all sit down if it&#39;s supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:28.520" style="s2">start at 9:00 people get there early you</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.490" end="00:49:30.750" style="s2">know maybe it starts quote-unquote early</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.520" end="00:49:32.910" style="s2">people if people show up a little later</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.750" end="00:49:34.890" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s quote-unquote late</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.910" end="00:49:38.369" style="s2">there is no earlier late in open space</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.890" end="00:49:42.869" style="s2">there&#39;s just whenever it starts the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.369" end="00:49:45.300" style="s2">principle is whoever comes are the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.869" end="00:49:48.540" style="s2">people so when we have one of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.300" end="00:49:50.490" style="s2">meetings the people who show up we know</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.540" end="00:49:52.910" style="s2">for sure why they showed up and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.490" end="00:49:55.109" style="s2">to say we&#39;re attracted to the invitation</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.910" end="00:49:56.730" style="s2">right the people who didn&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.109" end="00:49:59.130" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s eighty-seven thousand</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.730" end="00:50:00.510" style="s2">reasons for no but there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.130" end="00:50:02.310" style="s2">reason for a yes and that&#39;s that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.510" end="00:50:04.440" style="s2">found the invitation attractive so</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.310" end="00:50:05.820" style="s2">whoever shows up are the right people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.440" end="00:50:09.060" style="s2">people who found an invitation</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.820" end="00:50:11.880" style="s2">attractive then the next principle is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.060" end="00:50:12.900" style="s2">whatever happens is the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.880" end="00:50:15.480" style="s2">could have happened</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.900" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no preset agenda in an open</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.480" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">space meeting there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:22.500" style="s2">things that can happen and occur so</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a slogan and open space be</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.500" end="00:50:26.790" style="s2">prepared to be surprised right so one</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.200" end="00:50:28.650" style="s2">definition of being surprised is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.790" end="00:50:31.410" style="s2">you learn something so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.650" end="00:50:34.920" style="s2">learning that goes on in open space the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.410" end="00:50:39.119" style="s2">last principle is when it&#39;s over it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">over so some small sessions throughout</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.119" end="00:50:42.869" style="s2">the day might end you know a little</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:46.080" style="s2">early they might they might go out in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.869" end="00:50:48.210" style="s2">the hall and continue the whole day we</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.080" end="00:50:50.310" style="s2">don&#39;t know how long a session is going</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.210" end="00:50:52.140" style="s2">to go or who&#39;s going to show up what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.310" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">going to be said what&#39;s going to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.140" end="00:50:59.079" style="s2">so these principles are recited by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.319" end="00:51:01.809" style="s2">facilitator during the event</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.079" end="00:51:04.029" style="s2">everyone assembles in a big circle the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.809" end="00:51:05.650" style="s2">sponsor who invited everyone reminds</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.029" end="00:51:07.359" style="s2">everyone about the opportunities the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.650" end="00:51:09.819" style="s2">threats the theme why we&#39;re here and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.359" end="00:51:11.799" style="s2">then introduces the facilitator and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.819" end="00:51:13.869" style="s2">the facilitator will you know explain</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.799" end="00:51:15.880" style="s2">these principles now I&#39;ve facilitated</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.869" end="00:51:18.099" style="s2">dozens of these meetings and what what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.880" end="00:51:20.890" style="s2">find happens is by the time again around</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.099" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">to the third principle a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.890" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">start smiling at me and it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:28.180" style="s2">they realize that this whole five</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:29.400" style="s2">principles in one law thing I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.180" end="00:51:32.799" style="s2">tell you the law in a minute</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.400" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s a sort of metaphor for</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.799" end="00:51:38.109" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re free so as I recite</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:39.400" style="s2">the principles I get the feeling okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.109" end="00:51:40.749" style="s2">I&#39;m free to do what I want nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.400" end="00:51:42.999" style="s2">make me do what I want here</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.749" end="00:51:46.420" style="s2">nobody can not not do what I want but</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.999" end="00:51:49.719" style="s2">nobody can make me do anything that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.420" end="00:51:52.029" style="s2">unwilling to do at this meeting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.719" end="00:51:54.670" style="s2">all basically equal and authority here</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.029" end="00:51:57.069" style="s2">so when they get that they start smiling</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.670" end="00:51:59.380" style="s2">at you and this is this is the vibe of</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.069" end="00:52:00.939" style="s2">open space so one of the things one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.380" end="00:52:03.819" style="s2">the conditions is a high potential for</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.939" end="00:52:05.619" style="s2">conflict there&#39;s a law there&#39;s one law</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.819" end="00:52:09.489" style="s2">and open space here&#39;s the lock the law</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.619" end="00:52:11.949" style="s2">of two feet if you are not getting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.489" end="00:52:14.679" style="s2">kind of learning that you are seeking or</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.949" end="00:52:16.630" style="s2">I&#39;m getting the opportunity to make the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.679" end="00:52:19.660" style="s2">kind of contribution that you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.630" end="00:52:21.160" style="s2">making your two feet can take you</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.660" end="00:52:21.729" style="s2">somewhere else where you can get those</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.160" end="00:52:23.499" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.729" end="00:52:26.619" style="s2">leave where leave the session you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.499" end="00:52:30.309" style="s2">and go to another one so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.619" end="00:52:32.829" style="s2">couple of sort of sub roles in this open</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.309" end="00:52:34.660" style="s2">space thing there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sponsor</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.829" end="00:52:36.459" style="s2">there&#39;s a facilitator and then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.660" end="00:52:38.609" style="s2">participants but the participants can</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.459" end="00:52:39.910" style="s2">also can function as what we might call</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.609" end="00:52:41.709" style="s2">bumblebees</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.910" end="00:52:43.539" style="s2">they just move from session to session</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.709" end="00:52:45.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t spend too much time in any</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.539" end="00:52:47.709" style="s2">one session they kind of pollinate the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.400" end="00:52:49.479" style="s2">conversation across all the different</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.709" end="00:52:52.559" style="s2">small group sessions that have taken</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.479" end="00:52:55.630" style="s2">place and then there&#39;s this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.559" end="00:52:57.339" style="s2">you know this behavior like a butterfly</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.630" end="00:52:59.289" style="s2">people hang out they don&#39;t go to any</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.339" end="00:53:01.269" style="s2">sessions and don&#39;t call any sessions</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.289" end="00:53:02.920" style="s2">they&#39;re usually found by the food and</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.269" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">beverages having conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.920" end="00:53:07.090" style="s2">people and they&#39;re just in the space</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:09.160" style="s2">right so the bumble bees and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.090" end="00:53:10.990" style="s2">butterflies yeah so again let&#39;s get down</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.160" end="00:53:12.910" style="s2">to tangible so again as I recall how</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.990" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">this thing works there&#39;s an opening</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.910" end="00:53:18.010" style="s2">meeting where everybody shows up right</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:19.570" style="s2">yeah big circle yep big circle everyone</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.010" end="00:53:21.370" style="s2">so let&#39;s say 500 let&#39;s say the company</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.570" end="00:53:24.310" style="s2">has a hundred people they all show up</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.370" end="00:53:26.170" style="s2">and like a master of ceremonies as I</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.310" end="00:53:26.650" style="s2">recall starts the thing off so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.170" end="00:53:28.420" style="s2">start</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.650" end="00:53:30.340" style="s2">you know just run they run the example</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:33.130" style="s2">through yeah this part&#39;s just ends up</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.340" end="00:53:34.960" style="s2">welcomes everyone reminds everyone about</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.130" end="00:53:37.570" style="s2">the opportunities and threats in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.960" end="00:53:38.770" style="s2">theme hopes everyone has a great day and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.570" end="00:53:40.390" style="s2">reminds them that we&#39;re here to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.770" end="00:53:42.310" style="s2">those proceedings because we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.390" end="00:53:44.110" style="s2">act on them afterwards then that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.310" end="00:53:46.900" style="s2">highly authorized the authority figure</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.110" end="00:53:49.120" style="s2">who invited everyone sits down or well</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.900" end="00:53:51.250" style="s2">introduces the facilitator and sits down</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.120" end="00:53:52.510" style="s2">and then the facilitator stands up and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.250" end="00:53:54.040" style="s2">takes the people through the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.510" end="00:53:55.780" style="s2">process of getting underway</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.040" end="00:53:58.360" style="s2">so you could think of it like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.780" end="00:54:00.940" style="s2">there&#39;s a convergence of everyone at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.360" end="00:54:02.830" style="s2">beginning of the meeting Jim and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.940" end="00:54:05.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a divergence throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.830" end="00:54:06.550" style="s2">where we move into small groups like so</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.020" end="00:54:08.590" style="s2">for example at one o&#39;clock there might</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.550" end="00:54:11.020" style="s2">be seven different small meetings going</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.590" end="00:54:12.550" style="s2">on in the big room one in each corner</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.020" end="00:54:16.090" style="s2">and you know spread out around the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.550" end="00:54:19.120" style="s2">entire hall usually these meetings are</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.090" end="00:54:20.830" style="s2">held in a very large you know Ballroom</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:23.380" style="s2">in a in a hotel or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.830" end="00:54:25.360" style="s2">so if you&#39;re in a small session you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.380" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">look around and see six seven of eight</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.360" end="00:54:28.900" style="s2">other sessions going on and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:31.420" style="s2">your friends colleagues and peers at</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.900" end="00:54:34.030" style="s2">those sessions and you can also count</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.420" end="00:54:36.070" style="s2">the attendance at those sessions and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.030" end="00:54:37.690" style="s2">can listen to the noise level of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.070" end="00:54:39.430" style="s2">going on and then the level of passion</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.690" end="00:54:40.750" style="s2">you know if something grabs you you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.430" end="00:54:43.030" style="s2">just get up and leave and go see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.750" end="00:54:46.090" style="s2">going on over there that&#39;s what goes on</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.030" end="00:54:48.130" style="s2">throughout the day so at any given time</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.090" end="00:54:50.080" style="s2">at one o&#39;clock at two o&#39;clock at three</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.130" end="00:54:52.930" style="s2">o&#39;clock there&#39;s seven or eight different</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.080" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">things that you can graze on topics and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.930" end="00:54:57.850" style="s2">when the meeting opens people announce</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.480" end="00:55:01.060" style="s2">those sessions and they put them on a on</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.850" end="00:55:03.370" style="s2">a grid on the wall there&#39;s a big blank</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.060" end="00:55:05.590" style="s2">wall at the beginning of the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.370" end="00:55:08.140" style="s2">and at the end of the beginning that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.590" end="00:55:13.510" style="s2">wall is filled up with sessions in each</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.140" end="00:55:14.770" style="s2">each session is it&#39;s going to occur at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.510" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">certain time in a certain place</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.770" end="00:55:18.730" style="s2">throughout the day and people can go up</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">to that wall and plan their</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.730" end="00:55:22.660" style="s2">day and at any given time at 1 o&#39;clock 2</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.950" end="00:55:24.460" style="s2">o&#39;clock or three o&#39;clock this you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.660" end="00:55:28.900" style="s2">seven things to pick from 8 things to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.460" end="00:55:31.990" style="s2">pick from and then at the end we reek we</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.900" end="00:55:34.480" style="s2">reconverge and we have a closing circle</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.990" end="00:55:36.670" style="s2">and that&#39;s where people offer their</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.480" end="00:55:38.800" style="s2">reflections on their experience today we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.670" end="00:55:40.900" style="s2">have a formal closing and then we then</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.800" end="00:55:43.030" style="s2">everyone so we D convene and everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.900" end="00:55:46.090" style="s2">dismissed sounds pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.030" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">now you keep the available sessions up</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.090" end="00:55:50.080" style="s2">on a physical board I&#39;m thinking in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:52.150" style="s2">head it&#39;d be kind of cool to have an app</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.080" end="00:55:53.950" style="s2">so that you know new new sessions could</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.150" end="00:55:55.420" style="s2">come and go and you could look at your</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.950" end="00:55:57.430" style="s2">app and especially well if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.420" end="00:55:58.690" style="s2">have your right to vote with your feet</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.430" end="00:56:00.070" style="s2">you could say god damn this session</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.690" end="00:56:01.840" style="s2">sucks let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening right</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.070" end="00:56:03.369" style="s2">now all right yeah have you tried</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.840" end="00:56:05.440" style="s2">anything like that you know I have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.369" end="00:56:08.109" style="s2">great story about that for you if you</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.440" end="00:56:10.270" style="s2">want I could tell you about it sure it</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.109" end="00:56:12.100" style="s2">was actually a capital one it was the</p>

<p begin="00:56:12.100" end="00:56:17.230" style="s2">expecting 400 people at the event we did</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.980" end="00:56:20.500" style="s2">in two different cities we did it in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.230" end="00:56:22.510" style="s2">first city I was a I brought some people</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.500" end="00:56:24.580" style="s2">in who had more experience than me with</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.510" end="00:56:26.830" style="s2">with open space because I felt that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.580" end="00:56:29.020" style="s2">needed that help and one of the women</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.830" end="00:56:30.550" style="s2">who I invited she came up to me and she</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.020" end="00:56:32.369" style="s2">was very gentle about it and everything</p>

<p begin="00:56:50.050" end="00:56:53.650" style="s2">marketplace is so big and people don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.830" end="00:57:18.280" style="s2">management and self organization</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.420" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to manage anything I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.280" end="00:57:21.369" style="s2">going to authorize the management of</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.170" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">decision and she&#39;s like well okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.410" end="00:57:38.260" style="s2">and then we opened up the the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:40.330" style="s2">opening and we went through the one law</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.260" end="00:57:41.920" style="s2">the five principles to be prepared to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.330" end="00:57:44.110" style="s2">surprised and everything else about open</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.920" end="00:57:45.790" style="s2">space we told them what to do and how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.110" end="00:57:47.500" style="s2">do it and then invited him to come in</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.790" end="00:57:49.360" style="s2">the center of the circle and write their</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.500" end="00:57:52.180" style="s2">session down and grab the microphone and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.360" end="00:57:55.240" style="s2">announce it to the group and this one</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.180" end="00:57:58.600" style="s2">guy just made a beeline for the center</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.240" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">of the circle and immediately announced</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.600" end="00:58:03.070" style="s2">this session put it on the wall and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.880" end="00:58:05.830" style="s2">he hung out over there and then other</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.070" end="00:58:07.780" style="s2">people did the same thing they headed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.830" end="00:58:09.790" style="s2">the wall and he guided them and coach</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.780" end="00:58:12.160" style="s2">them on how to do the marketplace what</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.790" end="00:58:13.990" style="s2">that dude had going on was he had an app</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.160" end="00:58:16.210" style="s2">on his phone that he wanted everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.990" end="00:58:17.830" style="s2">use which which would socialize the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.210" end="00:58:20.530" style="s2">marketplace and made it easy for people</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.830" end="00:58:22.000" style="s2">to keep it in their phone and he wanted</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.530" end="00:58:25.420" style="s2">to make sure everyone had a shot at</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.000" end="00:58:28.480" style="s2">using his application so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.420" end="00:58:31.300" style="s2">cool w guys that is there now a commonly</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.480" end="00:58:34.120" style="s2">used app for that purpose there are some</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.300" end="00:58:37.030" style="s2">open space apps that automate and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.120" end="00:58:38.650" style="s2">facilitate the marketplace and also the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.030" end="00:58:41.410" style="s2">use of online open space so I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.650" end="00:58:43.630" style="s2">open spaces online you know with global</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.410" end="00:58:45.340" style="s2">audiences up to 200 people using zoom</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.630" end="00:58:47.230" style="s2">video yeah I remember we did one for</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.340" end="00:58:48.970" style="s2">rally point alpha it was kind of about</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.230" end="00:58:53.730" style="s2">two thirds of shitshow but that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.970" end="00:58:56.350" style="s2">your fault okay I don&#39;t remember that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.730" end="00:58:58.690" style="s2">Jordan show it up after having a certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.350" end="00:59:00.190" style="s2">procedure yeah I let him in but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.690" end="00:59:01.630" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s ancient history</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.190" end="00:59:04.330" style="s2">they&#39;ve done a good job of describing</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.630" end="00:59:06.310" style="s2">what an open-space meeting is now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.330" end="00:59:07.540" style="s2">pop up to your next level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.310" end="00:59:09.670" style="s2">at least as I took it out of your book</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.540" end="00:59:12.190" style="s2">which is let&#39;s say a company has to</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.670" end="00:59:14.470" style="s2">convince itself it wants to deploy agile</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.190" end="00:59:17.470" style="s2">where appropriate let teams choose to</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.470" end="00:59:20.320" style="s2">use agile or not to choose what&#39;s flavor</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.470" end="00:59:23.020" style="s2">of an agile or not etc and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.320" end="00:59:24.270" style="s2">embedded this as a first round of what</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.020" end="00:59:26.860" style="s2">you called a hundred days of</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.270" end="00:59:28.060" style="s2">experimentation could you talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.860" end="00:59:30.840" style="s2">framework of a hundred days of</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.060" end="00:59:34.270" style="s2">experimentation and how open space and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.840" end="00:59:36.340" style="s2">agile essentially self-organized over a</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.270" end="00:59:40.060" style="s2">hundred days within an organization yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.340" end="00:59:42.850" style="s2">so when you bring procedural change ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.060" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">of working change organizational change</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.850" end="00:59:47.230" style="s2">that creates anxiety people get worried</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:49.780" style="s2">and when people are worried and afraid</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.230" end="00:59:52.570" style="s2">they can&#39;t learn very good and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.780" end="00:59:55.720" style="s2">agile is all about learning adapting and</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.570" end="00:59:58.840" style="s2">changing and pivoting so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.720" end="01:00:00.520" style="s2">doing there is we&#39;re bracketing the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.840" end="01:00:03.700" style="s2">learning experience so it has a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.520" end="01:00:06.130" style="s2">beginning a middle and an end that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.700" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">begins and ends with an open space</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.130" end="01:00:10.540" style="s2">meeting and in the middle we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:14.280" style="s2">use that we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.540" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">experimentation we&#39;re gonna do iteration</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.280" end="01:00:20.140" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do adaptation and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:23.500" style="s2">gonna do inspection right so those are</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.140" end="01:00:25.570" style="s2">core agile ideas we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.500" end="01:00:27.520" style="s2">to inspect we&#39;re going to adapt we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.570" end="01:00:30.790" style="s2">gonna work in iterations and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.520" end="01:00:32.500" style="s2">to experiment in an iterative fashion so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.790" end="01:00:34.770" style="s2">what we&#39;re really doing here is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.500" end="01:00:38.830" style="s2">taking those team level ideas Jim and</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.770" end="01:00:41.470" style="s2">we&#39;re making them first-class objects at</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.830" end="01:00:46.480" style="s2">the level of enterprise and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.470" end="01:00:50.590" style="s2">executing on a hundred day iteration of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.480" end="01:00:52.900" style="s2">change where there&#39;s an inspection at</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.590" end="01:00:54.790" style="s2">the end we&#39;re gonna have a referendum on</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.900" end="01:00:57.420" style="s2">what worked what didn&#39;t work and what we</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.790" end="01:01:01.300" style="s2">want to change at the enterprise level</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.420" end="01:01:04.720" style="s2">and this has a profound effect on people</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.300" end="01:01:06.760" style="s2">that&#39;ll resist it okay because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.720" end="01:01:08.380" style="s2">not being asked to do this for the rest</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.760" end="01:01:11.710" style="s2">of their lives they&#39;re being asked to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.380" end="01:01:13.060" style="s2">this for a hundred days so what we do is</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.710" end="01:01:16.120" style="s2">we create what I call a chapter of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.060" end="01:01:17.980" style="s2">learning and that is is bookended by</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.120" end="01:01:21.070" style="s2">these two open space events so at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.980" end="01:01:23.950" style="s2">first open space and this is key the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.070" end="01:01:25.990" style="s2">leader the sponsor the host says to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.950" end="01:01:28.680" style="s2">folks not just we&#39;re here for the</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.990" end="01:01:31.120" style="s2">proceedings but if you like this meeting</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.680" end="01:01:31.920" style="s2">you know in a hundred days we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.120" end="01:01:36.550" style="s2">this again</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.920" end="01:01:38.290" style="s2">so suspend your disbelief and act as if</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.550" end="01:01:40.540" style="s2">and pretend that were what we&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.290" end="01:01:43.210" style="s2">to embark on in the next 90 days might</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.540" end="01:01:44.740" style="s2">actually work okay if it doesn&#39;t we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.210" end="01:01:46.510" style="s2">all gonna get it here everyone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.740" end="01:01:48.460" style="s2">get a hearing in a hundred days we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.510" end="01:01:49.810" style="s2">going to inspect this thing and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.460" end="01:01:52.750" style="s2">that didn&#39;t work we&#39;re gonna drop like a</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.810" end="01:01:54.550" style="s2">bad habit but we&#39;re moving in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.750" end="01:01:54.970" style="s2">direction of improvement one way or the</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.550" end="01:01:56.250" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.970" end="01:01:58.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.250" end="01:02:01.960" style="s2">but and that&#39;s interesting and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.570" end="01:02:03.130" style="s2">it&#39;s I would say psychologically wise is</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.960" end="01:02:05.470" style="s2">one of things I&#39;ve taken away from my</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.130" end="01:02:09.040" style="s2">business career is that most people</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.470" end="01:02:11.380" style="s2">really don&#39;t like ambiguity right</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.040" end="01:02:14.020" style="s2">there&#39;s only a few of us maniacs who</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.380" end="01:02:15.940" style="s2">actually thrive on it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.020" end="01:02:18.190" style="s2">willing to tolerate it in tolerable</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.940" end="01:02:20.200" style="s2">doses and so what you&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.190" end="01:02:23.920" style="s2">saying we&#39;re dosing this ambiguity for</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.200" end="01:02:26.020" style="s2">you that&#39;s exactly it that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.920" end="01:02:26.920" style="s2">right and and that&#39;s a very astute</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.020" end="01:02:29.170" style="s2">observation</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.920" end="01:02:30.700" style="s2">what what what happens when you bring</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.170" end="01:02:32.500" style="s2">when you bring the stuff to an</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.700" end="01:02:33.910" style="s2">organization is people get real nervous</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.500" end="01:02:34.500" style="s2">because here&#39;s what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.910" end="01:02:37.710" style="s2">Jim</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.500" end="01:02:40.540" style="s2">we are refactoring the authority</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.710" end="01:02:44.140" style="s2">distribution schema when we bring this</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.540" end="01:02:46.060" style="s2">agile stuff on people who made decisions</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.140" end="01:02:49.030" style="s2">about product yesterday don&#39;t make them</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.060" end="01:02:51.070" style="s2">today other people don&#39;t that makes a</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.030" end="01:02:52.720" style="s2">lot of people nervous about their kids</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.070" end="01:02:55.120" style="s2">college education about their own</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.720" end="01:02:56.320" style="s2">mortgage about their car payment and all</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.120" end="01:02:58.480" style="s2">this kind of stuff right their</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.320" end="01:03:00.100" style="s2">retirement the whole nine yards so so</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.480" end="01:03:01.540" style="s2">it&#39;s very triggering because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.100" end="01:03:04.600" style="s2">triggering this fight flight and</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.540" end="01:03:06.400" style="s2">survival instincts and then when people</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.600" end="01:03:08.470" style="s2">are triggered like that they you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.400" end="01:03:11.500" style="s2">they&#39;re not behaving rationally so what</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.470" end="01:03:14.140" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here is we&#39;re reducing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.500" end="01:03:15.880" style="s2">anxiety that is brought on by this</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.140" end="01:03:18.250" style="s2">ambiguity that you&#39;re talking about Jim</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.880" end="01:03:20.770" style="s2">again I compartmentalized it and further</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.250" end="01:03:22.960" style="s2">you I like the the concept where again</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.770" end="01:03:24.670" style="s2">there is no dictating to the teams that</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.960" end="01:03:27.310" style="s2">they must choose agile but they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.670" end="01:03:28.900" style="s2">learn about it and here&#39;s some ways that</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.310" end="01:03:30.940" style="s2">it may be good for them if they want to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.900" end="01:03:34.300" style="s2">they get to choose which is kind of cool</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.940" end="01:03:36.610" style="s2">then now popping up one more level as I</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.300" end="01:03:38.890" style="s2">understand your process you then have a</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.610" end="01:03:40.300" style="s2">repeating of these hundred days after</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.890" end="01:03:42.280" style="s2">the first hundred days if things went</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.300" end="01:03:43.840" style="s2">well enough people want to do ya know</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.280" end="01:03:46.090" style="s2">regarding the hundred days what we know</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.840" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">from experience now is that 45 to 90</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.090" end="01:03:50.620" style="s2">days is the sweet spot okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:53.470" style="s2">90 days is like you know one one</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.620" end="01:03:55.750" style="s2">material quarter on the calendar 45 days</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.470" end="01:03:59.530" style="s2">is half of that and lately there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.750" end="01:04:03.130" style="s2">a rash of this trend towards okay ours</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.530" end="01:04:07.720" style="s2">because of the John Doerr book and that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.130" end="01:04:10.030" style="s2">maps neatly to 90 day iterations so 45</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.720" end="01:04:12.670" style="s2">to 90 days is pretty much the Stan</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.030" end="01:04:14.500" style="s2">that we&#39;re using now okay but in terms</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.670" end="01:04:16.750" style="s2">of in terms of what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.500" end="01:04:18.970" style="s2">we&#39;re going to use iteration to just</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.750" end="01:04:20.590" style="s2">like what scrub the the metaphor is in</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.970" end="01:04:22.450" style="s2">scrum you have sprint planning you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.590" end="01:04:24.790" style="s2">the Sprint you have the Sprint review in</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.450" end="01:04:28.200" style="s2">open space agility you have the first</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.790" end="01:04:30.010" style="s2">open space meeting you have 90 days of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.200" end="01:04:32.890" style="s2">experiment with the new way of working</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.010" end="01:04:37.750" style="s2">and then you have the second open space</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.890" end="01:04:41.500" style="s2">meeting and that frame allows people to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.750" end="01:04:43.420" style="s2">make meaning of the situation so that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.500" end="01:04:45.670" style="s2">like your startup example where should</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.420" end="01:04:47.620" style="s2">we build a new product or not you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.670" end="01:04:49.060" style="s2">should we continue to go in our first</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.620" end="01:04:50.470" style="s2">product should we build the next product</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.060" end="01:04:52.120" style="s2">where we going to get the money from all</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.470" end="01:04:54.100" style="s2">this kind of stuff coming out of that</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.120" end="01:04:56.590" style="s2">first meeting there&#39;s a book of</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.100" end="01:04:58.570" style="s2">proceedings it&#39;s got a bunch of ideas in</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.590" end="01:05:01.990" style="s2">it the organization is going to act on</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.570" end="01:05:05.470" style="s2">some of those ideas in a you know 45 to</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.990" end="01:05:07.630" style="s2">90 day period and the idea is they will</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.470" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">look back and look forward in the next</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.630" end="01:05:11.410" style="s2">open space for instance maybe it came</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:13.060" style="s2">out of the first meeting here you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.410" end="01:05:14.830" style="s2">here&#39;s some research we need to do all</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.060" end="01:05:16.450" style="s2">right here&#39;s a little prototype we need</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.830" end="01:05:17.860" style="s2">to try to build right and we can&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.450" end="01:05:19.240" style="s2">the prototype and we probably shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.860" end="01:05:20.740" style="s2">try to build the product right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.240" end="01:05:22.600" style="s2">right so there could be it could be some</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.740" end="01:05:24.940" style="s2">action item is there any formal</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.600" end="01:05:27.910" style="s2">mechanism and open space to cook down</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.940" end="01:05:30.040" style="s2">the book to action items or is it not</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.910" end="01:05:31.240" style="s2">intended for that yeah open space</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.040" end="01:05:33.550" style="s2">meetings are intended to generate</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.240" end="01:05:35.350" style="s2">dialogue and ideas the Proceedings that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.550" end="01:05:37.630" style="s2">come out of an open space meeting that</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.350" end="01:05:40.120" style="s2">you know our output of it out of an open</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.630" end="01:05:41.680" style="s2">space become input into action planning</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.120" end="01:05:44.350" style="s2">they&#39;re not quite there but the neck</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.680" end="01:05:47.320" style="s2">typically the next day so so this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.350" end="01:05:48.820" style="s2">what typically I&#39;ve done and works</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.320" end="01:05:50.710" style="s2">really really well you have the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.820" end="01:05:52.660" style="s2">the next day the chairs are all in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.710" end="01:05:54.670" style="s2">circle you still in the same room people</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.660" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">come in and they inspect the proceedings</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.670" end="01:05:58.900" style="s2">they spend 30 40 minutes browsing the</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:00.730" style="s2">proceedings because you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.900" end="01:06:02.380" style="s2">go to every single session but every</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.730" end="01:06:03.070" style="s2">single session is documented in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.380" end="01:06:05.380" style="s2">proceedings</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.070" end="01:06:06.190" style="s2">so you leave through the proceedings you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.380" end="01:06:08.620" style="s2">thumb through it</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.190" end="01:06:10.870" style="s2">you pick off the ideas the themes and</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.620" end="01:06:12.850" style="s2">the major ideas that are in there you</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.870" end="01:06:14.800" style="s2">pick out the seven or eight top once</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.850" end="01:06:16.540" style="s2">those are presented to the you know the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.800" end="01:06:19.000" style="s2">leadership group the leadership group</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.540" end="01:06:21.940" style="s2">picks four or five things that they want</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.000" end="01:06:23.980" style="s2">the whole enterprise to focus on</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.940" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">and then you look for champions who are</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.980" end="01:06:27.640" style="s2">gonna gonna pull that together in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:30.550" style="s2">next 90 days they work directly with</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.640" end="01:06:33.040" style="s2">executive leadership yeah and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.550" end="01:06:35.560" style="s2">authorized to to champion that issue so</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.040" end="01:06:38.460" style="s2">what we usually do there in that session</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.560" end="01:06:40.540" style="s2">is we put one issue per flipchart on</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.460" end="01:06:42.490" style="s2">around the room so if there&#39;s five</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.540" end="01:06:45.339" style="s2">issues is five flipcharts each one with</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.490" end="01:06:47.319" style="s2">a different issue and then executive</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.339" end="01:06:48.940" style="s2">leader stands up and explains that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.319" end="01:06:50.829" style="s2">looking for people to champion these</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.940" end="01:06:52.990" style="s2">things in the next 90 days but before</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.829" end="01:06:55.180" style="s2">you jump out of your seat let&#39;s explain</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.990" end="01:06:57.040" style="s2">the gravity of what this means and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.180" end="01:06:59.560" style="s2">they lay out the constraints like one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.040" end="01:07:01.660" style="s2">the constraints might be if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.560" end="01:07:04.210" style="s2">volunteer you can&#39;t unvoluntary</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.660" end="01:07:06.490" style="s2">you&#39;re in for 90 days okay that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.210" end="01:07:08.140" style="s2">yeah you also commit to you know meeting</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.490" end="01:07:11.349" style="s2">with us once a week or every two weeks</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.140" end="01:07:13.329" style="s2">and you know some other constraints you</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.349" end="01:07:15.940" style="s2">know typically what you&#39;ll do is take</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.329" end="01:07:18.190" style="s2">the bottom 10% of somebody&#39;s workload</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.940" end="01:07:19.569" style="s2">and and distribute it to other people so</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.190" end="01:07:23.430" style="s2">they have ten percent of their time to</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.569" end="01:07:25.960" style="s2">work on this issue and that generates a</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.430" end="01:07:28.140" style="s2">tremendous amount of engagement when</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.960" end="01:07:30.849" style="s2">that&#39;s over and the leader says okay</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.140" end="01:07:33.010" style="s2">those of you that want to champion these</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.849" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">issues you know go stand next to the one</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.010" end="01:07:37.089" style="s2">that&#39;s really hot for you and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">usually about five six percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.089" end="01:07:41.380" style="s2">people get up and they stand up and they</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">stand up next to those issues and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.380" end="01:07:45.579" style="s2">we have kind of a science fair kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:48.369" style="s2">approach after that where everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.579" end="01:07:50.200" style="s2">gets up and grazes around and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.369" end="01:07:52.599" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the night the 45 to 90 days</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.200" end="01:07:54.609" style="s2">kicked off and you&#39;ve got champions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.599" end="01:07:56.380" style="s2">you&#39;ve got those issues and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.609" end="01:07:59.109" style="s2">separate what I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.380" end="01:08:01.060" style="s2">separate event and a separate function</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.109" end="01:08:03.010" style="s2">there&#39;s dialogue then there&#39;s deciding</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.060" end="01:08:04.569" style="s2">in action and okay then I&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.010" end="01:08:04.780" style="s2">the next meeting what does that look</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.569" end="01:08:07.349" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.780" end="01:08:10.690" style="s2">yeah so you mean like after the</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.349" end="01:08:13.510" style="s2">experimental period has passed yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.690" end="01:08:15.790" style="s2">what that looks like is here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.510" end="01:08:18.819" style="s2">happens there okay we talk about people</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.790" end="01:08:20.589" style="s2">gaming the meeting right that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.819" end="01:08:22.449" style="s2">a form of self management and self</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.589" end="01:08:25.060" style="s2">organization when people learn about</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.449" end="01:08:28.779" style="s2">this open space meeting format and they</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.060" end="01:08:30.759" style="s2">learn that it&#39;s really open what they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.779" end="01:08:31.969" style="s2">tend to do is conspire with their</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.759" end="01:08:33.830" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.969" end="01:08:36.890" style="s2">to move the second meeting in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.830" end="01:08:37.910" style="s2">direction that they want it to go so the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.890" end="01:08:40.910" style="s2">second meaning is up like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.910" end="01:08:43.370" style="s2">retrospective and a prospective it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.910" end="01:08:44.930" style="s2">retrospective on the past 90 days what</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.370" end="01:08:47.600" style="s2">worked what didn&#39;t work what do we want</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.930" end="01:08:49.640" style="s2">to change and it&#39;s also a prospective on</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.600" end="01:08:51.620" style="s2">what&#39;s the next chapter look like and</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.640" end="01:08:54.859" style="s2">and what are the next set of experiments</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.620" end="01:08:56.509" style="s2">that we want to do so what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.859" end="01:08:59.690" style="s2">the real passionate and responsible</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.509" end="01:09:01.609" style="s2">people they will tend to talk to each</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.690" end="01:09:03.799" style="s2">other and start to sort of strategize</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.609" end="01:09:07.100" style="s2">and plan how they&#39;re going to play the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.799" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">second meeting and that&#39;s when it gets</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.100" end="01:09:11.440" style="s2">really interesting so I was in one</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:13.759" style="s2">company where the scrum masters</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.440" end="01:09:17.049" style="s2">conspired around getting a product</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.759" end="01:09:20.569" style="s2">roadmap out of the second meeting and</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.049" end="01:09:23.810" style="s2">the product guy was not the least bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.569" end="01:09:26.270" style="s2">interested in that and within about a</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.810" end="01:09:28.850" style="s2">month and a half that guy was gone he</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.270" end="01:09:31.339" style="s2">quit because after the second meeting</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.850" end="01:09:32.870" style="s2">what was in the Proceedings was we want</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.339" end="01:09:36.410" style="s2">a roadmap that looks at at least 90 days</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.870" end="01:09:38.540" style="s2">190 180 days would be better and they</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.410" end="01:09:39.830" style="s2">went to him and he&#39;s like no I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.540" end="01:09:41.989" style="s2">think we&#39;re gonna be doing any of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.830" end="01:09:44.270" style="s2">and then they went to his boss who was</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.989" end="01:09:47.089" style="s2">the general manager and we got that</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.270" end="01:09:50.089" style="s2">meeting and those as those scrum masters</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.089" end="01:09:52.310" style="s2">facilitated a half a day or almost full</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.089" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">day meeting product roadmapping session</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.310" end="01:09:57.800" style="s2">where they got that roadmap and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:10:00.650" style="s2">deauthorized this product guy and it</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.800" end="01:10:03.530" style="s2">wasn&#39;t too long after that that he quit</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.650" end="01:10:06.040" style="s2">and then progress that that company</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.530" end="01:10:08.180" style="s2">really escalated because he was blocking</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.040" end="01:10:11.060" style="s2">so these are the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.180" end="01:10:13.310" style="s2">happen in these in these meetings yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.060" end="01:10:15.290" style="s2">very cool well I think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.310" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">we&#39;ll transition away from your first</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.290" end="01:10:19.460" style="s2">book to one of your other books I picked</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">two of them to read the second one is</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.460" end="01:10:23.390" style="s2">called inviting leadership and again</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:25.340" style="s2">there&#39;ll be a link to it on our episode</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.390" end="01:10:26.840" style="s2">page at Jim Rutte show com</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.340" end="01:10:29.239" style="s2">why don&#39;t you talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.840" end="01:10:30.980" style="s2">this idea of inviting leadership I</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.239" end="01:10:34.070" style="s2">actually found it quite intriguing might</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.980" end="01:10:37.460" style="s2">be nice just to introduce it sir yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.070" end="01:10:40.090" style="s2">the idea here Jim is that you&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.460" end="01:10:43.880" style="s2">era of full employment in an era of</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.090" end="01:10:44.650" style="s2">mobility and an era of change your best</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.880" end="01:10:47.290" style="s2">work or</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.650" end="01:10:51.100" style="s2">are at-will employees they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.290" end="01:10:54.330" style="s2">volunteers so if you&#39;re not mixing in</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.100" end="01:10:56.650" style="s2">some invitations with those delegations</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.330" end="01:10:59.230" style="s2">you might be losing some of your best</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.650" end="01:11:02.470" style="s2">people because they have a strong drive</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.230" end="01:11:05.410" style="s2">for autonomy and the idea here is</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.470" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">especially in times of rapid change you</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.410" end="01:11:10.570" style="s2">need feedback so delegations do not</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">generate even 1/10 of the feedback than</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.570" end="01:11:17.230" style="s2">an invitation generates so for example</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:20.980" style="s2">you invited me onto the shelf right</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.230" end="01:11:24.400" style="s2">alright and what happened next I got to</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.980" end="01:11:27.250" style="s2">choose the timing of my response the</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.400" end="01:11:30.040" style="s2">medium of my response the content of my</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.250" end="01:11:33.730" style="s2">response and so many other things around</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.040" end="01:11:35.890" style="s2">you know my responding to your send of</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.730" end="01:11:39.250" style="s2">that invitation and that&#39;s all rich</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.890" end="01:11:41.170" style="s2">feedback for you to act on about just</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.250" end="01:11:45.130" style="s2">how good or not good this interview</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.170" end="01:11:46.810" style="s2">might go right so with delegations you</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.130" end="01:11:49.450" style="s2">don&#39;t get any of that feedback and in</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.810" end="01:11:51.730" style="s2">good agile and good scrum good empirical</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.450" end="01:11:55.030" style="s2">process runs on feedback without</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.730" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">feedback you have nothing so the idea</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.030" end="01:11:59.260" style="s2">here is yeah continue to delegate but</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:01.260" style="s2">make some invitations in with your</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.260" end="01:12:04.810" style="s2">delegations because here&#39;s why because</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.260" end="01:12:08.950" style="s2">every invitation has inside of it an</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.810" end="01:12:11.800" style="s2">invitation to decide yes or no and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.950" end="01:12:14.320" style="s2">it turns out that decisions generate</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.800" end="01:12:17.230" style="s2">mindshare and the siding is highly</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.320" end="01:12:19.690" style="s2">engaging you know so when you invited me</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.230" end="01:12:21.820" style="s2">here&#39;s what goes through our mind what</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.690" end="01:12:24.070" style="s2">happens if I say no what happens if I</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.820" end="01:12:26.590" style="s2">say yes what will I miss if I say no</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.070" end="01:12:28.840" style="s2">what will I experience if I say yes all</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.590" end="01:12:31.180" style="s2">those things are in my head so when you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.840" end="01:12:34.110" style="s2">invite me you get in my head this is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.180" end="01:12:37.810" style="s2">very very strong way to lead today</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.110" end="01:12:41.410" style="s2">especially when you want to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.810" end="01:12:44.350" style="s2">respond to change responding to change</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.410" end="01:12:46.510" style="s2">is about feedback so</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.350" end="01:12:49.060" style="s2">invitations generate that feedback they</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.510" end="01:12:51.040" style="s2">they engage here your best workers the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.060" end="01:12:53.230" style="s2">ones with options the ones who will</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.040" end="01:12:55.810" style="s2">loiter at the exits with their resume if</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.230" end="01:12:58.090" style="s2">they smell that smell could you give a</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.810" end="01:13:00.250" style="s2">nice tangible example of where</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.090" end="01:13:02.679" style="s2">a manager might want to choose to use an</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.250" end="01:13:06.460" style="s2">invitation rather than a delegation yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.679" end="01:13:09.040" style="s2">let&#39;s take an example where let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.460" end="01:13:11.080" style="s2">that product owner example you know you</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.040" end="01:13:13.030" style="s2">asked me earlier you know how do you</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.080" end="01:13:15.659" style="s2">select a good product owner but my</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.030" end="01:13:17.739" style="s2">approach would be to find the role</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.659" end="01:13:20.550" style="s2">identify people who could fit in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.739" end="01:13:22.570" style="s2">role and then if there&#39;s three or four</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.550" end="01:13:24.730" style="s2">opportunities to play the product on a</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.570" end="01:13:26.739" style="s2">roll and invite 12 people and let them</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.730" end="01:13:29.110" style="s2">know you know the first four who respond</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.739" end="01:13:30.639" style="s2">to this they have the job and see what</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.110" end="01:13:33.670" style="s2">happens now you&#39;re going to get super</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.639" end="01:13:37.030" style="s2">enthusiastic all the way in 100% in</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.670" end="01:13:39.610" style="s2">product owners instead of foot-dragging</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.030" end="01:13:41.469" style="s2">pissy half-hearted product owners well</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.610" end="01:13:42.670" style="s2">we should increase the chances of it I</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.469" end="01:13:44.949" style="s2">don&#39;t think any of these things are</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.670" end="01:13:46.119" style="s2">panacea is no but I can see that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.949" end="01:13:48.520" style="s2">would be interesting your concept here</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.119" end="01:13:50.409" style="s2">dig into it is that putting a decision</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.520" end="01:13:52.090" style="s2">into the head of the person who may or</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.409" end="01:13:54.070" style="s2">may not do the work is it actually an</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.090" end="01:13:56.770" style="s2">important way to generate information</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.070" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">right in this case it is you can figure</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.770" end="01:14:01.449" style="s2">out who is interested in this role and</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:02.739" style="s2">who&#39;s not rather than saying sue you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.449" end="01:14:04.330" style="s2">look like the right person to be the</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.739" end="01:14:05.710" style="s2">product owner she may not want to be a</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.330" end="01:14:07.750" style="s2">product owner but she might feel</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.710" end="01:14:09.580" style="s2">compelled to say yes yeah and I could</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.750" end="01:14:11.170" style="s2">give you another tangible example of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.580" end="01:14:13.420" style="s2">something that I did in the 90s and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.170" end="01:14:16.150" style="s2">90s they had a technical services firm</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.420" end="01:14:17.590" style="s2">and it grew at about 55 people and I had</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.150" end="01:14:21.610" style="s2">operations in three states</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.590" end="01:14:24.280" style="s2">I created a benefit which was a books</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.610" end="01:14:27.940" style="s2">tippin&#39;s right people could spend 500</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.280" end="01:14:30.909" style="s2">bucks a year on books and here was a</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.940" end="01:14:34.300" style="s2">rule the rule was the book has to</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.909" end="01:14:38.139" style="s2">pertain to your job quote in some way</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.300" end="01:14:39.760" style="s2">and then it was user to lose it and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.139" end="01:14:41.340" style="s2">it reset every year in January those</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.760" end="01:14:43.690" style="s2">were the rules and the constraints and</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.340" end="01:14:44.500" style="s2">everyone was invited to just take</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.690" end="01:14:46.570" style="s2">advantage of it</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.500" end="01:14:48.730" style="s2">well don&#39;t you know how much feedback I</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.570" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">got out of that Jim right so a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.730" end="01:14:52.750" style="s2">people who are working like in.net they</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:54.550" style="s2">were buying java books I had no idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.750" end="01:14:56.139" style="s2">they were interested in Java stuff so I</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.550" end="01:14:57.400" style="s2">got to talk with them and I found out</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.139" end="01:15:00.940" style="s2">that they were real passionate about</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.400" end="01:15:03.250" style="s2">Java and I was able to move some things</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.940" end="01:15:06.010" style="s2">around and really really keep people</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.250" end="01:15:09.070" style="s2">engaged and motivated I got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.010" end="01:15:10.599" style="s2">data from what books they bought when</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.070" end="01:15:11.980" style="s2">they bought them whether they used up</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.599" end="01:15:13.989" style="s2">all the stip and what</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.980" end="01:15:17.110" style="s2">what you know what they were reading</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.989" end="01:15:18.760" style="s2">what they were interested in and and</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.110" end="01:15:20.860" style="s2">that&#39;s another example of generating</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.760" end="01:15:23.230" style="s2">feedback often it off of an invitation</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.860" end="01:15:24.730" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s a good one what else</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.230" end="01:15:26.830" style="s2">can we talk about here what you talked</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.730" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">about the core principles of inviting</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.830" end="01:15:31.960" style="s2">leadership could you go into those yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:33.940" style="s2">there&#39;s four things in common with any</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.960" end="01:15:36.370" style="s2">good game and any good invitation right</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.940" end="01:15:39.190" style="s2">so Jane McGonigal when a book called</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.370" end="01:15:41.860" style="s2">reality is broken about I don&#39;t know ten</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.190" end="01:15:43.870" style="s2">years ago and on page 22 of that book</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.860" end="01:15:46.300" style="s2">she defines the properties of a good</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.870" end="01:15:49.770" style="s2">game in this four of them and I really</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.300" end="01:15:53.950" style="s2">love her definition she says a good game</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.770" end="01:15:57.239" style="s2">has a very clear goal second thing it</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.950" end="01:16:00.160" style="s2">has is very clear rules or constraints</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.239" end="01:16:01.960" style="s2">third thing it has is a way to clearly</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.160" end="01:16:04.960" style="s2">track your progress to know what level</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.960" end="01:16:06.850" style="s2">you&#39;re at and to get feedback and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.960" end="01:16:11.440" style="s2">fourth property and the most important</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.850" end="01:16:13.510" style="s2">one is opt-in participation so it turns</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.440" end="01:16:16.570" style="s2">out that these four properties also</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:18.670" style="s2">apply to any good invitation any good</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.570" end="01:16:20.890" style="s2">invitation has has these four properties</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.670" end="01:16:22.510" style="s2">clearly defined so in the book what I</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.890" end="01:16:24.700" style="s2">described is that there&#39;s some real</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.510" end="01:16:27.700" style="s2">rigor and discipline that has to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.700" end="01:16:29.739" style="s2">applied to your invitations in fact you</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.700" end="01:16:31.120" style="s2">can&#39;t just casually invite someone you</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.739" end="01:16:32.200" style="s2">have to really think about it and</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.120" end="01:16:34.540" style="s2">structure it properly</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.200" end="01:16:37.930" style="s2">unlike delegations which you can just</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.540" end="01:16:40.060" style="s2">throw at people you know so it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.930" end="01:16:42.280" style="s2">clinical but it&#39;s it&#39;s actually very</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.060" end="01:16:44.200" style="s2">simple right like you know I can invite</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.280" end="01:16:46.690" style="s2">you to dinner now and I could I could</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.200" end="01:16:48.280" style="s2">satisfy all four of these properties you</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.690" end="01:16:50.130" style="s2">want me to take a shot at that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.280" end="01:16:52.630" style="s2">actually want to use the example of</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.130" end="01:16:55.300" style="s2">inviting some people who might be</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.630" end="01:16:57.520" style="s2">candidates to be product owners because</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.300" end="01:17:00.550" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit more business yeah</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.520" end="01:17:02.770" style="s2">yeah so here&#39;s how it would go let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.550" end="01:17:04.420" style="s2">that I was reciting you know an email</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.770" end="01:17:07.000" style="s2">that I can post and I was reading it now</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.420" end="01:17:08.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna put it out too so all the</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.000" end="01:17:10.510" style="s2">candidates that we believe would be good</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.620" end="01:17:11.830" style="s2">product owners maybe it&#39;s 20 people all</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.510" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">right that&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.830" end="01:17:15.670" style="s2">wait on preamble you know discuss the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:17.140" style="s2">the need the opportunity and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.670" end="01:17:19.690" style="s2">challenges we face and why we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.140" end="01:17:21.760" style="s2">to scrub and then would say you&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="01:19:03.999" end="01:19:07.960" style="s2">as we get into the book a little further</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.590" end="01:19:09.579" style="s2">you start off by talking about Authority</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.960" end="01:19:11.289" style="s2">yeah give me your view of Authority I</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.579" end="01:19:13.059" style="s2">have my own views I&#39;d love to hear you</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.289" end="01:19:14.679" style="s2">have you articulate from the book or</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.059" end="01:19:15.849" style="s2">since then the books a little old and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.679" end="01:19:17.650" style="s2">then we can talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.849" end="01:19:20.849" style="s2">Authority and how one should think about</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.650" end="01:19:23.499" style="s2">it yeah so authorities a triggering term</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.849" end="01:19:25.119" style="s2">when we go into an organization you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.499" end="01:19:26.499" style="s2">and we&#39;re being introduced around after</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.119" end="01:19:28.659" style="s2">you meet the person or when you meet the</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.499" end="01:19:31.360" style="s2">person the you know the introducer will</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.659" end="01:19:33.579" style="s2">always say oh you know Mary runs</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.360" end="01:19:35.800" style="s2">products or marrying ports the so-and-so</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.579" end="01:19:37.400" style="s2">and quality you know so you know like</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.800" end="01:19:40.640" style="s2">where they are and what their authority</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.400" end="01:19:43.790" style="s2">less in the book we define authority as</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.640" end="01:19:45.830" style="s2">the right to do a specific kind of work</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.790" end="01:19:48.679" style="s2">and some of the most important work you</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.830" end="01:19:52.070" style="s2">could possibly do is making decisions</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.679" end="01:19:54.800" style="s2">that affect the group as a whole if</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.070" end="01:19:58.040" style="s2">you&#39;re authorized to do that we call you</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.800" end="01:19:59.750" style="s2">a leader if you you know participate in</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.040" end="01:20:02.449" style="s2">decisions that affect the group but the</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.750" end="01:20:04.730" style="s2">definition of authority in the book is</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.449" end="01:20:08.690" style="s2">the right to do a specific kind of work</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.730" end="01:20:13.250" style="s2">and then we go on to define power as the</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.690" end="01:20:15.560" style="s2">exercise of authority so Authority is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.250" end="01:20:18.230" style="s2">really deep topic and I&#39;m pulling this</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.560" end="01:20:20.770" style="s2">from the group relations community</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.230" end="01:20:23.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a worldwide community that</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.770" end="01:20:28.030" style="s2">studies and implements the work of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.510" end="01:20:30.350" style="s2">fellow named Alfred beyond the IO n and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.030" end="01:20:32.630" style="s2">they run these conferences in our</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.350" end="01:20:36.890" style="s2">empirical where we study authority in</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.630" end="01:20:38.510" style="s2">the here and now and they create a</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.890" end="01:20:40.520" style="s2">temporary institution in these</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.510" end="01:20:43.310" style="s2">conferences where we explore and play</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.520" end="01:20:46.850" style="s2">with Authority in a safe kind of a space</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.310" end="01:20:48.590" style="s2">away from work and I&#39;ve attended several</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.850" end="01:20:51.949" style="s2">of these and the people that I&#39;ve met</p>

<p begin="01:21:10.699" end="01:21:15.770" style="s2">the book right so you could think of</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.310" end="01:21:19.190" style="s2">authority as the essential information</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.770" end="01:21:21.020" style="s2">that describes the group so if I want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.190" end="01:21:24.199" style="s2">know the group all I need to know is who</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.020" end="01:21:26.840" style="s2">has decision rights that&#39;s gonna form</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.199" end="01:21:29.390" style="s2">the structure so in the book what we say</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.840" end="01:21:31.070" style="s2">is if you want to change culture all you</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.390" end="01:21:32.719" style="s2">need to do is change who&#39;s authorized to</p>

<p begin="01:21:32.719" end="01:21:36.469" style="s2">right away let me hop in here this was</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.489" end="01:21:39.170" style="s2">something we believed in a lot at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.469" end="01:21:42.260" style="s2">Thompson corporation I remember once at</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.170" end="01:21:44.390" style="s2">the we used to have these annual top</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.260" end="01:21:46.730" style="s2">management meetings like 150 people</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.390" end="01:21:49.429" style="s2">something like that and remember as part</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.730" end="01:21:50.929" style="s2">of my keynote address I said here is one</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.429" end="01:21:52.909" style="s2">of our unfair advantages</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.929" end="01:21:54.439" style="s2">against our competition in the Thompson</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.909" end="01:21:56.559" style="s2">corporation which like about an eight</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.439" end="01:22:00.320" style="s2">billion dollar company 50,000 employees</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.559" end="01:22:03.289" style="s2">we have 500 people who are authorized to</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.320" end="01:22:04.999" style="s2">waste fifty thousand dollars beautiful I</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.289" end="01:22:06.889" style="s2">looked over at the CFO and watched him</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.999" end="01:22:08.389" style="s2">cringe but then also smile because he</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.889" end="01:22:08.989" style="s2">knew it was true our number one</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.389" end="01:22:11.630" style="s2">competitor</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.989" end="01:22:13.849" style="s2">mcgraw-hill we know there are three</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.630" end="01:22:16.699" style="s2">people who are allowed to waste fifty</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.849" end="01:22:18.439" style="s2">thousand dollars and I assert that this</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.699" end="01:22:21.920" style="s2">is one of our great competitive</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.439" end="01:22:24.260" style="s2">advantage they are mantra at Thompson</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.920" end="01:22:26.179" style="s2">was we delegate authority down to the</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.260" end="01:22:31.579" style="s2">level were comfortable with and then one</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.179" end="01:22:34.039" style="s2">level below that nice I should say this</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.579" end="01:22:36.530" style="s2">was Thompson in its heyday in the 90s</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.039" end="01:22:38.090" style="s2">they brought in the usual corporate</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.530" end="01:22:40.280" style="s2">clowns in the next generation of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.090" end="01:22:42.320" style="s2">management and it ain&#39;t that no more but</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.280" end="01:22:44.749" style="s2">man did we do some amazing things with</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.320" end="01:22:46.789" style="s2">that design of pushing authority down</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.749" end="01:22:49.070" style="s2">and of course if you push Authority down</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.789" end="01:22:51.439" style="s2">you have to put accountability down so</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.070" end="01:22:52.969" style="s2">in both in Thompson it was well-known</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.439" end="01:22:54.860" style="s2">you missed your numbers two years in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.969" end="01:22:58.010" style="s2">row and your head will definitely get</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.860" end="01:22:59.900" style="s2">lopped off oh well all right you had all</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.010" end="01:23:02.719" style="s2">the authority right and if you it</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.900" end="01:23:04.519" style="s2">up it&#39;s on you exactly you had danger</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.719" end="01:23:07.309" style="s2">and you had opportunity all in one spot</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.519" end="01:23:09.079" style="s2">right yeah we had 25 year old guys or I</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.309" end="01:23:10.880" style="s2">do or a four years out of college who</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.079" end="01:23:12.949" style="s2">you know we&#39;re running a five million</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.880" end="01:23:15.769" style="s2">dollar business unit they had amazing</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.949" end="01:23:17.689" style="s2">Authority and accountability right so</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.769" end="01:23:19.309" style="s2">authority authority to do what its</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.689" end="01:23:22.789" style="s2">authority to decide in this case</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.309" end="01:23:25.249" style="s2">authority to hire and fire design their</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.249" end="01:23:29.749" style="s2">within the you know very broad</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.429" end="01:23:32.059" style="s2">flexibility to spend their budget how</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.749" end="01:23:33.800" style="s2">they want yeah so authority to decide</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.059" end="01:23:36.170" style="s2">when its authority to the edge here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.800" end="01:23:39.769" style="s2">what happens your company becomes more</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.170" end="01:23:41.989" style="s2">responsive to the ever-changing range of</p>

<p begin="01:23:41.989" end="01:23:46.340" style="s2">you know as things change if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.780" end="01:23:48.979" style="s2">centralize control centralized</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.340" end="01:23:51.289" style="s2">decision-making authority then you get</p>

<p begin="01:23:51.289" end="01:23:57.409" style="s2">line I will say that this is goes into</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.429" end="01:23:59.119" style="s2">evolutionary theory that in a business</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.409" end="01:24:01.610" style="s2">space or any kind of competitive space</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.119" end="01:24:04.170" style="s2">there are Fitness landscapes that are</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.660" end="01:24:19.590" style="s2">much but you really need to optimize or</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.490" end="01:24:21.660" style="s2">what they call an evolution exploit you</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.590" end="01:24:23.940" style="s2">need to exploit the space make better</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.660" end="01:24:25.230" style="s2">pins for less money on the other hand if</p>

<p begin="01:24:27.510" end="01:24:32.190" style="s2">Thompson well at least a few of us knew</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.610" end="01:24:34.830" style="s2">damn well that AC a revolutionary sea</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.190" end="01:24:36.810" style="s2">change was about to happen in 1992</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.830" end="01:24:39.750" style="s2">Thompson got 90% of its revenue from</p>

<p begin="01:24:43.050" end="01:24:47.820" style="s2">and so this was gonna be a very rapid</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.300" end="01:24:50.070" style="s2">changing environment and he who was most</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.820" end="01:24:52.920" style="s2">he or she who was most adaptive on this</p>

<p begin="01:24:52.920" end="01:24:56.670" style="s2">is going to be the winners we basically</p>

<p begin="01:25:12.810" end="01:25:18.780" style="s2">at that time isn&#39;t that interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.940" end="01:25:21.090" style="s2">you&#39;re mentioning that this idea of you</p>

<p begin="01:26:11.910" end="01:26:16.890" style="s2">and they can actually respond because</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.280" end="01:26:17.699" style="s2">they have the ability to decide so this</p>

<p begin="01:27:21.659" end="01:27:25.139" style="s2">the conditions where the authorized</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.670" end="01:27:28.260" style="s2">decision rights are in the right place</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.139" end="01:27:31.619" style="s2">so that impediments to good product high</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.260" end="01:27:35.190" style="s2">quality product reliable predictable</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.619" end="01:27:38.429" style="s2">product delivery are removed the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.190" end="01:27:40.739" style="s2">impediment to delivery is the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.429" end="01:27:44.280" style="s2">making decisions that&#39;s what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.739" end="01:27:45.659" style="s2">going on around the world so we we make</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.280" end="01:27:47.639" style="s2">decisions a certain way the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.659" end="01:27:49.650" style="s2">changes we keep making decisions that</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.639" end="01:27:53.300" style="s2">way now there&#39;s an impediment to</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.650" end="01:27:55.380" style="s2">throughput right so this whole idea of</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.300" end="01:27:58.769" style="s2">authorized decision rights and</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.380" end="01:28:01.079" style="s2">continuously refactoring that so that</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.769" end="01:28:02.699" style="s2">the impediments to good product and all</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.079" end="01:28:04.590" style="s2">the things we say we want the goals were</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.699" end="01:28:06.119" style="s2">trying to see those that those</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.590" end="01:28:09.239" style="s2">impediments are minimized or even</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.119" end="01:28:11.070" style="s2">completely removed because my hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.239" end="01:28:14.130" style="s2">and the thing that I coach executives on</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.070" end="01:28:16.860" style="s2">is that the way decisions are being made</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.130" end="01:28:19.729" style="s2">in the organization is actually the</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.860" end="01:28:22.199" style="s2">place where all the problems are</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.729" end="01:28:23.519" style="s2">absolutely and in fact I go a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.199" end="01:28:25.679" style="s2">further which I&#39;ll say what is an</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.519" end="01:28:29.639" style="s2">organization but a signal processing</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.679" end="01:28:31.510" style="s2">system whose output is decisions exactly</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.639" end="01:28:33.670" style="s2">that isn&#39;t that so true so</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.510" end="01:28:35.800" style="s2">so the book inviting leadership</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.670" end="01:28:38.679" style="s2">basically offers the assertion in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.800" end="01:28:41.650" style="s2">hypothesis that if you distribute</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.679" end="01:28:43.929" style="s2">decision rights which is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.650" end="01:28:45.969" style="s2">actually doing with imitation that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.929" end="01:28:48.840" style="s2">become a more responsive organization in</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.969" end="01:28:51.639" style="s2">a time of you know high magnitude change</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.840" end="01:28:54.280" style="s2">technology these I was listening to the</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.639" end="01:28:57.730" style="s2">Apple financial results for the quarter</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.280" end="01:29:01.030" style="s2">there&#39;s 1.3 billion Apple devices out</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.730" end="01:29:03.670" style="s2">there now this is totally transforming</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.030" end="01:29:05.829" style="s2">society I was saying to my wife Roberta</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.670" end="01:29:09.309" style="s2">that it&#39;s not changing the fabric of</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.829" end="01:29:11.860" style="s2">society the technology is the fabric so</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.309" end="01:29:13.630" style="s2">what&#39;s happening here is the pace of</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.860" end="01:29:16.119" style="s2">change is speeding up it&#39;s hitting</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.630" end="01:29:17.349" style="s2">businesses first they&#39;re stuck in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.119" end="01:29:18.880" style="s2">mud in the way that they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.349" end="01:29:21.280" style="s2">decisions and they can&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.880" end="01:29:23.710" style="s2">their own way and these companies are</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.280" end="01:29:26.530" style="s2">going to get acquired they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.710" end="01:29:28.659" style="s2">run over by by fast-moving nimble</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.530" end="01:29:30.849" style="s2">competitors smaller ones startups with</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.659" end="01:29:32.409" style="s2">nothing to lose and this is this is what</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.849" end="01:29:34.090" style="s2">we&#39;re up against so in inviting</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.409" end="01:29:36.429" style="s2">leadership what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.090" end="01:29:38.230" style="s2">actually taking an empirical approach to</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.429" end="01:29:40.510" style="s2">leadership that&#39;s what the books all</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.230" end="01:29:41.619" style="s2">about let me add one light final tuning</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.510" end="01:29:43.719" style="s2">and then we&#39;re gonna have to wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.619" end="01:29:46.659" style="s2">here we&#39;re about at our time which is I</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.719" end="01:29:48.610" style="s2">would extend the authority with a little</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.659" end="01:29:50.920" style="s2">cloud around it of signaling and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.610" end="01:29:52.840" style="s2">gonna give you a real live example one</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.920" end="01:29:54.489" style="s2">of my collection of businesses I was in</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.840" end="01:29:56.679" style="s2">charge of and I was at Thompson I was a</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.489" end="01:29:58.960" style="s2">group CEO or whatever the hell that is</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.679" end="01:30:00.250" style="s2">and one of my businesses was one that</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.960" end="01:30:03.340" style="s2">would periodically have serious problems</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.250" end="01:30:04.869" style="s2">on short timeframe and we had pushed a</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.340" end="01:30:07.480" style="s2">lot of authority down to the head of</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.869" end="01:30:08.949" style="s2">that business unit as would be usual but</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.480" end="01:30:10.960" style="s2">because of the nature of the business</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.949" end="01:30:13.179" style="s2">there could be things that were beyond a</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.960" end="01:30:16.059" style="s2">reasonable amount of scope to push down</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.179" end="01:30:18.670" style="s2">to a 27 year old guy and so I told him</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.059" end="01:30:20.320" style="s2">Chris should there ever be and hire and</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.670" end="01:30:22.210" style="s2">I was a busy son-of-a-bitch in those</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.320" end="01:30:24.280" style="s2">days I made up my time was scheduled in</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.210" end="01:30:26.050" style="s2">15 minute blocks and it was just nuts</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.280" end="01:30:28.809" style="s2">but anyway I always told him Chris</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.050" end="01:30:31.539" style="s2">there&#39;s this decision that is above your</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.809" end="01:30:33.219" style="s2">large but not infinite delegation of</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.539" end="01:30:36.809" style="s2">authority and you need me to make it</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.219" end="01:30:39.699" style="s2">right now come and stand on my desk</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.809" end="01:30:41.920" style="s2">beautiful and even if I&#39;m in the middle</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.699" end="01:30:44.019" style="s2">of a meeting he was a very athletic guy</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.920" end="01:30:44.800" style="s2">like a former wrestler I think anyway</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.019" end="01:30:47.560" style="s2">one time</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.800" end="01:30:49.540" style="s2">he actually did that and sure his</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.560" end="01:30:51.220" style="s2">it was a mission-critical</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.540" end="01:30:52.930" style="s2">decision that had to be made like in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.220" end="01:30:55.330" style="s2">next three hours or there would be large</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.930" end="01:30:57.310" style="s2">consequences and so he appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.330" end="01:30:59.350" style="s2">used singling to extend his own</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.310" end="01:31:01.570" style="s2">authority no isn&#39;t that interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.350" end="01:31:03.400" style="s2">you you defined a protocol exactly</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.570" end="01:31:04.900" style="s2">literally it&#39;s a protocol it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.400" end="01:31:07.150" style="s2">protocol that&#39;s what you actually did</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.900" end="01:31:10.330" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a structured interaction</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.150" end="01:31:15.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a very very high-functioning kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.330" end="01:31:16.900" style="s2">of behavior so that signals symbols and</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.010" end="01:31:18.730" style="s2">signage right there&#39;s a whole science</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.900" end="01:31:21.430" style="s2">around this called semiotic Jim right</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.730" end="01:31:24.460" style="s2">yeah purse right famous Percy and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.430" end="01:31:27.940" style="s2">theories of semiotics exactly so so a</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.460" end="01:31:30.550" style="s2">subset of this is is biosemiotics that</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.940" end="01:31:33.300" style="s2">is you know this is a signaling ensign</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.550" end="01:31:36.070" style="s2">engines in symbolic aspects of</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.300" end="01:31:38.710" style="s2">biological systems right in the inviting</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.070" end="01:31:40.590" style="s2">leadership book we introduced a further</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.710" end="01:31:43.240" style="s2">subset of semiotic which we call</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.590" end="01:31:45.130" style="s2">leadership semiotic sand that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.240" end="01:31:47.470" style="s2">the story that you just told was the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.130" end="01:31:49.860" style="s2">story about leadership semiotic so so</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.470" end="01:31:52.600" style="s2">leaders can think of themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.860" end="01:31:54.310" style="s2">signaling devices in the in the social</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.600" end="01:31:57.520" style="s2">system right so when we go down the</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.310" end="01:32:00.460" style="s2">highway driving we use signage and</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.520" end="01:32:02.410" style="s2">symbols and signals to keep ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.460" end="01:32:04.030" style="s2">safe right we use the signs along the</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.410" end="01:32:06.220" style="s2">road to find their way and then we</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.030" end="01:32:07.360" style="s2">signal you know to the other vehicles</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.220" end="01:32:09.400" style="s2">that are moving you know what our</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.360" end="01:32:11.980" style="s2">intentions are so we signal our intent</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.400" end="01:32:14.140" style="s2">through directional signaling this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.980" end="01:32:16.150" style="s2">what leaders are doing right so so</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.140" end="01:32:18.300" style="s2">people are listening very carefully to</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.150" end="01:32:21.400" style="s2">what they say and what they do and</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.300" end="01:32:24.070" style="s2">leadership semiotic s-- is actually a</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.400" end="01:32:25.890" style="s2">very big deal cool I didn&#39;t be knowing I</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.070" end="01:32:30.250" style="s2">was no semiotic</p>
