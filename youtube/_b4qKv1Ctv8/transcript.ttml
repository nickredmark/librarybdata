<p begin="00:11:20.880" end="00:11:23.940" style="s2">become friends as well and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:26.430" style="s2">was probably a pretty good call on their</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.940" end="00:11:28.260" style="s2">part I have sat on this episode for</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.430" end="00:11:30.149" style="s2">months however because I was hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.260" end="00:11:31.740" style="s2">I would have a second chance to record</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.149" end="00:11:33.450" style="s2">with Daniel given that he was on very</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">little sleep from the night before this</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.450" end="00:11:38.279" style="s2">discussion was recorded however we now</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:40.290" style="s2">find ourselves in a viral outbreak and</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.279" end="00:11:42.779" style="s2">Daniel is one of the few people I deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.290" end="00:11:44.610" style="s2">with trying to make progress on how</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.779" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">humans can have a permanent future on</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.610" end="00:11:48.329" style="s2">this small and dangerous planet</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.890" style="s2">particularly amidst the fatal</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.329" end="00:11:52.589" style="s2">temptations of nuclear and biological</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.200" end="00:11:58.860" style="s2">now the corona virus may or may not turn</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.860" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">but the problems it poses and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.079" end="00:12:06.570" style="s2">foreshadows are directly within or</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.570" end="00:12:10.290" style="s2">in particular favors the wisdom and</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.290" end="00:12:14.310" style="s2">decision tree a branch that I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.570" end="00:12:16.140" style="s2">probably deserves the second most</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.310" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">attention after my personal favorite</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.140" end="00:12:20.070" style="s2">which is the need for new physics with</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:22.589" style="s2">the possibility of escape to the distant</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.070" end="00:12:24.540" style="s2">cosmos that is Daniel is searching for</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.589" end="00:12:27.089" style="s2">something like the wisdom needed to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.540" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">re-engineer a non rival risk or ante</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.089" end="00:12:33.269" style="s2">rivalry society to live in harmony with</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">its newfound godlike powers sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.269" end="00:12:36.870" style="s2">the search for a so-called escape</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:40.050" style="s2">through wisdom goes under the name of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.870" end="00:12:42.690" style="s2">game B now the idea behind game B is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.050" end="00:12:44.459" style="s2">something like the following natural and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.690" end="00:12:45.370" style="s2">sexual selection must be assumed to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.459" end="00:12:47.529" style="s2">engineered us</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.370" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">for a cycle of competition and misery</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.529" end="00:12:51.790" style="s2">which we might term game a played read</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:12:55.779" style="s2">of tooth and claw under the law of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.790" end="00:12:58.510" style="s2">jungle game B is by contrast a mythical</p>

<p begin="00:12:58.510" end="00:13:03.820" style="s2">built within game a teach themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.450" end="00:13:06.370" style="s2">do something far less brutal rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.820" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">unsustainable and wasteful but without</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.370" end="00:13:11.589" style="s2">themselves getting out competed by those</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:14.020" style="s2">who wish to remain in game a as such</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.589" end="00:13:15.790" style="s2">game B Falls clearly within the confines</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.020" end="00:13:18.730" style="s2">of the so called human potential</p>

<p begin="00:13:20.710" end="00:13:24.700" style="s2">part of it as I fear that it does not</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.330" end="00:13:27.490" style="s2">fully make sense to me the game B is</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.700" end="00:13:29.589" style="s2">really a possibility nevertheless the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.490" end="00:13:31.570" style="s2">quest for a less rival risk world is</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.589" end="00:13:33.400" style="s2">probably a noble one in one of which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.570" end="00:13:36.070" style="s2">at least partially personally supportive</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.400" end="00:13:38.080" style="s2">in any event I thought that this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.070" end="00:13:40.029" style="s2">episode that is probably most in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.080" end="00:13:42.040" style="s2">with the semi apocalyptic mood that many</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.029" end="00:13:44.500" style="s2">of us find ourselves within during these</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.040" end="00:13:46.240" style="s2">days of quarantine I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.500" end="00:13:47.650" style="s2">will be everyone&#39;s cup of tea but I</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.240" end="00:13:49.540" style="s2">think daniel has many interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.650" end="00:13:52.540" style="s2">perspectives and it is a pleasure to</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.540" end="00:13:56.350" style="s2">please sit back and relax as we bring</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.670" end="00:14:06.459" style="s2">you an uninterrupted discussion with</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.459" end="00:14:09.880" style="s2">found the portal I&#39;m your host Eric</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.320" end="00:14:12.459" style="s2">Weinstein and today we&#39;ll be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.880" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">down with a name that will not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.459" end="00:14:16.450" style="s2">familiar to many of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.490" style="s2">my friend daniel trachtenberg Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.450" end="00:14:21.390" style="s2">welcome to the portal thanks for having</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.490" end="00:14:23.980" style="s2">me Eric so Daniel I have to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.390" end="00:14:26.620" style="s2">the way in which I came to know you was</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.980" end="00:14:28.540" style="s2">a little bit odd I would start to talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.620" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">about various ideas and people would</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.540" end="00:14:32.200" style="s2">simply say to me that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">interesting have you ever talked to</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.200" end="00:14:37.800" style="s2">Daniel &#39;shmock did Berger and so far as</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:42.990" style="s2">I knew you weren&#39;t affiliated with any</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.800" end="00:14:47.709" style="s2">famous institution you did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.990" end="00:14:51.459" style="s2">large outreach into the public and yet</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.709" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">somehow my network was very attuned to</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.459" end="00:14:58.300" style="s2">your thinking do you have any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:14:59.130" style="s2">what it was that caused your name among</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.300" end="00:15:02.730" style="s2">all names</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.130" end="00:15:08.010" style="s2">to come up frequently in context that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.730" end="00:15:09.960" style="s2">share well I think we just we do happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.010" end="00:15:12.270" style="s2">to have some good friends in common and</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.960" end="00:15:15.480" style="s2">people who have similar interests in</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.270" end="00:15:17.280" style="s2">terms of how to do better thinking how</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.480" end="00:15:21.810" style="s2">to make civilization better make society</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.280" end="00:15:25.830" style="s2">better concerns about civilization risk</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.810" end="00:15:28.850" style="s2">and probably mostly have friends that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:34.200" style="s2">appreciate heterodox thinking but clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:36.150" style="s2">heterodox thinking and yeah my my goal</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.200" end="00:15:38.070" style="s2">was never a lot of broadcast my goal was</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.150" end="00:15:39.570" style="s2">to communicate with people that I also</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.070" end="00:15:41.730" style="s2">thought were earnestly endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.570" end="00:15:44.790" style="s2">think well and see if we could think</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:47.990" style="s2">better about things and maybe make</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.790" end="00:15:52.320" style="s2">progress on things together well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.990" end="00:15:55.380" style="s2">suppose that the way I view it is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.320" end="00:15:59.370" style="s2">there are very few people at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.380" end="00:16:03.000" style="s2">who are really trying to integrate any</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.370" end="00:16:05.400" style="s2">kind of rigorous thinking across many</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.000" end="00:16:08.190" style="s2">different disciplines to solve what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.400" end="00:16:11.700" style="s2">would think would be society wide</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.190" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">problems and opportunities for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.700" end="00:16:15.300" style="s2">and I find that very surprising because</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.460" style="s2">we keep being told what a prosperous</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.300" end="00:16:19.830" style="s2">society we are and you would think that</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.460" end="00:16:22.230" style="s2">in a prosperous society there would be</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.830" end="00:16:24.540" style="s2">lots of people experimenting with</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.230" end="00:16:27.750" style="s2">radically new ideas about societal</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.540" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">organization at any given time given</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.750" end="00:16:33.590" style="s2">that so much is on the line whenever we</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:37.650" style="s2">talk about climate or multipolar</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.590" end="00:16:39.510" style="s2">geopolitical conflict it seems very</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.650" end="00:16:41.990" style="s2">strange that there are so few people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.510" end="00:16:46.950" style="s2">are interested in what I would think are</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.990" end="00:16:51.960" style="s2">the existential questions for humans do</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.950" end="00:16:54.450" style="s2">you find first of all that you think</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.960" end="00:16:56.700" style="s2">that that our our world in our society</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.450" end="00:17:02.550" style="s2">is thinking properly about where it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.700" end="00:17:04.800" style="s2">and at this point in human history ah no</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.550" end="00:17:08.579" style="s2">I obviously don&#39;t think that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.800" end="00:17:10.829" style="s2">thinking very well about it most any of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.579" end="00:17:12.929" style="s2">the schools</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.829" end="00:17:15.510" style="s2">not the kind of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.929" end="00:17:18.720" style="s2">reactionary not the left not the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.510" end="00:17:22.289" style="s2">not the techno capitalist cingulate</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.720" end="00:17:26.089" style="s2">Aryan optimists I think there is some</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.289" end="00:17:28.830" style="s2">signal and a good bit of noise and also</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.089" end="00:17:31.140" style="s2">not just epistemic bias but epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.830" end="00:17:33.210" style="s2">inadequacy coming from whatever domain</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.140" end="00:17:34.470" style="s2">specialty looking at something that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.210" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">much more complex than any domain</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.470" end="00:17:41.390" style="s2">specialty by itself is going to do a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">good job of I think you speak well to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.390" end="00:17:48.210" style="s2">why there are not more different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:51.960" style="s2">trying to figure things out is you end</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.210" end="00:17:54.539" style="s2">up getting some kind of dominant system</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.960" end="00:17:56.580" style="s2">that is this autopoietic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.539" end="00:17:58.740" style="s2">self-perpetuating and so then it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.580" end="00:18:01.649" style="s2">want to say what what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.740" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">autopoietic yes self-perpetuating self</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.649" end="00:18:07.080" style="s2">authoring and so let&#39;s and when we say</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:08.669" style="s2">system it&#39;s like what system we talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.080" end="00:18:10.860" style="s2">about the academic system are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.669" end="00:18:12.600" style="s2">about the monetary system are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.860" end="00:18:13.889" style="s2">about our government system are we</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.600" end="00:18:14.880" style="s2">talking about culture are we talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.889" end="00:18:17.100" style="s2">about media and information</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.880" end="00:18:20.940" style="s2">communication and it&#39;s yes it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.100" end="00:18:24.840" style="s2">intersection of all those into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.940" end="00:18:26.940" style="s2">civilizational system and that I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.840" end="00:18:29.460" style="s2">can be best thought of if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.940" end="00:18:32.870" style="s2">think of it in simple terms as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.460" end="00:18:35.730" style="s2">system that confers power to things and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.870" end="00:18:37.559" style="s2">so of course everything that supports</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.730" end="00:18:39.090" style="s2">that system gets more power within the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.559" end="00:18:42.990" style="s2">system and everything that would</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.090" end="00:18:45.600" style="s2">possibly threaten the core relevancy or</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.990" end="00:18:46.919" style="s2">validity of the system threatens people</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.600" end="00:18:49.230" style="s2">who are doing well in the system and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.919" end="00:18:52.500" style="s2">it gets kind of spit out by the system</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.230" end="00:18:56.850" style="s2">and so I think that&#39;s a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.500" end="00:18:59.789" style="s2">normative force all right so let me let</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.850" end="00:19:01.500" style="s2">me give a little bit of my frame we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.789" end="00:19:03.630" style="s2">try to pass things back and forth and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.500" end="00:19:05.909" style="s2">feel free to take over if you like but</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.630" end="00:19:07.649" style="s2">here&#39;s what I see that I think of is</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.909" end="00:19:10.380" style="s2">being really interesting and rather</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.649" end="00:19:13.799" style="s2">mysterious I see a decision tree in</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.380" end="00:19:16.190" style="s2">which I think at a society-wide level I</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.799" end="00:19:19.529" style="s2">can&#39;t accept any of the major branches</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.190" end="00:19:21.690" style="s2">so one branch would be that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.529" end="00:19:23.340" style="s2">self-extinguishing human event let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.690" end="00:19:24.300" style="s2">an all-out nuclear war where people</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.340" end="00:19:27.270" style="s2">miscalculate</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.300" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">and the planet is unrecognizable then</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.270" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a different branch that says</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s some sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:35.400" style="s2">environmental collapse maybe with a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.890" style="s2">nuclear exchange or some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.400" end="00:19:40.620" style="s2">synthetic biology who knows what where</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.890" end="00:19:42.840" style="s2">there are survivors but it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.620" end="00:19:44.820" style="s2">not the world that we see at our window</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.840" end="00:19:47.580" style="s2">here then there&#39;s another one which says</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.820" end="00:19:50.370" style="s2">maybe we managed to trundle on for</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.580" end="00:19:53.190" style="s2">another thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.370" end="00:19:55.680" style="s2">somehow limping along without any major</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.190" end="00:19:57.150" style="s2">new ideas we&#39;re still using markets</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.680" end="00:19:59.910" style="s2">things are getting incrementally better</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.150" end="00:20:01.230" style="s2">maybe there some big breakthroughs here</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.910" end="00:20:04.110" style="s2">and there but there&#39;s no big</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.230" end="00:20:06.050" style="s2">breakthrough in human wisdom so that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.110" end="00:20:08.300" style="s2">have the same dangerous objects but we</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.050" end="00:20:10.470" style="s2">continue to be lucky that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.300" end="00:20:12.810" style="s2">weaponize &#39;as these things and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.470" end="00:20:15.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no broad collapse then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.810" end="00:20:17.790" style="s2">an escape branch where we we end up on</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.630" end="00:20:19.680" style="s2">Mars or maybe we escape even farther out</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.790" end="00:20:22.200" style="s2">in the universe or maybe we get uploaded</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.680" end="00:20:24.300" style="s2">into silicon there&#39;s no part of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.200" end="00:20:29.010" style="s2">tree that looks sensible to me every</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.300" end="00:20:31.350" style="s2">single branch is somewhere in sci-fi are</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:32.580" style="s2">you seeing something well it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.350" end="00:20:33.990" style="s2">that or do you have some branches that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:38.280" style="s2">you think are more probable and more</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.990" end="00:20:40.440" style="s2">hopeful more hopeful yes probable no but</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.280" end="00:20:41.940" style="s2">I can&#39;t do a probability calculation</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.440" end="00:20:43.590" style="s2">because they&#39;re unprecedented so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.940" end="00:20:46.770" style="s2">have priors after you have to impute</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.590" end="00:20:48.690" style="s2">yeah so the first two that you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.770" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">existential risk and catastrophic risk</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.690" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">this certainly lots of different ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:54.330" style="s2">for both of those to occur they get that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:56.130" style="s2">are getting increasingly likely I hope</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.330" end="00:21:00.120" style="s2">time goes on as I model it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.130" end="00:21:03.060" style="s2">we should get into that the idea that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.120" end="00:21:04.560" style="s2">continues relatively similar to how it</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.060" end="00:21:07.470" style="s2">is for a thousand years I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.560" end="00:21:10.290" style="s2">possible at all and I can say why I</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.470" end="00:21:12.660" style="s2">think this civilization system is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.290" end="00:21:14.430" style="s2">actually self terminating in a much</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.660" end="00:21:15.930" style="s2">shorter time than that inexorably like</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.430" end="00:21:21.390" style="s2">there is no way that it could continue</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.930" end="00:21:24.510" style="s2">for very long and so the escape models</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.390" end="00:21:27.120" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly dubious of not because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.510" end="00:21:28.500" style="s2">couldn&#39;t with near-term tech get some</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.120" end="00:21:29.910" style="s2">people into space but we certainly</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.500" end="00:21:32.040" style="s2">couldn&#39;t get something that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.910" end="00:21:34.500" style="s2">depend on earth that if we things</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:35.790" style="s2">up here it&#39;s doing well within the time</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.500" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">frames that I think will things up</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.790" end="00:21:39.910" style="s2">on earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:41.080" style="s2">at least the trajectory as I see it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.910" end="00:21:46.960" style="s2">then the question you asked is there</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.080" end="00:21:48.940" style="s2">some other thing like progress to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:50.560" style="s2">totally different type of social system</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.940" end="00:21:53.470" style="s2">here or totally different type of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.560" end="00:21:54.790" style="s2">civilization system that can continue</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.470" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">for a long time that isn&#39;t self</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.790" end="00:21:58.330" style="s2">terminating and it isn&#39;t generating</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:01.660" style="s2">catastrophic and existential risks as</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.330" end="00:22:04.390" style="s2">the byproduct of the architecture of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.660" end="00:22:07.180" style="s2">system itself is really the only path so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.390" end="00:22:09.580" style="s2">you know what I spend most of my time</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.180" end="00:22:12.460" style="s2">working on is what the architectures of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.580" end="00:22:14.710" style="s2">a system like that must be and what the</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.460" end="00:22:16.540" style="s2">transition would look like so I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.710" end="00:22:20.770" style="s2">happy with that description and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.540" end="00:22:23.320" style="s2">also sort of sets up what at least our</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.770" end="00:22:25.420" style="s2">initial superficial division is that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.320" end="00:22:28.900" style="s2">that of the branches of the decision</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.420" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">tree that I can&#39;t accept the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.900" end="00:22:33.430" style="s2">hopeful branch to me is that we learn</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:35.380" style="s2">our source code and use it to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.430" end="00:22:37.810" style="s2">something that it has never been done</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.380" end="00:22:42.420" style="s2">but something that has never been done</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.810" end="00:22:45.910" style="s2">before which is potentially travel</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.420" end="00:22:48.850" style="s2">outside the solar system or potentially</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.910" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">through some as yet unknown physical</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.850" end="00:22:56.500" style="s2">possibility you have an idea about</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">hacking social systems with so far our</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.500" end="00:23:03.970" style="s2">biology the way it is in our structure</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:08.380" style="s2">the way it is in our in our governance</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.970" end="00:23:09.640" style="s2">but somehow delivering us to a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.380" end="00:23:10.930" style="s2">structure I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.640" end="00:23:13.960" style="s2">going to be through human enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.930" end="00:23:17.290" style="s2">through a cultural change through Rhian</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.960" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">scent of izing the world so am i right</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.290" end="00:23:21.300" style="s2">that those those those I I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.690" end="00:23:23.740" style="s2">your branch of the decision tree is very</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.300" end="00:23:25.210" style="s2">interesting I just I&#39;m very pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.740" end="00:23:26.440" style="s2">about it and I think you should be</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.210" end="00:23:28.420" style="s2">pessimistic about mine</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.440" end="00:23:30.310" style="s2">well when you say hacking the source</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.420" end="00:23:31.630" style="s2">code you mean the source code of physics</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.310" end="00:23:33.190" style="s2">so we can get something like a warp</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.630" end="00:23:34.450" style="s2">drive and I&#39;m down right like I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.190" end="00:23:37.240" style="s2">totally work with you on a galactic</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.450" end="00:23:39.940" style="s2">Cruiser if we can do that too that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.240" end="00:23:44.080" style="s2">warp drive but okay the placeholder is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.940" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">placeholder okay I think the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.080" end="00:23:48.160" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about also requires</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:48.820" style="s2">something like understanding source code</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.160" end="00:23:50.710" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.820" end="00:23:54.009" style="s2">front level sure not source code of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.710" end="00:23:55.480" style="s2">physics but source code of things</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.009" end="00:23:57.789" style="s2">related you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.480" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">psychology and evolution and the nature</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.789" end="00:24:02.409" style="s2">of tool-making and the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:06.490" style="s2">collective sense making in choice making</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.409" end="00:24:09.130" style="s2">type dynamics okay and but to start to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.490" end="00:24:11.440" style="s2">go into what it would look like we have</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.130" end="00:24:13.210" style="s2">to do I would have to to have it make</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.679" style="s2">any sense describe what I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.210" end="00:24:16.659" style="s2">problems are why the current system is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.679" end="00:24:18.070" style="s2">self terminating and why all the systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.659" end="00:24:20.590" style="s2">that we have ever had have been self</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.070" end="00:24:22.620" style="s2">terminating because God actually defined</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.590" end="00:24:25.179" style="s2">the problem properly to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.620" end="00:24:26.679" style="s2">because that gives me necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.179" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">sufficient criteria for what an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.679" end="00:24:33.070" style="s2">solution would have to address you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">teeing up my next question which is take</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.070" end="00:24:39.340" style="s2">us through your reasoning as to why we</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">can&#39;t luck out over several hundred</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.340" end="00:24:48.039" style="s2">years and simply kind of bumble on as</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:53.110" style="s2">before okay a couple different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.039" end="00:24:55.509" style="s2">looking at this that all converge if we</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.110" end="00:24:59.740" style="s2">look at the kind of Club of Rome limits</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.509" end="00:25:03.070" style="s2">of growth type model I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.740" end="00:25:05.590" style="s2">is more fundamental than we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.070" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">thinking about so you and Peter were</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.590" end="00:25:09.610" style="s2">talking the other day about the need for</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.610" end="00:25:15.190" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen the inaugural episode of</p>

<p begin="00:25:15.190" end="00:25:19.450" style="s2">ongoing economic growth so that we can</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.450" end="00:25:22.659" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have economic growth and</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.889" end="00:25:25.110" style="s2">people keep wanting more stuff and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.659" end="00:25:28.210" style="s2">goes zero-sum in that creates conflict</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.110" end="00:25:30.190" style="s2">so just to make sure there were I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:25:36.490" end="00:25:42.879" style="s2">yes okay and I think that obviously we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.049" end="00:25:44.830" style="s2">can go positive some and still have it</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.879" end="00:25:46.509" style="s2">all be captured by a few right like not</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.830" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">actually have anything like appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.509" end="00:25:49.779" style="s2">to distribution and we know that wealth</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:51.399" style="s2">has a power-law distribution and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.779" end="00:25:52.509" style="s2">some very fundamental things about why</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.399" end="00:25:53.980" style="s2">it&#39;s always going to have a power-law</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.509" end="00:25:55.539" style="s2">distribution if it has social</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.980" end="00:25:56.740" style="s2">architectures like some currently how</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.539" end="00:25:59.799" style="s2">I&#39;m comfortable with this but by</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.740" end="00:26:01.210" style="s2">power-law distribution we mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.799" end="00:26:05.169" style="s2">the winners</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.210" end="00:26:07.179" style="s2">are so much bigger as winners than let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.169" end="00:26:09.010" style="s2">say a normal probability a normal</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.179" end="00:26:10.630" style="s2">bell-shaped curve right would tell us</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.010" end="00:26:12.220" style="s2">the curve looks like this you have a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.630" end="00:26:15.340" style="s2">people who have almost everything and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.220" end="00:26:17.110" style="s2">most people have quite little and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.340" end="00:26:18.700" style="s2">as you know if we look at like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.110" end="00:26:20.919" style="s2">increase in wealth that has happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.700" end="00:26:22.659" style="s2">since the internet it has not been</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.919" end="00:26:26.230" style="s2">pretty evenly distributed over most of</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.659" end="00:26:28.450" style="s2">the people it&#39;s been you know increasing</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.230" end="00:26:30.279" style="s2">wealth and ability is there a name for</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.450" end="00:26:32.710" style="s2">the pie that&#39;s growing but we&#39;re almost</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.710" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">people&#39;s is shrinking well I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.130" end="00:26:41.559" style="s2">could call it global GDP is one very</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">simplified metric and we can say okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.559" end="00:26:45.730" style="s2">we want global GDP to increase because</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:49.179" style="s2">that represents total goods and services</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.730" end="00:26:50.770" style="s2">that represent some way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.179" end="00:26:52.330" style="s2">about value it&#39;s a really bad way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.770" end="00:27:01.149" style="s2">thinking about value and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.330" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">should discuss that okay if obviously up</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.149" end="00:27:05.710" style="s2">until the Industrial Revolution they</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:09.250" style="s2">were about a half a billion people on</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.710" end="00:27:11.559" style="s2">the planet at most okay and then we go</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.250" end="00:27:17.529" style="s2">as soon as the Industrial ushion and our</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.559" end="00:27:19.210" style="s2">ability to extract resources at faster</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.529" end="00:27:21.850" style="s2">than their reproduction amounts from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.210" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">biosphere we go from half a billion</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.850" end="00:27:27.000" style="s2">people over whatever three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">thousand years of Homo Sapien history to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.000" end="00:27:32.260" style="s2">eight billion people in almost no time</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:36.850" style="s2">at all and so that&#39;s like there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.260" end="00:27:38.649" style="s2">issue there that is we are subsidizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.850" end="00:27:40.690" style="s2">our growth with savings accounts that</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.649" end="00:27:41.770" style="s2">are finite and this a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.690" end="00:27:44.320" style="s2">ways of thinking about that but if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.770" end="00:27:46.330" style="s2">look at biodiversity loss or species</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.320" end="00:27:48.370" style="s2">extinction or growing dead zones in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.330" end="00:27:51.960" style="s2">ocean or any of these issues not just</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.370" end="00:27:55.570" style="s2">climate change we can see that we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.960" end="00:27:58.600" style="s2">we have a linear materials economy that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.570" end="00:28:01.289" style="s2">takes resources from the earth unruhe</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.600" end="00:28:04.330" style="s2">new ibly and produces a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.289" end="00:28:05.770" style="s2">pollution waste heat whatever in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.330" end="00:28:07.450" style="s2">process of manufacturing transportation</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.770" end="00:28:10.870" style="s2">and then turns them into trash on this</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.450" end="00:28:13.029" style="s2">side and so we get both accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.870" end="00:28:14.890" style="s2">dynamics and depletion dynamics and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.029" end="00:28:17.980" style="s2">can&#39;t keep running accumulation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.890" end="00:28:22.420" style="s2">lesion dynamics on a finite biosphere</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.980" end="00:28:25.180" style="s2">indefinitely okay now of course you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.420" end="00:28:27.540" style="s2">the the immediate next argument which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.180" end="00:28:30.250" style="s2">make a closed-loop economy well that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.540" end="00:28:32.200" style="s2">you needed to burn fossil fuels for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.250" end="00:28:33.970" style="s2">period of time in order to become</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.200" end="00:28:35.860" style="s2">wealthy enough to figure out how to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.970" end="00:28:37.930" style="s2">something clean green and sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.860" end="00:28:40.450" style="s2">right and so the idea is that these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.930" end="00:28:42.820" style="s2">really just intermediate phases and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.450" end="00:28:46.540" style="s2">looks pretty dirty and grubby now but in</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.820" end="00:28:48.610" style="s2">fact good news human human ingenuity is</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.540" end="00:28:49.960" style="s2">boundless and so we&#39;ll just think our</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.610" end="00:28:53.980" style="s2">way out of whatever new problems we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.960" end="00:28:55.810" style="s2">created so we can all easily say we</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.980" end="00:28:59.140" style="s2">can&#39;t keep running a linear materials</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.810" end="00:29:00.730" style="s2">economy with exponential growth on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.140" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">planet that&#39;s pretty straightforward and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.730" end="00:29:05.320" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually very near limits of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">our capacity to keep doing that on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.320" end="00:29:10.660" style="s2">bunch of different atomic cycles so then</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:12.340" style="s2">we say okay well we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.660" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">closed-loop where the new stuff that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.340" end="00:29:15.160" style="s2">make comes from the old stuff that old</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.720" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">stuff turns into new stuff and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.160" end="00:29:19.990" style="s2">we&#39;re able to do that closed loop</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:23.380" style="s2">cycling of matter using renewable energy</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.990" end="00:29:25.000" style="s2">and so this is one necessary dynamic but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.380" end="00:29:26.350" style="s2">this already doesn&#39;t look like the model</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.000" end="00:29:28.270" style="s2">that you&#39;re mentioning of society</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.350" end="00:29:29.740" style="s2">hobbling along mostly the same because</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.270" end="00:29:31.690" style="s2">that&#39;s actually really really different</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.740" end="00:29:33.760" style="s2">that would already be a significant</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.690" end="00:29:35.890" style="s2">change not maybe a significant as a warp</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.760" end="00:29:37.810" style="s2">drive but it would be a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.890" end="00:29:42.070" style="s2">different type of civilization okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.810" end="00:29:43.720" style="s2">and so I would say that that movement to</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.070" end="00:29:45.100" style="s2">a closed loop materials economy is</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.720" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">necessary but no we&#39;re close to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:56.350" style="s2">sufficient one one thing that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:58.570" style="s2">come is if I want to run anything like</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.350" end="00:30:02.230" style="s2">capitalism just from a materials economy</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.570" end="00:30:04.060" style="s2">basis where I&#39;m going to have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.230" end="00:30:05.590" style="s2">growing the capital supply year over</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.060" end="00:30:07.570" style="s2">year just to keep up with interest right</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.590" end="00:30:10.840" style="s2">you there&#39;s an exponential expansion of</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.570" end="00:30:13.240" style="s2">the monetary basis that is required for</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.840" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">capitalism to exist so then to not</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.240" end="00:30:18.790" style="s2">debase the currency we have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:20.440" style="s2">growing the goods and services and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.790" end="00:30:22.090" style="s2">can&#39;t actually in a closed-loop</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.440" end="00:30:24.130" style="s2">materials economy that is near the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.090" end="00:30:27.130" style="s2">carrying capacity I can&#39;t keep growing</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.130" end="00:30:28.480" style="s2">the goods and services indefinitely so</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.130" end="00:30:32.280" style="s2">then of course the argument is well</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.480" end="00:30:34.720" style="s2">we can do it almost all digitally and</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.280" end="00:30:35.919" style="s2">this a bit of a complex argument but I</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.720" end="00:30:38.500" style="s2">would say there are some coupling</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.919" end="00:30:40.419" style="s2">coefficients between how much virtual</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.500" end="00:30:42.190" style="s2">value we have that keeps being valued</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.419" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t go into diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.190" end="00:30:45.880" style="s2">relative to how much physical value that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:48.549" style="s2">there&#39;s some coupling coefficients</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.880" end="00:30:49.960" style="s2">between atoms energy and bits that make</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.549" end="00:30:56.950" style="s2">up the materials economy and then also</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.960" end="00:30:59.020" style="s2">time human attention so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.950" end="00:31:00.940" style="s2">that we can keep running a exponential</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.020" end="00:31:05.790" style="s2">capital expansion but I&#39;ll make a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.940" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">simpler argument capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.790" end="00:31:10.690" style="s2">nationalism but feudalism is also an</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:13.470" style="s2">example our rival risk game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.690" end="00:31:15.520" style="s2">structures some in group competing</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.470" end="00:31:16.840" style="s2">against somehow group and we can play</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.520" end="00:31:18.340" style="s2">coordination games where we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:19.960" style="s2">coordinate with each other if it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.340" end="00:31:21.850" style="s2">advantageous but we reserve the right to</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.960" end="00:31:26.049" style="s2">defect and go zero-sum on each other if</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.850" end="00:31:28.360" style="s2">that&#39;s more advantageous and we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.049" end="00:31:31.480" style="s2">been employing more and more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.360" end="00:31:33.850" style="s2">technology to play rival risk games that</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.480" end="00:31:36.910" style="s2">means more and more potent warfare more</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:40.779" style="s2">later either something like what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:33:44.409" end="00:33:47.320" style="s2">maybe we should talk a little bit about</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.320" end="00:33:54.669" style="s2">probably into it or you know just</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.429" end="00:33:57.399" style="s2">requires an increasing amount of luck as</p>

<p begin="00:33:59.289" end="00:34:02.260" style="s2">think that people who had direct</p>

<p begin="00:34:02.260" end="00:34:07.809" style="s2">War two and maybe World War one they</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.320" end="00:34:10.089" style="s2">weren&#39;t fooled into thinking that this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.809" end="00:34:12.490" style="s2">was an easy game and that life was</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.089" end="00:34:15.750" style="s2">simple they had had enough primary</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.490" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">experience with really catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.750" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">events that they knew that they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:24.429" style="s2">playing with the full stack okay there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:26.230" style="s2">a there&#39;s a bunch of directions that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.429" end="00:34:28.210" style="s2">interested in going so one is World War</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.230" end="00:34:30.909" style="s2">2 was the first time that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.210" end="00:34:33.790" style="s2">had existential level technology as the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.909" end="00:34:34.990" style="s2">species in our recorded history that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.790" end="00:34:36.460" style="s2">big deal because we couldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.990" end="00:34:39.700" style="s2">actually blown ourselves up before then</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.460" end="00:34:41.379" style="s2">and in evolutionary time or even</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.700" end="00:34:43.089" style="s2">civilization time that&#39;s just like a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.379" end="00:34:47.139" style="s2">minutes right like this not very long</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.089" end="00:34:48.909" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had that I agree and if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.139" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">read like if you read Ellsberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.909" end="00:34:52.869" style="s2">doomsday machine it is kind of lucky</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.280" style="s2">that we haven&#39;t blown ourselves up</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.869" end="00:34:55.540" style="s2">because there were a lot of just</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.280" end="00:34:59.890" style="s2">mistakes it should have blown</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.540" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">right but it&#39;s really hard to build</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.890" end="00:35:04.930" style="s2">nukes right it really takes nation state</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:07.240" style="s2">level capacity and mostly only a few</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.930" end="00:35:09.250" style="s2">nation states so could do it yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.240" end="00:35:11.520" style="s2">this is the point is that if you only</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.250" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">have a few actors that have nukes</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.520" end="00:35:15.220" style="s2">everybody can monitor each other and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:18.940" style="s2">have something like mutually assured</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.220" end="00:35:20.980" style="s2">destruction to force an equilibrium but</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.940" end="00:35:22.420" style="s2">this is the thing about exponential tech</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.980" end="00:35:25.170" style="s2">is we don&#39;t just get exponentially more</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.420" end="00:35:27.970" style="s2">powerful tech we get exponentially more</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.170" end="00:35:29.470" style="s2">distribution on powerful tech Daniel I</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.970" end="00:35:31.150" style="s2">want to keep going with this but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.470" end="00:35:32.860" style="s2">gonna keep slowing you down when you use</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.150" end="00:35:36.040" style="s2">a term that may not be familiar to a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.860" end="00:35:38.890" style="s2">sufficient number of our listeners what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.040" end="00:35:43.210" style="s2">do you mean by X is exponential tech so</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.890" end="00:35:45.580" style="s2">tech that helps us make better tech so</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.210" end="00:35:48.520" style="s2">we get a return curve on the technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.580" end="00:35:50.860" style="s2">so we see this kind of exponential the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.520" end="00:35:52.840" style="s2">very famously Moore&#39;s law in computing</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.860" end="00:35:55.900" style="s2">we see this kind of exponential rate of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.840" end="00:35:58.030" style="s2">growth of computing power because like</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.900" end="00:35:59.470" style="s2">nuclear bombs don&#39;t actually give us</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.030" end="00:36:01.330" style="s2">better insight into how to make nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.470" end="00:36:02.590" style="s2">bombs directly but computers give us</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.330" end="00:36:06.370" style="s2">better insight into how to make better</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.590" end="00:36:08.110" style="s2">computers and so there are different</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.370" end="00:36:10.660" style="s2">areas of exponential tech where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.110" end="00:36:12.340" style="s2">technology itself increases our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.660" end="00:36:13.840" style="s2">to make more of the technology or some</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.340" end="00:36:16.300" style="s2">underlying dynamic where we get some</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.840" end="00:36:18.730" style="s2">exponential increases in our capacity so</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.300" end="00:36:21.630" style="s2">we can see for varying reasons</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.730" end="00:36:24.190" style="s2">exponential increases in compute power</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.630" end="00:36:26.350" style="s2">exponential increases in certain types</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.190" end="00:36:29.110" style="s2">of biotech like specifically things</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.350" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">associated with like CRISPR genetic</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.110" end="00:36:36.460" style="s2">engineering gene drives nanotech and</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:38.020" style="s2">those things all you get Exponential&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.460" end="00:36:40.360" style="s2">also because they&#39;re we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.020" end="00:36:43.360" style="s2">things that could self replicate right</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.360" end="00:36:45.400" style="s2">and so a nuclear bomb is a big deal but</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.360" end="00:36:47.290" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t self replicate but a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.400" end="00:36:48.940" style="s2">synthetic biology device can self</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.290" end="00:36:50.860" style="s2">replicate or a genetically engineered</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.940" end="00:36:55.530" style="s2">thing can and so we can have exponential</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.860" end="00:36:55.530" style="s2">growth of the effect of something and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.490" end="00:37:03.000" style="s2">if we if we take a look at the growth in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.210" end="00:37:06.850" style="s2">biotechnology capacity and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.230" end="00:37:08.670" style="s2">specifically look at breakthroughs like</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.850" end="00:37:10.770" style="s2">CRISPR tech</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.670" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">and the capacity for things like gene</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.770" end="00:37:18.660" style="s2">drives to be able to modify foundational</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:20.940" style="s2">biology well that makes it to where by a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.660" end="00:37:23.250" style="s2">warfare capacity like very high level by</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.940" end="00:37:24.390" style="s2">a warfare capacity becomes much much</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.250" end="00:37:26.309" style="s2">much simpler so things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.390" end="00:37:28.589" style="s2">nation-states used to be able to do non</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.309" end="00:37:31.079" style="s2">nation-states are gaining the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.589" end="00:37:34.049" style="s2">to be able to do even drone tech like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.079" end="00:37:35.880" style="s2">had the the first everybody&#39;s who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.049" end="00:37:37.349" style="s2">thought about it has been like when are</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.880" end="00:37:39.210" style="s2">we going to have a really big problem</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.349" end="00:37:40.829" style="s2">with drones and a couple years ago was</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.210" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">the first time in the Ukraine where a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.829" end="00:37:45.000" style="s2">commercial drone with a homemade</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:46.859" style="s2">thermite bomb dropped it on a munitions</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.000" end="00:37:48.270" style="s2">factory and because they had a munitions</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.859" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">factory and detonated the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.270" end="00:37:52.589" style="s2">you get a billion dollars of damage from</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:54.270" style="s2">just they can be one person doing a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.589" end="00:37:56.430" style="s2">simple thing in their garage with out</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.270" end="00:38:00.660" style="s2">any kind of really traceable exotic</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.430" end="00:38:04.040" style="s2">materials but we can do we can we can do</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.660" end="00:38:05.790" style="s2">much worse things than that with</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.040" end="00:38:07.559" style="s2">exponentially increasing technological</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.790" end="00:38:09.900" style="s2">power so the main thing when I say</p>

<p begin="00:38:09.900" end="00:38:15.690" style="s2">an exponential increase in how powerful</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.940" end="00:38:17.220" style="s2">the choices we make can be and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.690" end="00:38:19.829" style="s2">good way to think about technology as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.220" end="00:38:20.849" style="s2">lever on our choice making right so no</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.829" end="00:38:22.920" style="s2">technology at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.849" end="00:38:24.990" style="s2">I can make different choices if I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.920" end="00:38:26.700" style="s2">to be violent I can hit somebody stone</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.990" end="00:38:29.339" style="s2">tool allows me to extend my hitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.700" end="00:38:31.230" style="s2">capacity and hit much harder right a gun</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.339" end="00:38:33.240" style="s2">takes that much further and an</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.230" end="00:38:34.950" style="s2">intercontinental ballistic missile takes</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.240" end="00:38:38.819" style="s2">that much further which it&#39;s a similar</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.950" end="00:38:40.559" style="s2">type of choice to make which is solve</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.819" end="00:38:43.290" style="s2">this problem through violence extended</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.559" end="00:38:45.450" style="s2">by a much much bigger lever and what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.290" end="00:38:47.430" style="s2">would say is if you look at the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.450" end="00:38:50.760" style="s2">people we have ever been like look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.430" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">the Romans look at the Sumerians look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.760" end="00:38:53.700" style="s2">the mines look at any kind of people</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve been and look at the distribution</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.700" end="00:38:57.960" style="s2">of ways we&#39;ve made choices take any of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:38:58.650" style="s2">those people and give them exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.960" end="00:39:00.059" style="s2">more power</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.650" end="00:39:03.809" style="s2">factoring how they&#39;ve used their power</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.059" end="00:39:05.849" style="s2">and they self-terminate like they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.809" end="00:39:07.170" style="s2">use they&#39;re not good stewards of power</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.849" end="00:39:09.180" style="s2">and well I agree that we&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.170" end="00:39:12.599" style="s2">stewards of power I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.180" end="00:39:14.460" style="s2">a mystery here that if we don&#39;t make eye</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.599" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">contact with it it&#39;s going to dog the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.460" end="00:39:21.390" style="s2">conversation we&#39;ve got a lot of missing</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:22.050" style="s2">Stinger missiles I believe from the</p>

<p begin="00:39:25.620" end="00:39:32.730" style="s2">many but I think I heard that it was in</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.110" end="00:39:35.520" style="s2">the hundreds yet we didn&#39;t see a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.730" end="00:39:36.810" style="s2">use maybe you know TWA flight 800 had</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.520" end="00:39:41.180" style="s2">something to do with it maybe not we</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.810" end="00:39:44.340" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s a mysterious situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.180" end="00:39:46.440" style="s2">there are plenty of reservoirs to poison</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.340" end="00:39:48.300" style="s2">people always talked about that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.440" end="00:39:50.940" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen that behavior it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.300" end="00:39:53.700" style="s2">me that these terrible shootings that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.940" end="00:39:55.740" style="s2">experienced I&#39;m always astounded that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.700" end="00:39:58.650" style="s2">the numbers are as low as they are and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.740" end="00:40:02.550" style="s2">you could make an argument that said</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.650" end="00:40:06.030" style="s2">that in general people who are not in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.550" end="00:40:09.240" style="s2">position to benefit or engaged in some</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:11.480" style="s2">sort of self terminating activity people</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.240" end="00:40:17.580" style="s2">who are planning to go out with a with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.480" end="00:40:21.540" style="s2">bang if you will are not very successful</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.580" end="00:40:24.840" style="s2">usually in doing huge amounts of damage</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.540" end="00:40:27.860" style="s2">now that may change so like we know that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.840" end="00:40:31.230" style="s2">from the murrah Federal Building that</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.860" end="00:40:33.710" style="s2">fertilizer is a pretty potent bomb</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.230" end="00:40:38.100" style="s2">ingredient and yet we didn&#39;t see a huge</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.710" end="00:40:45.290" style="s2">string of copycats after that is there</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.100" end="00:40:48.300" style="s2">something in us that is sort of capable</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.290" end="00:40:51.180" style="s2">in an act of desperation and depression</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.300" end="00:40:58.590" style="s2">of killing tens of people that struggles</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.180" end="00:41:00.750" style="s2">to kill thousands or millions you</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.590" end="00:41:04.200" style="s2">understand the Quai is a mystery yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.750" end="00:41:06.150" style="s2">I think there&#39;s some positive things we</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.200" end="00:41:08.010" style="s2">have going for us which is there</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.150" end="00:41:11.190" style="s2">generally tends to be an inverse</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.010" end="00:41:12.780" style="s2">correlation between people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.190" end="00:41:15.150" style="s2">really good at tech and people who want</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.780" end="00:41:17.810" style="s2">to blow things up like typically those</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.150" end="00:41:22.290" style="s2">the people who want to blow things up</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.810" end="00:41:24.630" style="s2">mostly don&#39;t figure out how to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.290" end="00:41:26.250" style="s2">really good bioweapons right and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.630" end="00:41:29.010" style="s2">people who are really engaged in how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.250" end="00:41:31.320" style="s2">make more powerful breakthroughs in</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.010" end="00:41:32.940" style="s2">science and tech are usually engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.320" end="00:41:34.350" style="s2">some creative enterprise where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.940" end="00:41:35.410" style="s2">not oriented to blow things up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.350" end="00:41:37.030" style="s2">actually like really</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.410" end="00:41:39.849" style="s2">important I think that&#39;s going well for</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.030" end="00:41:41.619" style="s2">us I think that depends upon certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.849" end="00:41:42.970" style="s2">social things staying in place that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.619" end="00:41:49.900" style="s2">can&#39;t guarantee are going to stay so</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.970" end="00:41:51.280" style="s2">Jays a relatively viable society for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.900" end="00:41:54.369" style="s2">people who have the technological</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.280" end="00:41:56.859" style="s2">capacities I this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.369" end="00:42:00.819" style="s2">fascinates me we seem to be very willing</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.859" end="00:42:04.539" style="s2">to destroy the lives of very capable</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.819" end="00:42:08.020" style="s2">people these days yeah III and I always</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.539" end="00:42:10.780" style="s2">wonder like are we going to be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.020" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">when somebody whose life we&#39;ve ruined</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.780" end="00:42:17.349" style="s2">over nothing comes back at us and saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.440" end="00:42:19.059" style="s2">wow you really you wrote me off and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.349" end="00:42:20.710" style="s2">destroyed my reputation my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.059" end="00:42:22.839" style="s2">earn a living I can&#39;t have a security</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.710" end="00:42:27.220" style="s2">clearance I can&#39;t do what it is that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.839" end="00:42:30.190" style="s2">enjoy doing and now I&#39;m on the outs I am</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.220" end="00:42:32.289" style="s2">terrified for example then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.190" end="00:42:35.500" style="s2">famously the James d&#39;amore situation</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.289" end="00:42:38.380" style="s2">where you start going after very bright</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.500" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">sort of spectrum II people and you tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.380" end="00:42:44.440" style="s2">them that they&#39;re horrible and you ruin</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:47.980" style="s2">them publicly that&#39;s a very bad recipe I</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.440" end="00:42:49.299" style="s2">think it is a bad recipe and and of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.980" end="00:42:51.849" style="s2">course James de Moura is not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.299" end="00:42:54.520" style="s2">particular risk but there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.849" end="00:42:56.710" style="s2">people who are very capable yeah who</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.520" end="00:43:02.099" style="s2">took one look at that situation said oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.710" end="00:43:07.599" style="s2">so now no longer can I be can I count on</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.099" end="00:43:09.849" style="s2">getting things largely right maybe I get</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.599" end="00:43:11.349" style="s2">some stuff wrong around the edges but no</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.849" end="00:43:15.160" style="s2">longer can I count on making interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.349" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">points and having a job when I get up</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.160" end="00:43:19.779" style="s2">the next morning well like when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:21.880" style="s2">mentioning shootings if I can just go</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.779" end="00:43:23.950" style="s2">buy an ar-15 even if I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.880" end="00:43:25.029" style="s2">make one right then I can kill a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.950" end="00:43:28.690" style="s2">more people than I can with a knife</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.029" end="00:43:31.170" style="s2">right and so the that&#39;s an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.690" end="00:43:34.270" style="s2">technological capacity that can empower</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.170" end="00:43:35.829" style="s2">someone who is psychologically damaged</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.270" end="00:43:38.020" style="s2">somehow to be able to do things they</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.829" end="00:43:41.049" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do without it and I think as</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.020" end="00:43:45.579" style="s2">more powerful technology requires less</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.049" end="00:43:49.070" style="s2">scientific insight to be able to modify</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.579" end="00:43:51.590" style="s2">then you&#39;re certainly going to see more</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.070" end="00:43:53.270" style="s2">those types of dynamics increase I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.590" end="00:43:55.460" style="s2">one of the other things is that when we</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.270" end="00:43:57.920" style="s2">think about the Cold War we really had</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.460" end="00:44:00.580" style="s2">two nuclear superpowers that could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.920" end="00:44:04.220" style="s2">locked and mutually assured destruction</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.580" end="00:44:06.500" style="s2">because with just two forces you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.220" end="00:44:08.120" style="s2">have an easy Nash equilibrium but as</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.500" end="00:44:09.950" style="s2">soon as you have a lot of forces and</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.120" end="00:44:11.150" style="s2">it&#39;s more multipolar it&#39;s a much much</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.950" end="00:44:14.120" style="s2">harder thing this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.150" end="00:44:17.090" style="s2">terrifies me which is that I would much</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.120" end="00:44:21.170" style="s2">rather have two very skilled hyper</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.090" end="00:44:22.880" style="s2">lethal powers in some kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.170" end="00:44:26.240" style="s2">community game theoretic communication</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.880" end="00:44:29.930" style="s2">with each other then lots of less</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.240" end="00:44:32.530" style="s2">skilled players with much less power but</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.930" end="00:44:35.390" style="s2">significant ability to do damage right</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.530" end="00:44:38.950" style="s2">which we have now you know and we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.390" end="00:44:41.240" style="s2">increasingly so right so we went from</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.950" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">one country with nukes at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.240" end="00:44:46.340" style="s2">World War two to then too quickly in</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:48.710" style="s2">Cold War type dynamics to you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.340" end="00:44:50.330" style="s2">whatever nine on record if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.710" end="00:44:52.670" style="s2">count where all the missing uranium from</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.330" end="00:44:54.830" style="s2">the USSR that is in whatever place is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.670" end="00:44:56.210" style="s2">that it&#39;s in that and that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.830" end="00:45:00.670" style="s2">just talking about nukes we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.210" end="00:45:05.420" style="s2">about lots of other things so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.670" end="00:45:07.580" style="s2">think the gist is that rival risk type</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.420" end="00:45:09.500" style="s2">dynamics whether we&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.580" end="00:45:11.930" style="s2">rivalry that&#39;s a kinetic warfare like</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.500" end="00:45:14.900" style="s2">this right like a physical warfare right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.930" end="00:45:16.940" style="s2">or an economic warfare or an information</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.900" end="00:45:18.920" style="s2">warfare end up resulting in</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.940" end="00:45:21.410" style="s2">progressively more harm as we have more</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.920" end="00:45:23.950" style="s2">power because the gist is if we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.410" end="00:45:27.110" style="s2">some kind of warfare of whatever kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:29.060" style="s2">then I need to figure out some</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.110" end="00:45:30.950" style="s2">asymmetric capacity to be able to beat</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.060" end="00:45:32.930" style="s2">you but the moment I deploy that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.950" end="00:45:35.150" style="s2">asymmetric capacity it gets reverse</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.930" end="00:45:37.610" style="s2">engineered by all sides and up ratcheted</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.150" end="00:45:40.520" style="s2">so we get this exponential up ratcheting</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.610" end="00:45:44.900" style="s2">of the game the power itself yeah if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.520" end="00:45:47.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t in the game right and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.900" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">what we see is we see an exponential</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.000" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">increase in destructive capacity without</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:56.090" style="s2">a fundamental change in the basis of how</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:59.270" style="s2">we use it so let&#39;s just look at</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.090" end="00:46:01.049" style="s2">information tech and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.270" end="00:46:05.369" style="s2">really key to the how we change</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.049" end="00:46:07.529" style="s2">civilization part if information about</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.369" end="00:46:09.989" style="s2">reality is a source of competitive</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.529" end="00:46:12.689" style="s2">advantage like from I know where the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.989" end="00:46:14.640" style="s2">water is and so but we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.689" end="00:46:15.659" style="s2">there&#39;s enough for everybody so not only</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.640" end="00:46:17.279" style="s2">do we want to withhold that information</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.659" end="00:46:18.929" style="s2">from the other tribe we want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.279" end="00:46:21.959" style="s2">misinform them as to where it is so they</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.929" end="00:46:23.669" style="s2">don&#39;t accidentally find it right you see</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.959" end="00:46:25.739" style="s2">in every competitive game whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.669" end="00:46:26.999" style="s2">poker bluff or a football game or you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.739" end="00:46:31.259" style="s2">fake one way and go the other way</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.999" end="00:46:33.689" style="s2">a incentive to dis inform right and as</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.259" end="00:46:37.140" style="s2">we start having exponential information</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.689" end="00:46:39.149" style="s2">texts so we can intentionally dis inform</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.140" end="00:46:40.829" style="s2">specific audiences in ways that are much</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.149" end="00:46:42.599" style="s2">more believable to them so you talk</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.829" end="00:46:45.390" style="s2">about Russell conjugation Russell</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.599" end="00:46:46.829" style="s2">conjugation is you want to I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.390" end="00:46:48.779" style="s2">that we&#39;ve talked about it too much on</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.779" end="00:46:52.380" style="s2">I since you&#39;re gonna take it somewhere</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.380" end="00:46:55.949" style="s2">when do you say a little bit of what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.640" end="00:46:59.909" style="s2">is I can dis inform without even lying</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.949" end="00:47:03.509" style="s2">yeah right I can formally lie but I can</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.909" end="00:47:05.279" style="s2">also just make someone more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.509" end="00:47:07.499" style="s2">interpret something in a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.279" end="00:47:09.569" style="s2">by couching a question or couching an</p>

<p begin="00:47:09.569" end="00:47:14.489" style="s2">reaction so you gave I think a great</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.339" end="00:47:16.609" style="s2">example of if I talk about illegal</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.489" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">aliens the problem of illegal aliens</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.609" end="00:47:23.099" style="s2">versus the need for amnesty for migrant</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.099" end="00:47:28.319" style="s2">workers then just the nature of the</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.319" end="00:47:31.979" style="s2">evokes very different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.939" end="00:47:34.289" style="s2">sensibilities and people so they&#39;ll vote</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.979" end="00:47:38.039" style="s2">differently they&#39;ll poll differently so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.289" end="00:47:40.019" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty easy to influence what</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.039" end="00:47:42.329" style="s2">people think and how they feel through</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.019" end="00:47:44.729" style="s2">of course lying but also through not</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.329" end="00:47:46.829" style="s2">just lying but sharing partial data so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.729" end="00:47:48.209" style="s2">the preponderance of data gives them a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.829" end="00:47:49.529" style="s2">sense of things that is other than it</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.209" end="00:47:51.149" style="s2">really is and through things like</p>

<p begin="00:47:51.149" end="00:47:58.019" style="s2">just kind of hijacking their limbic</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.399" end="00:48:00.839" style="s2">system a very fun very funny one is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.019" end="00:48:03.239" style="s2">use of the Democrat Party where you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.839" end="00:48:05.939" style="s2">emphasize the word rat rather than</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.239" end="00:48:08.969" style="s2">saying the Democratic Party and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.939" end="00:48:11.669" style="s2">great fun for Republicans to say yes the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.969" end="00:48:13.280" style="s2">Democrat can&#39;t you know it&#39;s a whoa that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.669" end="00:48:16.859" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound good</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.280" end="00:48:18.000" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s a defensible position what</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.859" end="00:48:21.089" style="s2">are you talking about it&#39;s just the way</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.000" end="00:48:23.760" style="s2">I say it right okay so a plausible</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.089" end="00:48:25.859" style="s2">deniability on engaging in a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.760" end="00:48:27.270" style="s2">narrative warfare right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.859" end="00:48:29.790" style="s2">supposed to be that we&#39;re both on Team</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.270" end="00:48:32.339" style="s2">USA right working together to make the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.790" end="00:48:33.809" style="s2">best country possible maybe in rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.339" end="00:48:35.400" style="s2">with other countries but hopefully even</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.809" end="00:48:37.470" style="s2">in some kind of economic trade</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.400" end="00:48:39.150" style="s2">prosperous relationship right but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.470" end="00:48:41.819" style="s2">obviously not both on Team USA we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.150" end="00:48:43.819" style="s2">actually engaged in really dreadful</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.819" end="00:48:48.210" style="s2">zero-sum dynamics with each other well</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.819" end="00:48:51.900" style="s2">intentionally confusing and misinforming</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.210" end="00:48:54.710" style="s2">the public and increasing animosity even</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.900" end="00:48:57.270" style="s2">towards the point of civil conflict for</p>

<p begin="00:48:57.270" end="00:49:02.579" style="s2">mm-hmm and we see that that&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.790" end="00:49:06.180" style="s2">true with Republican and Democrat but</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.579" end="00:49:07.410" style="s2">even like mmm multiple intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.180" end="00:49:09.059" style="s2">agencies it should be sharing</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.410" end="00:49:10.650" style="s2">intelligence perfectly with each other</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.059" end="00:49:12.180" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually competing for who</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.650" end="00:49:13.950" style="s2">gets a larger percentage of the black</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.180" end="00:49:15.750" style="s2">budget so they&#39;ll withhold information</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.950" end="00:49:17.819" style="s2">and maybe even engage in internal</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.750" end="00:49:20.040" style="s2">espionage all the way it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.819" end="00:49:21.480" style="s2">corporate politics where people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.040" end="00:49:22.950" style="s2">really making a choice in a big</p>

<p begin="00:49:29.609" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">then engaging in corporate politics it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:33.900" style="s2">might actually be hurting the company so</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:36.180" style="s2">long as they can have plausible</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.900" end="00:49:37.740" style="s2">deniability to get away with it so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.180" end="00:49:39.930" style="s2">whenever we have perverse incentives</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.740" end="00:49:43.140" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have some situation by which</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.930" end="00:49:45.630" style="s2">we&#39;re being incentivized by a system of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.140" end="00:49:49.589" style="s2">selective pressures to do certain things</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.630" end="00:49:51.329" style="s2">that may not be in the stated interests</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.589" end="00:49:54.589" style="s2">or the you know whatever the directive</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.329" end="00:49:57.059" style="s2">is of our of our institution so the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.589" end="00:49:59.940" style="s2">directive is to do the business of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.059" end="00:50:02.250" style="s2">country but in fact you&#39;re loyal to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.940" end="00:50:04.109" style="s2">team that you&#39;re on because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.250" end="00:50:06.450" style="s2">brought you to this place and it were</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.109" end="00:50:08.490" style="s2">you to lose your team inside of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.450" end="00:50:09.089" style="s2">internal game you couldn&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.089" end="00:50:13.589" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s actually not even the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.549" end="00:50:15.270" style="s2">fault of some bad people it&#39;s a fault of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.589" end="00:50:17.099" style="s2">a system where it&#39;s like I say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.270" end="00:50:18.599" style="s2">if I don&#39;t do that then I lose the game</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.099" end="00:50:19.859" style="s2">to the other guys that are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.599" end="00:50:21.750" style="s2">and I actually think I&#39;m more qualified</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.859" end="00:50:24.270" style="s2">to get that promotion than he is so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.750" end="00:50:25.809" style="s2">is the compromise I have to make which</p>

<p begin="00:50:25.809" end="00:50:29.739" style="s2">we could think of as politics right my</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.089" end="00:50:33.789" style="s2">brother is called this I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.739" end="00:50:35.949" style="s2">beautiful job describing this he called</p>

<p begin="00:50:45.279" end="00:50:49.539" style="s2">yeah Brett&#39;s point was if that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.650" end="00:50:51.459" style="s2">self-extinguishing then you&#39;ll simply be</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.539" end="00:50:53.559" style="s2">replaced by something less ethical than</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.459" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">you are so it&#39;s actually incumbent upon</p>

<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:01.239" style="s2">remove yourself from the game leaving</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.079" end="00:51:03.309" style="s2">open a niche for some less scrupulous</p>

<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.939" style="s2">hopeful about game B is that a good way</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.439" end="00:52:18.880" style="s2">of phrasing it is there a better way of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.939" end="00:52:23.170" style="s2">talking about this he yes and to be able</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.880" end="00:52:25.989" style="s2">to define what game B what criteria must</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.170" end="00:52:29.109" style="s2">have understanding the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.989" end="00:52:30.759" style="s2">self extinguishing in game a like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.109" end="00:52:32.410" style="s2">take a couple of the examples you just</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.759" end="00:52:35.199" style="s2">gave and go a little further because</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.410" end="00:52:37.529" style="s2">there there were a along lines connected</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.199" end="00:52:39.370" style="s2">to where we were you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.529" end="00:52:44.500" style="s2">internalizing externalities</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.370" end="00:52:46.750" style="s2">right so if I if I am figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.500" end="00:52:48.790" style="s2">to externalize some cost of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.750" end="00:52:51.220" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing to the Commons and so for</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.790" end="00:52:53.800" style="s2">example you&#39;re polluting as part of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.220" end="00:52:55.270" style="s2">furniture plant that employs lots of</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.800" end="00:52:57.120" style="s2">people and make something people need</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.270" end="00:53:00.040" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a real cost right it</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.120" end="00:53:01.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a cost to a whole ecosystem into</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.040" end="00:53:03.430" style="s2">the people into the future generations</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.900" end="00:53:05.530" style="s2">it&#39;ll be affected by the pollution but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.430" end="00:53:08.680" style="s2">don&#39;t pay the cost and because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.530" end="00:53:10.510" style="s2">paying the cost I get to have the profit</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.680" end="00:53:12.100" style="s2">margins that I have if I had to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.510" end="00:53:14.290" style="s2">cost which mean I had the employ a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.100" end="00:53:15.670" style="s2">technology that currently exists to</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.290" end="00:53:18.010" style="s2">clean all that up and whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.670" end="00:53:22.060" style="s2">costs my business might be radically not</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.010" end="00:53:25.510" style="s2">profitable right now so so then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.060" end="00:53:27.700" style="s2">we&#39;ll try and create a law to make it to</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.510" end="00:53:29.290" style="s2">where I can&#39;t do that pollution but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.700" end="00:53:31.000" style="s2">not doing the pollution as a person I</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.290" end="00:53:34.630" style="s2">have some corporation that has some</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.000" end="00:53:36.190" style="s2">liability limiting functions of any of</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.630" end="00:53:39.250" style="s2">the people within the corporation so the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.190" end="00:53:40.990" style="s2">corporation is breaking the law and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.250" end="00:53:44.710" style="s2">can&#39;t put a corporation in jail so</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.990" end="00:53:46.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a fine but if the fine is less</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.710" end="00:53:47.980" style="s2">expensive than processing the waste</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.630" end="00:53:52.390" style="s2">would be even it&#39;s just a cost of doing</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.980" end="00:53:54.610" style="s2">business and then the corporation will</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.390" end="00:53:59.610" style="s2">employ lobbyists to go change the law</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.610" end="00:54:01.630" style="s2">because laws are going to be created by</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.610" end="00:54:03.700" style="s2">lobbyists that are paid for by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.630" end="00:54:05.380" style="s2">and they&#39;re going to be created by</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.700" end="00:54:07.000" style="s2">politicians who have a campaign budget</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.380" end="00:54:09.520" style="s2">that is controlled by somebody so</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.000" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">basically economics has perverse</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.520" end="00:54:14.020" style="s2">incentives we try to create law to bind</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">it but economics is deeper in the stack</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.020" end="00:54:19.450" style="s2">of power than law is so you end up</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:21.130" style="s2">getting this legal system that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.450" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">supposed to bind the perverse economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.130" end="00:54:25.840" style="s2">incentive that mostly ends up</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:28.210" style="s2">legislating and in the benefit of it so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.840" end="00:54:31.630" style="s2">it but and this is a fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.210" end="00:54:35.380" style="s2">with the liberal democracy idea well</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.630" end="00:54:37.510" style="s2">when things get really visual things can</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.380" end="00:54:41.880" style="s2">actually change if you start being able</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.510" end="00:54:44.410" style="s2">to point to oh I don&#39;t know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.880" end="00:54:47.530" style="s2">children with malformed limbs that</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.410" end="00:54:50.410" style="s2">happen with filete imide the visual on</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.530" end="00:54:52.540" style="s2">that was enough to push that up the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.410" end="00:54:54.700" style="s2">attention stack</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.540" end="00:54:57.640" style="s2">to say hey we&#39;ve got a serious problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.700" end="00:55:00.100" style="s2">here and we&#39;ve got to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.640" end="00:55:05.980" style="s2">right now because the the externality of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.100" end="00:55:07.510" style="s2">this pharmaceutical is is horrific do</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.980" end="00:55:10.660" style="s2">you have anything better than waiting</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.510" end="00:55:14.550" style="s2">for absolutely horrendous things with</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.660" end="00:55:19.480" style="s2">the with visuals that that hit oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.550" end="00:55:23.050" style="s2">so you know it&#39;s funny right like we see</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.480" end="00:55:24.280" style="s2">ads from the 50s we&#39;re better living</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.050" end="00:55:25.930" style="s2">through chemistry and people are</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.280" end="00:55:27.580" style="s2">spraying DDT on the kids to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.930" end="00:55:29.350" style="s2">mosquitoes off and then we recognize how</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.580" end="00:55:31.090" style="s2">lethal the DDT is so then we sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.350" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">Mexico that doesn&#39;t have the law and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.090" end="00:55:35.580" style="s2">then we buy the produce back from Mexico</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:39.370" style="s2">but then we come up with some new</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.580" end="00:55:40.660" style="s2">chemical that we say is less toxic just</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.370" end="00:55:45.130" style="s2">because the long term Studies on its</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.660" end="00:55:46.540" style="s2">toxicity haven&#39;t come out yet and mostly</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.130" end="00:55:48.600" style="s2">they don&#39;t look as visible as</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.540" end="00:55:53.140" style="s2">thalidomide this is the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.600" end="00:55:55.180" style="s2">sometimes I say this as we keep</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.140" end="00:55:59.010" style="s2">searching for our own blind spot so that</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.180" end="00:56:02.560" style="s2">we can do business there right and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.010" end="00:56:04.210" style="s2">what it is that we can&#39;t measure very</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.560" end="00:56:06.160" style="s2">often becomes a place to do business</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.210" end="00:56:08.860" style="s2">because almost everything produces</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.160" end="00:56:11.140" style="s2">negative externalities and so it has to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.860" end="00:56:12.760" style="s2">be disguised now this is a concept I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.140" end="00:56:17.140" style="s2">wanted to bring up in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.760" end="00:56:19.840" style="s2">you&#39;re saying about your brother and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.140" end="00:56:24.460" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea of a multipolar trap</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.840" end="00:56:25.720" style="s2">which is some scenario where some agent</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.460" end="00:56:28.810" style="s2">in the system whether the agent is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.720" end="00:56:31.690" style="s2">person or a nation or a tribe or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.810" end="00:56:33.400" style="s2">corporation does something that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.690" end="00:56:34.630" style="s2">really bad for the whole over the long</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.400" end="00:56:36.550" style="s2">term but it&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.630" end="00:56:40.720" style="s2">advantageous to them over the near term</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.550" end="00:56:43.150" style="s2">and if they do that they will get so far</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.720" end="00:56:44.740" style="s2">ahead of and use that power against</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.150" end="00:56:46.360" style="s2">everybody else that now everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.740" end="00:56:48.250" style="s2">has to race to do that thing and you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.360" end="00:56:50.980" style="s2">a race to the cliff so an arms race is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.250" end="00:56:52.900" style="s2">classic example right we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.980" end="00:56:56.050" style="s2">want a world with AI weapons it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.900" end="00:56:57.910" style="s2">less good world with AI weapons but we</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.050" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">would have to ensure that nobody makes</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.910" end="00:57:00.610" style="s2">them we&#39;d have to make an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:01.810" style="s2">where if anyone doesn&#39;t join the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.610" end="00:57:03.280" style="s2">agreement and says no we&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.810" end="00:57:05.050" style="s2">the AI whip and then everybody has to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:05.829" style="s2">not only make them but also make the</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.050" end="00:57:08.200" style="s2">countermeasures and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.829" end="00:57:09.849" style="s2">race to make them faster mm-hm and even</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.200" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">if we make the agreement we&#39;re pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.849" end="00:57:14.170" style="s2">sure the other guy is secretly defecting</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:15.369" style="s2">on the agreement in the basement so we</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.170" end="00:57:16.930" style="s2">make the agreement while secretly</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.369" end="00:57:18.309" style="s2">defecting on it in the basement while</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.930" end="00:57:19.989" style="s2">spying on them and trying to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.309" end="00:57:21.430" style="s2">their spies and it&#39;s like how the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.989" end="00:57:22.930" style="s2">do we get out of that and the same is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.430" end="00:57:24.519" style="s2">true the tragedy of the Commons if I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.930" end="00:57:27.369" style="s2">figure out how to externalize some of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.519" end="00:57:28.749" style="s2">cost and so my margins go up all of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.369" end="00:57:31.089" style="s2">competitors have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.749" end="00:57:32.319" style="s2">externalize some cost or we have to try</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.089" end="00:57:34.150" style="s2">and figure out how to make some law to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.319" end="00:57:39.430" style="s2">bind it but it&#39;s very hard to make laws</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.150" end="00:57:41.769" style="s2">to bind these things and so the same is</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.430" end="00:57:43.900" style="s2">true with ethical issues right if I am</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.769" end="00:57:46.749" style="s2">perfectly ethical I am going to lose in</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.900" end="00:57:48.819" style="s2">politics because I won&#39;t be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.749" end="00:57:52.539" style="s2">anybody to support me whatever so I make</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.819" end="00:57:55.239" style="s2">certain kinds of compromises and so one</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.539" end="00:57:58.959" style="s2">thing I would look at is if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.239" end="00:58:01.660" style="s2">look at catastrophic risk writ large we</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.959" end="00:58:04.690" style="s2">can look at multipolar traps drive as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.660" end="00:58:06.430" style="s2">general game theoretic phenomena driving</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.080" end="00:59:41.240" style="s2">those right right and so everybody</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.850" end="01:00:11.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m saying that that&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="01:00:47.450" end="01:00:53.360" style="s2">problem with game B is that I look at</p>

<p begin="01:00:53.360" end="01:00:58.310" style="s2">at our history in terms of what has</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.420" end="01:00:59.720" style="s2">brought us to this this point and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.310" end="01:01:02.300" style="s2">would say that if you believe any</p>

<p begin="01:05:16.190" end="01:05:20.119" style="s2">whatever and it can use its intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.410" end="01:05:21.859" style="s2">to increase its own intelligence so</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.119" end="01:05:23.539" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a exponential curve on</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.859" end="01:05:25.309" style="s2">intelligence which also then means an</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.539" end="01:05:27.799" style="s2">exponential curve on its capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.309" end="01:05:30.319" style="s2">optimize whatever narrow metric its</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.799" end="01:05:32.479" style="s2">optimizing and so of course after it</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.319" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">just makes increases in efficiency which</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.479" end="01:05:35.390" style="s2">are awesome then it starts making so</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.160" style="s2">many paper clips that it needs new</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.390" end="01:05:39.049" style="s2">substrate to make paperclips out of and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.160" end="01:05:41.630" style="s2">it eventually turns the whole world into</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.049" end="01:05:42.920" style="s2">paperclips because it can it can grow</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.630" end="01:05:45.009" style="s2">its intelligence to out-compete</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.920" end="01:05:48.170" style="s2">whoever&#39;s competing for those paperclips</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.009" end="01:05:49.969" style="s2">faster than they can that&#39;s a very short</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.170" end="01:05:52.910" style="s2">version of it you&#39;re going to say</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.969" end="01:05:54.920" style="s2">something well just</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.910" end="01:05:57.580" style="s2">I guess what I find very bizarre about</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.920" end="01:06:00.380" style="s2">all of this is that I live in multiple</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.580" end="01:06:02.900" style="s2">social worlds and intellectual worlds</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.380" end="01:06:06.860" style="s2">and in some of my worlds this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.900" end="01:06:08.810" style="s2">strikes people as loopy oh here comes</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.860" end="01:06:12.170" style="s2">the stuff about the AGI that the robots</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.810" end="01:06:13.700" style="s2">are gonna kill us all and in some other</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.170" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">portion of my world it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.700" end="01:06:18.710" style="s2">clearly we&#39;re on the verge of AGI and</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:22.820" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be the existential risk</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.710" end="01:06:24.380" style="s2">and this is in part to go back to your</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.820" end="01:06:27.650" style="s2">original point and something that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.380" end="01:06:30.800" style="s2">and I share a failure a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.650" end="01:06:33.410" style="s2">failure of communal sense making right</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.800" end="01:06:35.930" style="s2">so what I&#39;ve claimed is is that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.410" end="01:06:39.230" style="s2">revolution that we&#39;re in is is based</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.930" end="01:06:41.450" style="s2">around the idea that we don&#39;t have what</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.230" end="01:06:45.170" style="s2">I&#39;ve called semi reliable communal sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.450" end="01:06:47.420" style="s2">making we can&#39;t all agree now even if</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.170" end="01:06:49.850" style="s2">it&#39;s slightly wrong or maybe even deeply</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.420" end="01:06:51.860" style="s2">wrong as to what it is that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.850" end="01:06:55.370" style="s2">where we are in human history what our</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.860" end="01:06:57.560" style="s2">issues are and so the first part of this</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.370" end="01:07:00.590" style="s2">decision tree that goes really wrong is</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.560" end="01:07:04.910" style="s2">that a lot of people think that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.590" end="01:07:05.750" style="s2">great shape okay so this is I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.910" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">actually gonna come back to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.750" end="01:07:09.430" style="s2">paperclip Maximizer because it explains</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:11.930" style="s2">why we don&#39;t have communal sense making</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.430" end="01:07:14.030" style="s2">if instead of thinking about an</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.930" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">artificial intelligence they can</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.030" end="01:07:18.170" style="s2">increase its capacity while optimizing</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:19.880" style="s2">something we think of a collective</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.170" end="01:07:21.620" style="s2">intelligence that can some way that</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.880" end="01:07:24.440" style="s2">humans are processing information</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.620" end="01:07:26.060" style="s2">together in a group a market is a kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.440" end="01:07:27.950" style="s2">of collective intelligence right the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.060" end="01:07:29.750" style="s2">whole idea of what the invisible hand of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:32.210" style="s2">the market that the market will figure</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.750" end="01:07:34.070" style="s2">out what stuff people really want it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.210" end="01:07:36.380" style="s2">expressed as demand and then which</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.070" end="01:07:39.490" style="s2">version of the various supplies is best</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.380" end="01:07:41.930" style="s2">that I would say it&#39;s an intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.490" end="01:07:43.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not a central intelligence but the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.930" end="01:07:46.450" style="s2">idea is that there is kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.130" end="01:07:51.980" style="s2">emergent intelligent is an emergent</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.450" end="01:07:53.750" style="s2">property of this thing and you know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.980" end="01:07:55.310" style="s2">computes things like prices and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.750" end="01:07:57.980" style="s2">allocations and if that&#39;s what you mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.310" end="01:08:01.790" style="s2">by intelligence that I oh yeah so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.980" end="01:08:06.110" style="s2">it is a bottom-up coordination system</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.790" end="01:08:06.670" style="s2">that does end up having new information</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.110" end="01:08:08.260" style="s2">emerges</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.670" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">the result of the bottom-up coordination</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.260" end="01:08:14.290" style="s2">okay and I can take a market as a as</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:17.170" style="s2">kind of at the sender I can take</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.290" end="01:08:19.960" style="s2">capitalism at the center of the more</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.170" end="01:08:21.670" style="s2">general class of what I would call rival</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.960" end="01:08:24.370" style="s2">risk dynamics as a whole as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.670" end="01:08:26.140" style="s2">collective intelligence because the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.370" end="01:08:27.910" style="s2">thing that wins at the game of rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.140" end="01:08:29.980" style="s2">gets selected for and so there is this</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.910" end="01:08:32.980" style="s2">kind of learning of how to get better at</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.980" end="01:08:35.530" style="s2">rival risk games learning across the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.980" end="01:08:37.300" style="s2">system as a whole which which things win</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.530" end="01:08:40.180" style="s2">in or which things keep more people</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.300" end="01:08:41.890" style="s2">believing the thing which keep people</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.180" end="01:08:48.370" style="s2">from at ridding out of the thing like</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.890" end="01:08:50.620" style="s2">that that makes sense yes and so I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.370" end="01:08:56.140" style="s2">say that we have if we just take the</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.620" end="01:08:58.090" style="s2">capitalism part capitalism is a paper</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.140" end="01:09:00.460" style="s2">clip Maximizer that is converting the</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.090" end="01:09:02.560" style="s2">natural world and human resources into</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.460" end="01:09:05.710" style="s2">capital while getting better at doing so</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.560" end="01:09:07.720" style="s2">so it goes from barter to currency to</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.710" end="01:09:10.570" style="s2">fiat currency to fractional reserve</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.720" end="01:09:12.700" style="s2">process to complex financial instruments</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.570" end="01:09:15.400" style="s2">to high-speed trading on those those are</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.700" end="01:09:18.120" style="s2">like the increase in its capacity to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.400" end="01:09:20.560" style="s2">that but specifically now it is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.120" end="01:09:21.370" style="s2">incentive for all the humans to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.560" end="01:09:23.830" style="s2">certain things</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.370" end="01:09:26.320" style="s2">so if leaving the whale alive in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.830" end="01:09:28.450" style="s2">ocean confers no economic advantage on</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.320" end="01:09:29.560" style="s2">me but killing it and selling it as meat</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.450" end="01:09:32.440" style="s2">is a million dollars of economic</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.560" end="01:09:33.790" style="s2">advantage and if I don&#39;t kill it the a</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.440" end="01:09:35.170" style="s2">whale still won&#39;t be alive because</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.790" end="01:09:37.060" style="s2">somebody else is gonna kill it anyways</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.170" end="01:09:38.980" style="s2">and then that they might actually even</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.060" end="01:09:41.560" style="s2">use that economic power against me now</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.980" end="01:09:43.180" style="s2">I&#39;ve got I have an incentive system that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.560" end="01:09:45.340" style="s2">is encouraging all the humans to behave</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.180" end="01:09:46.720" style="s2">in certain kinds of ways and now not</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.340" end="01:09:48.280" style="s2">only do we need to kill the whales we</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.720" end="01:09:50.980" style="s2">need to race at getting better to do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.280" end="01:09:53.320" style="s2">and making better militaries and</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.980" end="01:09:56.170" style="s2">extracting all the resources and so I</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.320" end="01:09:58.240" style="s2">see this as a kind of so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.170" end="01:09:59.950" style="s2">understanding where you&#39;re headed what</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.240" end="01:10:06.180" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is is that the market is</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.950" end="01:10:11.340" style="s2">kind of a precursor to an AGI it is a</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.180" end="01:10:11.340" style="s2">collective intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.360" end="01:10:17.260" style="s2">eventually self terminating in the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.190" end="01:10:19.090" style="s2">way that a cancer is right the cancer</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.260" end="01:10:19.630" style="s2">cells are self-replicating and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.090" end="01:10:21.400" style="s2">growing</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.630" end="01:10:23.350" style="s2">to the normal cells but they end up</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.400" end="01:10:27.940" style="s2">killing the host which kills themselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.350" end="01:10:29.830" style="s2">and so the the reason I&#39;m bringing this</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.940" end="01:10:33.370" style="s2">up in terms of collective sense making</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.830" end="01:10:35.110" style="s2">is those who do the will of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.370" end="01:10:37.719" style="s2">like those who do the will of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.110" end="01:10:39.400" style="s2">paperclip Maximizer Moloch&#39;s or on</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.719" end="01:10:42.280" style="s2">whatever kind of analogy we want to use</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.400" end="01:10:44.860" style="s2">here those who do well at the game of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.280" end="01:10:46.690" style="s2">power get more power and then they use</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.860" end="01:10:49.960" style="s2">that legislative power media power</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.690" end="01:10:51.610" style="s2">capital power to make systems that to</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.960" end="01:10:54.550" style="s2">modify the systems in ways that help</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.610" end="01:10:56.800" style="s2">them more right those who oppose the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.550" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">system of power also oppose those who</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.800" end="01:11:00.639" style="s2">are doing well at it so even though the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:02.560" style="s2">system is inanimate the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.639" end="01:11:04.510" style="s2">doing well at it or animate so then they</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.560" end="01:11:06.909" style="s2">take those people out which is we see</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.510" end="01:11:09.159" style="s2">how Martin Luther King and Gandhi and</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.909" end="01:11:13.030" style="s2">Jesus and etc died people who actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.159" end="01:11:15.690" style="s2">opposed the system of power right and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.030" end="01:11:19.630" style="s2">you end up having a system that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.690" end="01:11:22.440" style="s2">selecting for or is conferring more</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.630" end="01:11:24.820" style="s2">power to those who are good at getting</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.440" end="01:11:27.460" style="s2">more power which ends up meaning who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.820" end="01:11:33.670" style="s2">selecting for conferring power to</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.460" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">sociopathy yeah I I don&#39;t find this part</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.670" end="01:11:39.969" style="s2">of the argument well maybe I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:42.580" style="s2">stuck somewhere doing okay let me be I</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.969" end="01:11:44.020" style="s2">mean I think I&#39;m on your side so I want</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.580" end="01:11:46.870" style="s2">to help make a different part of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.020" end="01:11:49.480" style="s2">case I think a lot of this comes down to</p>

<p begin="01:11:49.480" end="01:11:59.170" style="s2">of nuclear weapons against humans since</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.280" end="01:12:01.570" style="s2">1945 I think that one thing if 9/11 had</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.170" end="01:12:04.750" style="s2">been a nuclear attack rather than a</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.570" end="01:12:07.540" style="s2">weird conventional attack we would know</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.750" end="01:12:11.409" style="s2">where we were in human history and by</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.540" end="01:12:13.600" style="s2">virtue of our luck and our luck alone we</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.409" end="01:12:15.699" style="s2">are completely confused as to how</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.600" end="01:12:18.310" style="s2">perilous the present moment is because</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.699" end="01:12:22.510" style="s2">our luck has been amazing and if you</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.310" end="01:12:24.969" style="s2">believe surprising yeah if you believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.510" end="01:12:28.719" style="s2">that somehow it can&#39;t be luck because</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.969" end="01:12:30.699" style="s2">it&#39;s this good then you believe that</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.719" end="01:12:32.469" style="s2">there&#39;s some unknown principle keeping</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.699" end="01:12:33.489" style="s2">us safe and that you don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.469" end="01:12:36.340" style="s2">name of that principle</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.489" end="01:12:38.829" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s human engine in ingenuity</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.340" end="01:12:42.969" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s some sort of secret</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.829" end="01:12:44.590" style="s2">collective that keeps the world sensible</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.969" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s that markets have tied us all</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.590" end="01:12:48.519" style="s2">together I don&#39;t know what your story is</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:51.719" style="s2">yeah but whatever your story is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.519" end="01:12:54.940" style="s2">wrong and it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously wrong</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.719" end="01:12:56.860" style="s2">right the the idea that we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.940" end="01:13:01.409" style="s2">anything like 9/11 and then we had a</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.860" end="01:13:05.230" style="s2">sudden 9/11 kind of attack is itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.409" end="01:13:08.909" style="s2">paradigm attic that these things with</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.230" end="01:13:12.550" style="s2">which you have no data familiarity I</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.909" end="01:13:15.900" style="s2">mean look there was no suicide bombing</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.550" end="01:13:20.469" style="s2">in the modern world before the 1980s and</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.900" end="01:13:22.989" style="s2">I think this is the point is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.469" end="01:13:24.760" style="s2">generally more advantageous within a</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.989" end="01:13:26.079" style="s2">market to believe that markets are good</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.760" end="01:13:26.440" style="s2">in the world as healthy and things are</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.079" end="01:13:29.139" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.440" end="01:13:31.059" style="s2">I&#39;ll usually do better in academia if I</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.139" end="01:13:32.650" style="s2">say academia is good right which is a</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.059" end="01:13:34.239" style="s2">point that you make if I really</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.650" end="01:13:35.769" style="s2">criticize it heavily I&#39;m gonna get less</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.239" end="01:13:39.340" style="s2">tense this is Peter&#39;s point more than my</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.769" end="01:13:41.289" style="s2">point okay yeah I will usually do better</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.340" end="01:13:42.849" style="s2">in markets if I say they&#39;re awesome and</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.289" end="01:13:44.320" style="s2">do better in a corporation if I say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.849" end="01:13:48.670" style="s2">awesome and so there is kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.320" end="01:13:50.499" style="s2">incentive for optimism about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.670" end="01:13:51.730" style="s2">dominant system if I want to do well in</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.499" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">the dominant system and if I have</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.730" end="01:13:54.789" style="s2">critiques of the dominant system I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:56.559" style="s2">usually going to do less well in it</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.789" end="01:13:58.300" style="s2">which means less power will get</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.559" end="01:14:00.940" style="s2">conferred to those ideas and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.300" end="01:14:04.119" style="s2">kind of a mimetic selection right like</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.940" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">the memes that that do well end up being</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.119" end="01:14:07.869" style="s2">the memes that propagate but do well</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:11.260" style="s2">with an ax current system well look this</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.869" end="01:14:13.300" style="s2">is why I&#39;ve called for a return to</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.260" end="01:14:16.840" style="s2">above-ground nuclear testing because my</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.300" end="01:14:18.489" style="s2">belief is is that we you laugh but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.840" end="01:14:21.670" style="s2">not kidding yeah I mean if we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.489" end="01:14:24.219" style="s2">our amygdalas really engaged with where</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.670" end="01:14:26.079" style="s2">we are this magical thinking which by</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.219" end="01:14:27.429" style="s2">the way I suffer from this magical thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.079" end="01:14:29.650" style="s2">I&#39;m not it&#39;s not something I&#39;m claiming</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.429" end="01:14:33.099" style="s2">everyone else has I have the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.650" end="01:14:34.719" style="s2">nothing too bad can can come that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.099" end="01:14:36.429" style="s2">know I always asked this weird question</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.719" end="01:14:39.070" style="s2">which is how many foreign nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.429" end="01:14:40.929" style="s2">devices are currently on US soil people</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.070" end="01:14:42.639" style="s2">always think about the nukes will have</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.929" end="01:14:43.840" style="s2">to come through an ICBM I&#39;m not at all</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.639" end="01:14:46.300" style="s2">convinced that that would have to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.840" end="01:14:47.389" style="s2">true people just don&#39;t think about these</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.300" end="01:14:50.050" style="s2">things because</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.389" end="01:14:53.300" style="s2">we&#39;ve been in such a rare period of time</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.050" end="01:14:55.150" style="s2">that these things haven&#39;t like everybody</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.300" end="01:14:58.040" style="s2">who&#39;s talked in these terms</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.150" end="01:14:59.540" style="s2">sort of to me like there&#39;s a part of me</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.040" end="01:15:01.550" style="s2">that sounds like okay well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.540" end="01:15:06.250" style="s2">kind of a conversation you have on on a</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.550" end="01:15:08.659" style="s2">dorm floor during a bull session like</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.250" end="01:15:11.570" style="s2">grown-ups realize that something is</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.659" end="01:15:12.739" style="s2">keeping the world together which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.570" end="01:15:15.949" style="s2">funny right because it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.739" end="01:15:20.510" style="s2">saying grown-ups have bought into</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.949" end="01:15:22.250" style="s2">magical thinking exactly yeah and so by</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.510" end="01:15:24.739" style="s2">the way a lot of the people that I think</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.250" end="01:15:26.630" style="s2">of as being the smartest most</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.739" end="01:15:29.090" style="s2">interesting people have not bought into</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.630" end="01:15:31.489" style="s2">this magical thinking what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.090" end="01:15:35.119" style="s2">is is that those people have been pushed</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.489" end="01:15:37.010" style="s2">out of the institutions that form this</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.119" end="01:15:38.900" style="s2">sort of weird conversation that I refer</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.010" end="01:15:42.710" style="s2">to as the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.900" end="01:15:45.230" style="s2">and the depopulation of dissenters like</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.710" end="01:15:50.150" style="s2">really serious dissenters from inside</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.230" end="01:15:52.340" style="s2">the institutional complex is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.150" end="01:15:53.630" style="s2">defining features of our age to me but</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.340" end="01:15:56.989" style="s2">something that you can&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.630" end="01:15:59.239" style="s2">commentary on because the commentary</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.989" end="01:16:02.179" style="s2">you&#39;re really looking for is is that</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.239" end="01:16:04.699" style="s2">conversation so what I just try to do is</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.179" end="01:16:06.380" style="s2">to show people that no matter what you</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.699" end="01:16:09.880" style="s2">do the gated institutional narrative</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.380" end="01:16:12.560" style="s2">cannot look at certain very basic facts</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.880" end="01:16:15.710" style="s2">right so you get a very dangerous kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.560" end="01:16:17.750" style="s2">of groupthink there and even if someone</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.710" end="01:16:19.909" style="s2">disagrees with it they have a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.750" end="01:16:22.760" style="s2">incentive to not publicly disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.909" end="01:16:24.440" style="s2">it within that group think only of those</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.760" end="01:16:27.530" style="s2">people I mean this is why we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.440" end="01:16:30.650" style="s2">the portal podcast which is let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.530" end="01:16:32.590" style="s2">honest this is pirate radio yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.650" end="01:16:36.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know why it hasn&#39;t been shut down</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.590" end="01:16:38.239" style="s2">at the moment the best thing that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.320" end="01:16:41.540" style="s2">gated institutional conversation has</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.239" end="01:16:45.710" style="s2">going for it is that all of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.540" end="01:16:48.290" style="s2">interesting people are simply humans and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.710" end="01:16:50.090" style="s2">you can destroy any human reputationally</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.290" end="01:16:51.889" style="s2">and so the cheapest thing to do is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.090" end="01:16:54.260" style="s2">to kill anybody right but just as</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.889" end="01:16:56.719" style="s2">somebody starts to accumulate mindshare</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.260" end="01:16:59.659" style="s2">the gated institutional narrative goes</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.719" end="01:17:01.310" style="s2">into into hyperdrive and it just starts</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.659" end="01:17:03.380" style="s2">pumping out</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.310" end="01:17:06.620" style="s2">fear uncertainty in doubt which is the</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.380" end="01:17:08.750" style="s2">you know Fudd is the major tool for</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.620" end="01:17:11.770" style="s2">destroying an individual&#39;s ability to</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.750" end="01:17:16.280" style="s2">communicate reality yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.770" end="01:17:19.550" style="s2">something I think about is the people</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.280" end="01:17:23.240" style="s2">who went through what happened in Syria</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.550" end="01:17:25.580" style="s2">recently or say collapse in Libya or</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.240" end="01:17:29.630" style="s2">wherever where you had an actual pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.580" end="01:17:30.770" style="s2">developed nation that didn&#39;t also expect</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.630" end="01:17:33.650" style="s2">that it was going to go through war and</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.770" end="01:17:35.570" style="s2">collapse and then it did I bet that if</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.650" end="01:17:37.730" style="s2">we talk to those people they would have</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.570" end="01:17:39.260" style="s2">a very different intuition for the state</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.730" end="01:17:41.720" style="s2">of the fragility here because they</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.260" end="01:17:43.610" style="s2">actually have first-person experience</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.720" end="01:17:44.570" style="s2">it&#39;s something that seemed really stable</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.610" end="01:17:47.000" style="s2">and like it wasn&#39;t going to collapse</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.570" end="01:17:49.370" style="s2">actually did and most of us haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.000" end="01:17:51.590" style="s2">actually been through anything like a</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.370" end="01:17:53.150" style="s2">collapse in our life and we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.590" end="01:17:57.050" style="s2">good intuition for things that are only</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.150" end="01:18:00.020" style="s2">in history books and so this is a place</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.050" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">where our intuition by itself like our</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.020" end="01:18:04.340" style="s2">intuition is informed by our experience</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:07.460" style="s2">but our experience is very short right</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.340" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">and if we study past civilizations one</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.460" end="01:18:10.790" style="s2">of the things we know and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:14.240" style="s2">can read Tainter in the collapse of</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.790" end="01:18:16.640" style="s2">complex societies or you know other kind</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.240" end="01:18:18.410" style="s2">of good insights on how civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.640" end="01:18:21.350" style="s2">collapse works but none of the previous</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.410" end="01:18:23.030" style="s2">civilizations are still here like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.350" end="01:18:24.710" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the important things to</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.030" end="01:18:26.810" style="s2">get is that they go through a life cycle</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.710" end="01:18:29.690" style="s2">and that they mostly collapse for</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.810" end="01:18:31.250" style="s2">self-induced reasons and that even if</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.690" end="01:18:33.950" style="s2">someone else overtook them oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.250" end="01:18:35.780" style="s2">the group that overtook them was smaller</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.950" end="01:18:37.730" style="s2">than rivals that they had fended off</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.780" end="01:18:39.380" style="s2">previously because they had already</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.730" end="01:18:41.330" style="s2">started going through institutional</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.380" end="01:18:43.670" style="s2">collapse or civilizational collapse and</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.330" end="01:18:45.470" style="s2">if we look across all of them there are</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.670" end="01:18:47.300" style="s2">some things we can generalize about what</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.470" end="01:18:49.430" style="s2">leads to civilizational collapse but I</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.300" end="01:18:50.690" style="s2">think the difference now versus any of</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.430" end="01:18:53.450" style="s2">those other times is that due to</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.690" end="01:18:54.890" style="s2">globalization yeah in some ways the US</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.450" end="01:18:56.570" style="s2">and China are different civilizations</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.890" end="01:19:00.200" style="s2">but both of them would fail without each</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.570" end="01:19:01.880" style="s2">other currently and like we don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.200" end="01:19:03.500" style="s2">our own computational substrate we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.880" end="01:19:05.000" style="s2">make our own lots of things right like</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.500" end="01:19:07.580" style="s2">they don&#39;t do their own fundamental well</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.000" end="01:19:11.030" style="s2">but the size of the hope of the but the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.580" end="01:19:14.750" style="s2">architects of many of these systems</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.030" end="01:19:17.630" style="s2">believed that a kind of eakin</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.750" end="01:19:21.920" style="s2">Sonic mutually assured destruction yeah</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.630" end="01:19:24.440" style="s2">it was the best way of producing hang</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.920" end="01:19:26.300" style="s2">that&#39;s been true you well so I was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.440" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">bring up the case of Europe so one of</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.300" end="01:19:31.490" style="s2">the arguments for the European</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.440" end="01:19:33.350" style="s2">experiment is that you Europe is</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.490" end="01:19:36.770" style="s2">actually arguably the world&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.350" end="01:19:38.830" style="s2">dangerous region people are very</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.770" end="01:19:45.110" style="s2">competent and their long-standing</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.830" end="01:19:47.900" style="s2">rivalries and hatreds and you had some</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.110" end="01:19:50.330" style="s2">desire to create something that seems</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.900" end="01:19:53.000" style="s2">impossible which is a United States of</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.330" end="01:19:54.680" style="s2">Europe and nobody was gonna sign up for</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.000" end="01:19:58.040" style="s2">that so how do you do that while you</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.680" end="01:20:00.380" style="s2">back you back them into a financial</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.040" end="01:20:02.210" style="s2">union without political Union you give</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.380" end="01:20:04.700" style="s2">them their ability the ability to issue</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.210" end="01:20:08.450" style="s2">their own debt but not an ability to</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.700" end="01:20:13.040" style="s2">print it their currencies and then you</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.450" end="01:20:15.710" style="s2">wait for the collapse to come and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.040" end="01:20:19.130" style="s2">your hope in this storyline anyway you</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.710" end="01:20:21.080" style="s2">create a Federation which becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.130" end="01:20:24.380" style="s2">political Federation the United States</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.080" end="01:20:26.270" style="s2">of Europe is created because of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.380" end="01:20:29.030" style="s2">sovereign debt crisis and we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.270" end="01:20:31.940" style="s2">went through that which I believe was it</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.030" end="01:20:34.220" style="s2">was was sort of a sought after outcome</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.940" end="01:20:37.960" style="s2">which is maybe hopefully people will</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.220" end="01:20:39.800" style="s2">print their own their own debt and</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.960" end="01:20:41.570" style="s2">they&#39;ll issue debt and they won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.800" end="01:20:43.760" style="s2">able to print their own currencies in</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.570" end="01:20:46.670" style="s2">order to inflate their way out of it</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.760" end="01:20:51.050" style="s2">ergo something positive will have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.670" end="01:20:53.740" style="s2">happen that seems to me to be also a</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.050" end="01:20:57.140" style="s2">recipe for disaster and that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.740" end="01:20:59.390" style="s2">architects of these plans seemingly died</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.140" end="01:21:01.670" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s on autopilot not</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.390" end="01:21:03.710" style="s2">understanding you know I&#39;ve seen this in</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.670" end="01:21:06.860" style="s2">the in terms of certain US policies</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.710" end="01:21:09.290" style="s2">where people create a policy for reasons</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.860" end="01:21:10.940" style="s2">that nobody&#39;s really understanding and a</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.290" end="01:21:13.220" style="s2">short time later nobody even knows why</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.940" end="01:21:15.140" style="s2">the policy was created the real reason</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.220" end="01:21:17.150" style="s2">and to begin with do you see that this</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.140" end="01:21:20.120" style="s2">kind of a world I think that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.150" end="01:21:21.830" style="s2">one of the meaningful dynamics in</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.120" end="01:21:24.260" style="s2">institutional decay and in</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.830" end="01:21:26.330" style="s2">civilizational decay is that a new</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.260" end="01:21:28.580" style="s2">civilization is formed coming out</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.330" end="01:21:30.620" style="s2">coming out of a war or after a migration</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.580" end="01:21:36.590" style="s2">or through a famine or after like some</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.620" end="01:21:38.330" style="s2">really developing yeah and to really be</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.590" end="01:21:40.360" style="s2">able to build something new took real</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.330" end="01:21:42.710" style="s2">capacities what you would call the</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.360" end="01:21:45.290" style="s2">contact with the unforgiving right like</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.710" end="01:21:48.920" style="s2">real empirical capacities and just</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.290" end="01:21:50.000" style="s2">loaded my lingo sir a bit yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.920" end="01:21:54.140" style="s2">think that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.000" end="01:21:56.990" style="s2">lingo because like the I can&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.140" end="01:21:59.900" style="s2">lie to physics and have it reward me for</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.990" end="01:22:01.550" style="s2">it right like either I can grow corn or</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.900" end="01:22:03.260" style="s2">I can&#39;t grow corn either I can win it a</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.550" end="01:22:05.930" style="s2">war or I can&#39;t but there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.260" end="01:22:08.120" style="s2">situation and so oftentimes when we go</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.930" end="01:22:11.200" style="s2">from non more time where the generals</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.120" end="01:22:13.340" style="s2">are politicians to war time where the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.200" end="01:22:15.050" style="s2">politician generals who maybe suck at</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.340" end="01:22:16.310" style="s2">war start losing battles and we cycle</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.050" end="01:22:17.480" style="s2">through looking for ones who are good at</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.310" end="01:22:20.780" style="s2">it then we get some who are actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.480" end="01:22:24.200" style="s2">good at war those difficult situations</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.780" end="01:22:25.580" style="s2">select for real empirical capacity but</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.200" end="01:22:27.140" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have those difficult</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.580" end="01:22:28.850" style="s2">situations then you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.140" end="01:22:30.200" style="s2">selecting for who can do politics best</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.850" end="01:22:31.820" style="s2">which means convince everyone of</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.200" end="01:22:33.470" style="s2">something whether it&#39;s true or not well</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.820" end="01:22:37.100" style="s2">this is what I call sharp Minds versus</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.470" end="01:22:38.920" style="s2">sharp elbows yeah and so you have the</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.100" end="01:22:41.060" style="s2">people who are at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.920" end="01:22:44.320" style="s2">figuring out how to do some new</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.060" end="01:22:46.820" style="s2">civilization and those people had some</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.320" end="01:22:48.350" style="s2">capacity to be in direct contact with</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.820" end="01:22:51.590" style="s2">reality and figure stuff out and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.350" end="01:22:53.630" style="s2">oftentimes what they pass on is the</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.590" end="01:22:55.940" style="s2">stuff they figured out but not the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.630" end="01:22:57.680" style="s2">psychology in them and the capacities to</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.940" end="01:22:59.390" style="s2">figure stuff out so the generator</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.680" end="01:23:01.940" style="s2">function of the civilizational models</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.390" end="01:23:04.250" style="s2">lost and so now we start getting copying</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.940" end="01:23:07.640" style="s2">errors and people are hopefully trying</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.250" end="01:23:09.410" style="s2">to at least copy it earnestly so now</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.640" end="01:23:11.570" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a constitution or a set of law</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.410" end="01:23:13.730" style="s2">or a set of market practices or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.570" end="01:23:16.850" style="s2">it is but we don&#39;t really understand how</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.730" end="01:23:18.500" style="s2">we generated that effective thing and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.850" end="01:23:20.660" style="s2">that also means that as the environment</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.500" end="01:23:23.000" style="s2">changes we won&#39;t be able to adapt it</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.660" end="01:23:24.410" style="s2">adequately and that also means that</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.000" end="01:23:26.240" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to know how to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.410" end="01:23:29.240" style="s2">failures of it so then some people</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.240" end="01:23:32.300" style="s2">recognizing that start realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.240" end="01:23:35.350" style="s2">they can do better by defecting on the</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.300" end="01:23:38.930" style="s2">system and kind of preying on it then by</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.350" end="01:23:40.040" style="s2">participating with the system and so and</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.930" end="01:23:41.540" style="s2">this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.040" end="01:23:45.740" style="s2">think of as corruption right where they</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.540" end="01:23:47.180" style="s2">can start maximizing their own bonus</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.740" end="01:23:48.740" style="s2">structure or do it back in the or</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.180" end="01:23:50.420" style="s2">whatever and so long as it&#39;s adequately</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.740" end="01:23:52.580" style="s2">hidden they can get away with it and now</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.420" end="01:23:54.050" style="s2">that collapses the civilization even</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.580" end="01:23:56.810" style="s2">further so it goes from loss of</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.050" end="01:23:59.060" style="s2">generator function to copying errors to</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.810" end="01:24:03.380" style="s2">incentive for internal defection and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.060" end="01:24:05.720" style="s2">disinformation and you know like I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.380" end="01:24:07.460" style="s2">that every civilization has faced this a</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.720" end="01:24:08.840" style="s2">loss of intergenerational knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.460" end="01:24:10.190" style="s2">transfer because it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.840" end="01:24:11.630" style="s2">knowledge it&#39;s the generative function</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.190" end="01:24:15.920" style="s2">of how Lahti good it&#39;s also the case</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.630" end="01:24:21.080" style="s2">that real knowledge I think has become</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.920" end="01:24:27.920" style="s2">too dangerous to transmit and the real</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.080" end="01:24:32.150" style="s2">knowledge doesn&#39;t know what the social</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.920" end="01:24:35.810" style="s2">norms are and you know certainly the</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.150" end="01:24:37.550" style="s2">biological world is so disturbing I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.810" end="01:24:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no corner of the biological</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.550" end="01:24:41.420" style="s2">world since you can look at where and</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.440" end="01:24:45.260" style="s2">not come away thinking wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.420" end="01:24:46.940" style="s2">incredibly destroyed and what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.260" end="01:24:48.830" style="s2">seeing right now a situation in which we</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.940" end="01:24:51.470" style="s2">can&#39;t cope with any discussion of</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.830" end="01:24:54.830" style="s2">biology every single attempt to have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.470" end="01:24:56.920" style="s2">real biological discussion given all of</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.830" end="01:24:59.600" style="s2">the social issues that it would bring up</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.920" end="01:25:01.700" style="s2">immediately ends in madness</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.600" end="01:25:04.850" style="s2">I&#39;ve just seen no ability to talk real</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.700" end="01:25:06.860" style="s2">biology in public and so this is the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.850" end="01:25:09.830" style="s2">earliest place where I can see here&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:27:30.739" end="01:27:37.370" style="s2">that was like a mental illness and but</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.630" end="01:27:39.140" style="s2">so they their definition of something</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.370" end="01:27:41.660" style="s2">that translated to schizophrenia the</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.140" end="01:27:44.030" style="s2">first symptom was had negative feelings</p>

<p begin="01:27:44.030" end="01:27:47.900" style="s2">might take a while to show up and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.219" end="01:27:49.550" style="s2">what I think happens is that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.900" end="01:27:51.650" style="s2">dominant system ends up eating</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.550" end="01:27:53.150" style="s2">psychology and saying that the</p>

<p begin="01:27:53.150" end="01:27:56.450" style="s2">system is healthy psychology and</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.010" end="01:27:59.390" style="s2">anything that is dissenting - it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.450" end="01:28:02.420" style="s2">healthy it ends up beating spirituality</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.390" end="01:28:05.030" style="s2">and virtue and ethics and academia and</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.420" end="01:28:06.860" style="s2">whatever to basically say the the</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.030" end="01:28:08.840" style="s2">behaviors that support the system</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.860" end="01:28:10.699" style="s2">are good so the thinking that supports</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.840" end="01:28:13.400" style="s2">those behaviors is good and anything</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.699" end="01:28:16.040" style="s2">that&#39;s dissenting is bad and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.400" end="01:28:18.170" style="s2">so easy to see it in the Crusades or in</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.040" end="01:28:19.699" style="s2">jihadism or even in Victorian time</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.170" end="01:28:23.420" style="s2">period it&#39;s just very hard for us to see</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.699" end="01:28:24.650" style="s2">it about ourselves now but I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.420" end="01:28:26.690" style="s2">that&#39;s actually like one of these</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.650" end="01:28:28.010" style="s2">fundamental things in terms of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.690" end="01:28:30.679" style="s2">saying like why don&#39;t we have group</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.010" end="01:28:33.560" style="s2">sense-making is because you have us you</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.679" end="01:28:36.080" style="s2">have a self-perpetuating system that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.560" end="01:28:39.429" style="s2">includes the self perpetuation of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.080" end="01:28:43.610" style="s2">memes that support the system I</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.429" end="01:28:45.560" style="s2">understand well look I also have I ask</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.610" end="01:28:48.290" style="s2">it not because I have no ideas why we</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.560" end="01:28:52.810" style="s2">don&#39;t have communal sense making what</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.290" end="01:28:56.540" style="s2">I&#39;m confused by is why we are not more</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.810" end="01:28:58.820" style="s2">successful people in our group and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.540" end="01:29:00.560" style="s2">mean this in a relatively large and</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.820" end="01:29:02.420" style="s2">inclusive sense because you and I come</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.560" end="01:29:04.760" style="s2">from different corners of this large</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.420" end="01:29:08.150" style="s2">collection of people I think people are</p>

<p begin="01:29:18.080" end="01:29:23.989" style="s2">conversation I mean I always liken it a</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.810" end="01:29:27.170" style="s2">bit to the difference between wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.989" end="01:29:29.510" style="s2">and professional wrestling where in the</p>

<p begin="01:30:32.389" end="01:30:39.409" style="s2">most likely yeah well oh I want to start</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.290" end="01:30:42.260" style="s2">by saying I think this is important and</p>

<p begin="01:30:58.400" end="01:31:01.820" style="s2">is really important when we come back to</p>

<p begin="01:31:05.239" end="01:31:10.239" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s like okay so what is the</p>

<p begin="01:31:10.239" end="01:31:16.070" style="s2">that for the most part expressing these</p>

<p begin="01:31:26.090" end="01:31:29.750" style="s2">would be saying things that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.620" end="01:31:32.570" style="s2">almost no in-group that they would be</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.750" end="01:31:36.980" style="s2">aligned with or very very small and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.570" end="01:31:38.690" style="s2">you still end up having that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.980" end="01:31:40.760" style="s2">more selective pressure for the</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.690" end="01:31:42.469" style="s2">individuals to continue to be part of</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.760" end="01:31:44.179" style="s2">institutions even an institutional</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.469" end="01:31:45.440" style="s2">thoughts also doesn&#39;t make sense here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.179" end="01:31:47.420" style="s2">the part that doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.440" end="01:31:51.850" style="s2">and very kind of you to say what you</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.420" end="01:31:55.280" style="s2">just said let&#39;s imagine that you have</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.850" end="01:31:58.010" style="s2">perfect SAT scores you kept your nose</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.280" end="01:32:02.659" style="s2">clean your whole life you&#39;ve gone to</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.010" end="01:32:04.820" style="s2">Harvard and Yale you&#39;ve got a position</p>

<p begin="01:32:04.820" end="01:32:14.360" style="s2">with a column in a major publication if</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.850" end="01:32:21.199" style="s2">that person for example calls me all</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.360" end="01:32:23.239" style="s2">right you know or I don&#39;t know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.199" end="01:32:27.170" style="s2">like I have a Jewish last name I voted</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.239" end="01:32:29.620" style="s2">for Bernie there&#39;s some point where that</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.170" end="01:32:32.270" style="s2">person&#39;s self-esteem I would imagine</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.620" end="01:32:33.690" style="s2">they would be so embarrassed to put</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.270" end="01:32:36.480" style="s2">their life&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.690" end="01:32:40.680" style="s2">compliments at risk by just being</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.480" end="01:32:43.260" style="s2">obviously stupidly wrong like that they</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.680" end="01:32:45.930" style="s2">just there&#39;s there seems to be no bottom</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.260" end="01:32:48.150" style="s2">at the moment okay so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.930" end="01:32:52.050" style="s2">important about obviously stupidly wrong</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.150" end="01:32:55.530" style="s2">I understand obviously stupidly wrong</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.050" end="01:32:58.110" style="s2">when your ability to demonstrate your</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.530" end="01:33:01.469" style="s2">power is to go out in the public square</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.110" end="01:33:03.270" style="s2">and say the dumbest most ridiculous most</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.469" end="01:33:07.980" style="s2">obviously incorrect thing you can think</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.270" end="01:33:10.199" style="s2">of and nobody says a word yeah well one</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.980" end="01:33:13.530" style="s2">of the things I find interesting is you</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.199" end="01:33:15.600" style="s2">know if we ask a question like even</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.530" end="01:33:19.250" style="s2">what&#39;s actually causing coral die-off</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.600" end="01:33:21.630" style="s2">how much of it is temperature versus pH</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.250" end="01:33:23.100" style="s2">versus nitrogen messing up the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.630" end="01:33:25.199" style="s2">phosphorous cycle versus trophic</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.100" end="01:33:27.600" style="s2">cascades right how long do we have</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.199" end="01:33:30.030" style="s2">before the coral die-off what are the</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.600" end="01:33:32.820" style="s2">consequences of that you know like</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.030" end="01:33:34.560" style="s2">really important questions right or what</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.820" end="01:33:36.660" style="s2">are the actual what really happened in</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.560" end="01:33:38.699" style="s2">North Korea like why there was such a</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.660" end="01:33:40.530" style="s2">change just recently and what are the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.699" end="01:33:43.650" style="s2">actual tactical nuclear capabilities</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.530" end="01:33:45.120" style="s2">that they have or or how much leakage</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.650" end="01:33:46.530" style="s2">actually occurred at Fukushima or like</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.120" end="01:33:49.050" style="s2">any of these things nobody knows</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.530" end="01:33:52.160" style="s2">and you&#39;ll hear different narratives and</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.050" end="01:33:54.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll hear kind of equally compelling</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.160" end="01:33:57.989" style="s2">disagreeable narratives on those yeah</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.510" end="01:34:00.660" style="s2">and almost no one has the time or the</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.989" end="01:34:02.850" style="s2">will or the epistemic capacity to really</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.660" end="01:34:04.620" style="s2">figure that out so one point is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.850" end="01:34:06.630" style="s2">sense making is actually hard you have a</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.620" end="01:34:11.130" style="s2">situation in which a lot of these things</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.630" end="01:34:14.610" style="s2">are complex enough and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.130" end="01:34:16.410" style="s2">disinformation that when people try to</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.610" end="01:34:19.110" style="s2">actually figure it out they just get a</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.410" end="01:34:22.560" style="s2">they get a information overwhelm and</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.110" end="01:34:24.090" style="s2">then it&#39;s very hard for them to continue</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.560" end="01:34:25.650" style="s2">so when you&#39;re saying like obviously</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.090" end="01:34:28.590" style="s2">stupid well there aren&#39;t there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.650" end="01:34:31.380" style="s2">of places where people can hold a train</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.590" end="01:34:33.300" style="s2">of thought that seems cogent enough even</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.380" end="01:34:35.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s in direct opposition with</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.300" end="01:34:38.070" style="s2">another cogent train of thought and like</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.880" end="01:34:39.690" style="s2">just the plausible deniability that it</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.070" end="01:34:41.910" style="s2">might be one of the true ones since</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.690" end="01:34:44.910" style="s2">nobody can really sense make seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.910" end="01:34:47.639" style="s2">enough and so this is one of the really</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.910" end="01:34:50.670" style="s2">tricky things is in a world where</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.639" end="01:34:52.739" style="s2">if I have the incentive to dis inform ya</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.670" end="01:34:55.020" style="s2">at various different levels right and</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.739" end="01:34:57.119" style="s2">then I have exponential information tech</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.020" end="01:34:58.980" style="s2">so I can do exponential disinformation</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.119" end="01:35:00.650" style="s2">now this is when I say that the system</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.980" end="01:35:03.150" style="s2">is inanimate I any give this example</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.650" end="01:35:05.429" style="s2">everybody who&#39;s seen Tristan Harris&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.150" end="01:35:07.770" style="s2">stuff will know this but if we think</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.429" end="01:35:11.040" style="s2">about disinformation via the nature son</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.770" end="01:35:13.110" style="s2">Harris is mutual colleague he heads a</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.040" end="01:35:17.340" style="s2">movement called time well-spent and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.110" end="01:35:20.369" style="s2">trying to show you that your attention</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.340" end="01:35:22.230" style="s2">has been effectively weaponized against</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.369" end="01:35:23.580" style="s2">you where the big tech platforms are</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.230" end="01:35:26.460" style="s2">figuring out how to keep your eyeballs</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.580" end="01:35:28.560" style="s2">on their system to your detriment right</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.460" end="01:35:31.260" style="s2">Center for humane technology you can see</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.560" end="01:35:36.110" style="s2">his stuff but like I think I think a lot</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.260" end="01:35:38.340" style="s2">of people know that news stations as</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.110" end="01:35:41.250" style="s2">for-profit companies have to make money</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.340" end="01:35:44.850" style="s2">right and they make money by monetizing</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.250" end="01:35:47.639" style="s2">attention and basically they they sell</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.850" end="01:35:49.530" style="s2">advertising and the advertisers pay more</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.639" end="01:35:52.170" style="s2">the more people who are watching for</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.530" end="01:35:54.780" style="s2">more total minutes so the incentive of</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.170" end="01:35:57.510" style="s2">the news station is to make stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.780" end="01:35:59.489" style="s2">is both inflaming and scary and</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.510" end="01:36:00.929" style="s2">entertaining and whatever it will engage</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.489" end="01:36:04.380" style="s2">people to spend a lot of time watching</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.929" end="01:36:06.060" style="s2">in and to not say things it would not be</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.380" end="01:36:07.710" style="s2">to the advantage of the advertisers that</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.060" end="01:36:10.290" style="s2">can afford to pay for them right so they</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.710" end="01:36:13.050" style="s2">have like they have an incentive to not</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.290" end="01:36:14.969" style="s2">share really complex nuanced things that</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.050" end="01:36:17.429" style="s2">will have most people click off but to</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.969" end="01:36:20.460" style="s2">share things if I see I don&#39;t I really</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.429" end="01:36:21.840" style="s2">don&#39;t let me give you an argument one of</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.460" end="01:36:23.820" style="s2">the things that I say that I think</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.840" end="01:36:25.679" style="s2">people find interesting is is that I</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.820" end="01:36:27.860" style="s2">believe the National Academy of Sciences</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.679" end="01:36:30.719" style="s2">in the National Science Foundation</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.860" end="01:36:32.820" style="s2">effectively conspired against American</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.719" end="01:36:34.560" style="s2">scientists and engineers on behalf of</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.820" end="01:36:39.090" style="s2">scientific and engineering employers</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.560" end="01:36:42.330" style="s2">that&#39;s a fascinating story I shout it in</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.090" end="01:36:44.130" style="s2">the public square now you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.330" end="01:36:46.949" style="s2">asked four times to the National Academy</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.130" end="01:36:48.480" style="s2">of Sciences to discuss this so they are</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.949" end="01:36:50.130" style="s2">certainly taking this quite seriously</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.480" end="01:36:54.060" style="s2">I&#39;ve talked to the actual people who are</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.130" end="01:36:57.150" style="s2">involved with this it is amazingly</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.060" end="01:37:00.270" style="s2">interesting you could sell clicks you</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.150" end="01:37:01.320" style="s2">think you could just get advertisers to</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.270" end="01:37:04.560" style="s2">buy for the clicks</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.320" end="01:37:07.170" style="s2">the story nobody&#39;s gonna run the story</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.560" end="01:37:09.960" style="s2">nobody has run the story in I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.170" end="01:37:12.570" style="s2">more than 20 years it&#39;s sitting there on</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.960" end="01:37:14.430" style="s2">servers I don&#39;t believe that this is all</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.570" end="01:37:16.140" style="s2">being driven by profit I believe that</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.430" end="01:37:19.020" style="s2">there is some force that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.140" end="01:37:21.750" style="s2">understand that keeps the gated</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.020" end="01:37:24.000" style="s2">institutional narrative gated yes I</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.750" end="01:37:25.890" style="s2">think profit is one part of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.000" end="01:37:29.880" style="s2">why I say we have to think of profit as</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.890" end="01:37:32.880" style="s2">one aspect of kind of power or rival</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.880" end="01:37:37.040" style="s2">risk dynamic more largely because it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.880" end="01:37:39.720" style="s2">think government or academia or</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.040" end="01:37:41.190" style="s2">religious or cultural groups or profit</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.720" end="01:37:44.280" style="s2">can all influence the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.190" end="01:37:47.420" style="s2">narrative and information I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.280" end="01:37:51.180" style="s2">there&#39;s an economy of shame and terror</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.420" end="01:37:53.880" style="s2">say more about that I believe that the</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.180" end="01:37:55.590" style="s2">real reason that this works the way it</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.880" end="01:37:59.270" style="s2">does is we have not even gotten to a</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.590" end="01:38:04.220" style="s2">very basic point where it is considered</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.270" end="01:38:08.820" style="s2">acceptable to say I want immigration</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.220" end="01:38:10.740" style="s2">restricted now I point this out because</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.820" end="01:38:15.480" style="s2">I think is very funny most people who</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.740" end="01:38:17.850" style="s2">want immigration restricted enjoy food</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.480" end="01:38:20.010" style="s2">from other cultures they they have</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.850" end="01:38:22.800" style="s2">friends who come from other places they</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.010" end="01:38:24.630" style="s2">enjoy travel there&#39;s nothing xenophobic</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.800" end="01:38:27.210" style="s2">about them in general there is zina</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.630" end="01:38:29.370" style="s2">philic yeah and the idea that you can be</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.210" end="01:38:31.290" style="s2">both as inna philic fascinated and</p>

<p begin="01:41:48.210" end="01:41:54.210" style="s2">in the mid-1970s and once we saw that we</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.840" end="01:41:57.570" style="s2">were engaged in his dirty tricks against</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.210" end="01:41:59.700" style="s2">our own people we were kind of shocked</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.570" end="01:42:01.800" style="s2">and flipped out and the economy wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.700" end="01:42:04.230" style="s2">in great shape and then Ronald Reagan</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.800" end="01:42:07.140" style="s2">came riding in and I think he pardoned</p>

<p begin="01:42:10.470" end="01:42:14.220" style="s2">deep throat and so you had this very</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.570" end="01:42:17.370" style="s2">strange situation that we got this</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.220" end="01:42:19.770" style="s2">reboot during the Reagan years where we</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.370" end="01:42:22.730" style="s2">went back to some sort of more</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.770" end="01:42:26.520" style="s2">traditional more patriotic imagined</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.730" end="01:42:30.630" style="s2">version of our country and my belief is</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.520" end="01:42:33.540" style="s2">that in part when Bill Clinton decided</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.630" end="01:42:35.220" style="s2">that he couldn&#39;t take yet another loss</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.540" end="01:42:37.460" style="s2">to the Republican Party and was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.220" end="01:42:40.890" style="s2">start experimenting with republicanism</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.460" end="01:42:42.810" style="s2">inside of the Democratic Party by that</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.890" end="01:42:45.630" style="s2">point we had two parties that more or</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.810" end="01:42:47.730" style="s2">less were two flavors of the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.630" end="01:42:50.610" style="s2">I refer to that collective as the</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.730" end="01:42:52.970" style="s2">looting party in the looting party the</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.610" end="01:42:58.200" style="s2">neoliberal is the neoconservatives</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.970" end="01:43:01.710" style="s2">sort of intergenerational warfare within</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.200" end="01:43:06.660" style="s2">the country in the US and my take on it</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.710" end="01:43:08.820" style="s2">is that the common ideology is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:06.660" end="01:43:10.770" style="s2">profit had to be found abroad and so you</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.820" end="01:43:14.880" style="s2">had to loosen the bonds to your fellow</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.770" end="01:43:17.190" style="s2">citizens and that&#39;s where all of this</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.880" end="01:43:20.880" style="s2">kind of the market always knows best</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.190" end="01:43:22.740" style="s2">we need to offshore and downsize and</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.880" end="01:43:25.560" style="s2">securitize and what I&#39;ve called the new</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.740" end="01:43:28.740" style="s2">gimmick economy so that right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.560" end="01:43:32.700" style="s2">waking up from the new gimmick economy</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.740" end="01:43:34.770" style="s2">and having never lived in anything</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.700" end="01:43:37.170" style="s2">really authentic unless we&#39;re quite old</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.770" end="01:43:42.000" style="s2">so my belief is is that during that</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.170" end="01:43:44.270" style="s2">period of time there was very Swift</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.000" end="01:43:48.810" style="s2">retribution for anyone who dissented</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.270" end="01:43:51.690" style="s2">famously a prominent trade theorist who</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.810" end="01:43:54.810" style="s2">was talking about the benefits of</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.690" end="01:43:57.390" style="s2">restriction of trade restrictions for</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.810" end="01:43:59.880" style="s2">infant industries let&#39;s say apparently</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.390" end="01:44:01.530" style="s2">got a call from one of the people high</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.880" end="01:44:02.820" style="s2">up in the field say oh you seem to be a</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.530" end="01:44:04.020" style="s2">very bright young man it would be a</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.820" end="01:44:09.620" style="s2">shame if anything happened to your</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.020" end="01:44:16.860" style="s2">career and so this kind of idea</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.620" end="01:44:19.230" style="s2">suppression is the the hallmark well it</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.860" end="01:44:21.390" style="s2">is what I think these two generations</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.230" end="01:44:25.830" style="s2">the baby boomers and the Silent</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.390" end="01:44:28.110" style="s2">Generation may become best known for in</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.830" end="01:44:32.100" style="s2">the future that this was a period in</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.110" end="01:44:34.260" style="s2">which new corrective ideas had to be</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.100" end="01:44:36.120" style="s2">suppressed because of the fragility of</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.260" end="01:44:39.480" style="s2">the system we saw the fragility breakout</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.120" end="01:44:44.610" style="s2">in 2008 we saw have vulnerable we were</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.480" end="01:44:48.270" style="s2">in 2001 and we see that the the whole</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.610" end="01:44:50.580" style="s2">sense making apparatus is breaking down</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.270" end="01:44:52.380" style="s2">from the Trump election so these have</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.580" end="01:44:54.000" style="s2">been the three moments when the gated</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.380" end="01:44:55.590" style="s2">institutional narrative has broken</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.000" end="01:44:58.320" style="s2">because it just got overwhelmed by</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.590" end="01:45:01.800" style="s2">events but other than that the key was</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.320" end="01:45:06.300" style="s2">making sure that people like you or like</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.800" end="01:45:08.880" style="s2">me or like Peter are not mainstream the</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.300" end="01:45:12.780" style="s2">cost of listening to us has to be driven</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.880" end="01:45:16.080" style="s2">to astronomical levels so we have to we</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.780" end="01:45:17.820" style="s2">have to look wild-eyed we have to you</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.080" end="01:45:19.680" style="s2">know they can&#39;t call me uneducated if I</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.820" end="01:45:23.490" style="s2">have a Harvard ph.d which is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.680" end="01:45:24.960" style="s2">funny parts of the system but the idea</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.490" end="01:45:27.240" style="s2">is that you have to say well you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.960" end="01:45:30.690" style="s2">maybe he used to be smart but he&#39;s gone</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.240" end="01:45:31.260" style="s2">fringe so the the social cost and</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.690" end="01:45:33.660" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.260" end="01:45:36.300" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing how effective such small</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.660" end="01:45:39.870" style="s2">amounts of that can be well it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.300" end="01:45:44.820" style="s2">just funny I mean it just there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.870" end="01:45:46.950" style="s2">many hours of audio of us and I was just</p>

<p begin="01:46:25.090" end="01:46:29.800" style="s2">is damaged you can&#39;t be trusted</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.670" end="01:46:31.840" style="s2">you know you and and that&#39;s how that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.800" end="01:46:33.880" style="s2">how this this enforcement is work so you</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.840" end="01:46:36.760" style="s2">ask me the question how does it work to</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.880" end="01:46:39.760" style="s2">keep this in line it&#39;s to trivially easy</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.760" end="01:46:43.600" style="s2">to destroy individuals and my question</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.760" end="01:46:44.830" style="s2">has always been is there a program which</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.600" end="01:46:48.130" style="s2">I have tentatively called</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.830" end="01:46:52.300" style="s2">no living heroes and if you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.130" end="01:46:56.080" style="s2">this riff before Charles Lindbergh who</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.300" end="01:46:59.710" style="s2">was not a great human being almost kept</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.080" end="01:47:01.810" style="s2">the u.s. out of World War two he said</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.710" end="01:47:05.980" style="s2">why is this why is this America&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.810" end="01:47:08.710" style="s2">problem and if you think about it he had</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.980" end="01:47:10.300" style="s2">self minted credibility in that he got</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.710" end="01:47:12.840" style="s2">into a plane and he flew it over an</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.300" end="01:47:16.120" style="s2">ocean solo and became a hero and that</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.840" end="01:47:21.880" style="s2">level of visibility allowed him to</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.120" end="01:47:23.830" style="s2">compete with the state okay I think that</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.880" end="01:47:27.850" style="s2">there was a program after Lindbergh that</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.830" end="01:47:32.650" style="s2">said individuals should not be able to</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.850" end="01:47:35.350" style="s2">amass sufficient mindshare to affect the</p>
<p begin="01:47:32.650" end="01:47:37.390" style="s2">course of government policy and that</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.350" end="01:47:40.090" style="s2">this is a question in my mind is there a</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.390" end="01:47:42.490" style="s2">program that got started that said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.090" end="01:47:44.620" style="s2">gonna wait and see if anything starts to</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.490" end="01:47:46.810" style="s2">bubble up that seems to have integrity</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.620" end="01:47:49.180" style="s2">it seems that mindshare it seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.810" end="01:47:51.880" style="s2">opposed to our policies and if and when</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.180" end="01:47:55.090" style="s2">we find such a thing it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.880" end="01:47:58.570" style="s2">redirected co-opted destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.090" end="01:48:00.610" style="s2">reputationally or made ineffectual and</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.570" end="01:48:04.000" style="s2">the the phrase that I really appreciated</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.610" end="01:48:06.070" style="s2">that was used about Jean Seberg who was</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.000" end="01:48:07.550" style="s2">you know one of Hollywood&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.070" end="01:48:10.250" style="s2">leading ladies at the time</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.550" end="01:48:12.320" style="s2">was we have to cheapen her image yeah</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.250" end="01:48:14.330" style="s2">this is the federal government talking</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.320" end="01:48:17.000" style="s2">about cheapening the image of a</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.330" end="01:48:21.100" style="s2">Hollywood star because she was</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.000" end="01:48:21.100" style="s2">interested in in radical black politics</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.220" end="01:48:26.000" style="s2">sorry Kendra but now China reminds me</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.960" end="01:48:28.550" style="s2">when you were saying if when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.000" end="01:48:30.350" style="s2">biology it&#39;s disturbing when we look at</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.550" end="01:48:32.480" style="s2">history too and we realized that those</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.350" end="01:48:35.960" style="s2">people that did the Crusades were</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.480" end="01:48:37.880" style="s2">genetically identical to us and we think</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.960" end="01:48:39.230" style="s2">about the kind of civilized way that we</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.880" end="01:48:40.520" style="s2">want to think of ourselves that we</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.230" end="01:48:42.170" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do something like have a</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.520" end="01:48:44.480" style="s2">government try and discredit someone but</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.170" end="01:48:48.670" style="s2">then we look at just how we have behaved</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.480" end="01:48:51.500" style="s2">as people throughout most of history and</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.670" end="01:48:56.000" style="s2">it&#39;s been like it&#39;s been pretty</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.500" end="01:48:58.610" style="s2">draconian through most of it and I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.000" end="01:49:01.130" style="s2">we&#39;re at a time where having it more</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.610" end="01:49:03.460" style="s2">hidden has been useful but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.130" end="01:49:05.510" style="s2">mean that it hasn&#39;t still been happening</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.460" end="01:49:07.460" style="s2">well it&#39;s very interesting to me is we</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.510" end="01:49:09.860" style="s2">go from we have these two phases the</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.460" end="01:49:11.720" style="s2">first phase is like you think people are</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.860" end="01:49:13.970" style="s2">still doing that you have an overactive</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.720" end="01:49:16.130" style="s2">imagination then when it&#39;s discovered I</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.970" end="01:49:17.480" style="s2">say what you think that governments</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.130" end="01:49:22.310" style="s2">don&#39;t do this they&#39;ve always done this</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.480" end="01:49:25.190" style="s2">and I&#39;ve always watched as people get</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.310" end="01:49:29.270" style="s2">their cognitive dissonance to zero using</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.190" end="01:49:32.030" style="s2">two totally different mental strategies</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.270" end="01:49:36.050" style="s2">do you find us of course yeah all right</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.030" end="01:49:37.700" style="s2">Daniel assuming that we are in some</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.050" end="01:49:39.860" style="s2">sense breaking out of this narrative</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.700" end="01:49:42.740" style="s2">that&#39;s been imposed institutionally and</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.860" end="01:49:46.070" style="s2">you&#39;re starting to be able to hear new</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.740" end="01:49:50.180" style="s2">voices is there an opportunity in some</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.070" end="01:49:56.890" style="s2">way to start hacking our way into a less</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.180" end="01:50:00.970" style="s2">rival risk well let me try it again</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.890" end="01:50:04.930" style="s2">sorry for getting a little bit of gas I</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.970" end="01:50:04.930" style="s2">also had a little bit of guest</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.940" end="01:50:13.380" style="s2">all right Danno so if we agree that</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.730" end="01:50:15.480" style="s2">there is something a little bit bizarre</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.380" end="01:50:17.640" style="s2">about the extent to which there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.480" end="01:50:20.430" style="s2">discipline in this gated institutional</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.640" end="01:50:23.640" style="s2">narrative and it&#39;s been hard to get kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.430" end="01:50:26.160" style="s2">of a different message out to people</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.640" end="01:50:28.260" style="s2">that they need to start exploring new</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.160" end="01:50:31.530" style="s2">systems of organization may be beyond</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.260" end="01:50:34.800" style="s2">market democracy who knows what what are</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.530" end="01:50:39.870" style="s2">the most hopeful systems that we</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.800" end="01:50:42.150" style="s2">currently have to use they can be used</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.870" end="01:50:43.770" style="s2">to build even better systems and how do</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.150" end="01:50:47.550" style="s2">we get that message out where do you see</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.770" end="01:50:51.060" style="s2">the hope in trying to confront the real</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.550" end="01:50:54.710" style="s2">problems we face to find and exit into</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.060" end="01:50:54.710" style="s2">our our next stage of human development</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.800" end="01:51:01.590" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been talking about where there</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.500" end="01:51:03.360" style="s2">is incentive for disinformation or</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.590" end="01:51:05.610" style="s2">information suppression or narrative</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.360" end="01:51:08.940" style="s2">suppression the the last chunk of things</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.610" end="01:51:11.100" style="s2">you were sharing regarding shames kind</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.940" end="01:51:14.370" style="s2">of a narrative warfare tool so a way I</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.100" end="01:51:15.930" style="s2">think of it and say there was a group</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.370" end="01:51:18.210" style="s2">that seemed like it didn&#39;t have power of</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.930" end="01:51:21.210" style="s2">one kind then it tries to find power of</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.210" end="01:51:22.710" style="s2">some other kind so reconfiguring in</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.210" end="01:51:29.640" style="s2">groups competing with whatever tools</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.710" end="01:51:31.650" style="s2">they can against out groups but imagine</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.640" end="01:51:33.240" style="s2">if we could create a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.650" end="01:51:35.160" style="s2">there was no incentive for</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.240" end="01:51:36.750" style="s2">disinformation I&#39;ll talk about in a</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.160" end="01:51:38.970" style="s2">moment how I think we could do that and</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.750" end="01:51:40.680" style="s2">not just no incentive for disinformation</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.970" end="01:51:44.130" style="s2">but also no incentive for information</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.680" end="01:51:47.610" style="s2">withholding and something pretty unique</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.130" end="01:51:52.470" style="s2">about humans is how good we are being</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.610" end="01:51:54.510" style="s2">able to add intention to signal lie but</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.470" end="01:51:56.640" style="s2">all the subtle versions right which is</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.510" end="01:51:58.080" style="s2">most of the signal that is coming to me</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.640" end="01:51:59.400" style="s2">is just bouncing off of stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.080" end="01:52:02.040" style="s2">reflecting and doesn&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.400" end="01:52:04.020" style="s2">disinformation in it and obviously</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.040" end="01:52:06.540" style="s2">animals have kin of camouflage and</p>
<p begin="01:52:04.020" end="01:52:09.570" style="s2">strategies like that but every time</p>
<p begin="01:52:06.540" end="01:52:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;re communicating we are usually</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.570" end="01:52:14.880" style="s2">communicating towards some intention</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.000" end="01:52:16.620" style="s2">that we have and so I want you to think</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.880" end="01:52:18.690" style="s2">certain things were you thinking those</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.620" end="01:52:20.429" style="s2">things I think will advantage me but</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.690" end="01:52:23.459" style="s2">then to the extent that you take what</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.429" end="01:52:25.499" style="s2">saying as adequately informing you like</p>
<p begin="01:52:23.459" end="01:52:27.900" style="s2">accurately informing you about reality I</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.499" end="01:52:31.650" style="s2">not be right like there&#39;s a discrepancy</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.900" end="01:52:35.579" style="s2">between why I&#39;m communicating to you and</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.650" end="01:52:38.309" style="s2">what would be maximum benefit to you so</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.579" end="01:52:40.199" style="s2">and even if we&#39;re not doing spin and</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.309" end="01:52:42.239" style="s2">Russell conjugation disinformation even</p>
<p begin="01:52:40.199" end="01:52:44.489" style="s2">if it&#39;s just i pianned trade secrets and</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.239" end="01:52:47.340" style="s2">information withholding this lowers our</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.489" end="01:52:49.349" style="s2">coordination capacity to do interesting</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.340" end="01:52:51.179" style="s2">things tremendously and then there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.349" end="01:52:53.099" style="s2">much coordination cost that goes into</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.179" end="01:52:56.999" style="s2">the competition so we say well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.099" end="01:53:00.719" style="s2">imagine and we I think we can say up to</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.999" end="01:53:02.159" style="s2">a tribal scale people did could do I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.719" end="01:53:04.199" style="s2">not saying they always did I don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.159" end="01:53:07.260" style="s2">be romantic people could do a better job</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.199" end="01:53:09.090" style="s2">of accurate information sharing because</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.260" end="01:53:10.679" style="s2">there was less incentive to dis inform</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.090" end="01:53:12.630" style="s2">each other inside of a tribe because it</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.679" end="01:53:13.920" style="s2">would probably get powned out and we</p>
<p begin="01:53:12.630" end="01:53:17.010" style="s2">actually depended on each other pretty</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.920" end="01:53:19.739" style="s2">significantly but the Dunbar limit seems</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.010" end="01:53:21.510" style="s2">to be a pretty hard limit on that kind</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.739" end="01:53:24.780" style="s2">of information check do you mean this</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.510" end="01:53:30.150" style="s2">supposed Dunbar number that is the limit</p>
<p begin="01:53:24.780" end="01:53:32.130" style="s2">of our ancestral mind or group to track</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.150" end="01:53:34.800" style="s2">the number of interactions we have so</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.130" end="01:53:37.679" style="s2">maybe maybe I can keep track of 200 or</p>
<p begin="01:53:34.800" end="01:53:39.749" style="s2">300 people yeah not much more yeah</p>
<p begin="01:53:37.679" end="01:53:43.439" style="s2">whether whether it&#39;s a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="01:53:39.749" end="01:53:44.820" style="s2">or 50 or 200 or whatever it is and you</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.439" end="01:53:46.800" style="s2">know I think we&#39;ve attributed this to</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.820" end="01:53:48.570" style="s2">different things why tribes never got</p>
<p begin="01:53:46.800" end="01:53:50.459" style="s2">beyond a certain scale within a certain</p>
<p begin="01:53:48.570" end="01:53:52.530" style="s2">kind of organization and if they would</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.459" end="01:53:53.610" style="s2">start to they would cleave and then if</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.530" end="01:53:54.959" style="s2">they were going to get larger they had</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.610" end="01:53:58.949" style="s2">to have a different kind of organization</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.959" end="01:54:01.349" style="s2">I think how one thing that we commonly</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.949" end="01:54:03.539" style="s2">think about is that kind of a limit of</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.349" end="01:54:06.510" style="s2">care and tracking right up to that</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.539" end="01:54:08.489" style="s2">number up to 150 people or whatever I</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.510" end="01:54:10.260" style="s2">can actually know everybody pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.489" end="01:54:11.760" style="s2">they can all know me and if I were to</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.260" end="01:54:13.559" style="s2">hurt anybody I&#39;m hurting the people that</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.760" end="01:54:16.619" style="s2">I&#39;ve known for my whole life so</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.559" end="01:54:19.530" style="s2">something like universal interest of</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.619" end="01:54:22.199" style="s2">that group or almost like a communist</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.530" end="01:54:25.050" style="s2">idea makes sense if there&#39;s no anonymous</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.199" end="01:54:26.789" style="s2">people and there&#39;s no very far spaces</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.050" end="01:54:28.439" style="s2">where I can externalize harm I basically</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.789" end="01:54:29.710" style="s2">can&#39;t externalize harm in the social</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.439" end="01:54:31.810" style="s2">Commons when I know everybody</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.710" end="01:54:34.870" style="s2">I also probably can&#39;t lie and have that</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.810" end="01:54:36.460" style="s2">be advantageous I think there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.870" end="01:54:38.050" style="s2">thing which is there&#39;s a communication</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.460" end="01:54:41.200" style="s2">protocol that anyone who has information</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.050" end="01:54:42.550" style="s2">about something within that setting can</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.200" end="01:54:44.500" style="s2">inform a choice</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.550" end="01:54:47.650" style="s2">where that information would be relevant</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.500" end="01:54:48.820" style="s2">that the tribe would be making because</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.650" end="01:54:51.070" style="s2">they can actually communicate with</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.820" end="01:54:53.230" style="s2">everybody fairly easily and if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:54:51.070" end="01:54:55.239" style="s2">really big choice to make everybody can</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.230" end="01:54:58.360" style="s2">sit around a tribal circle and actually</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.239" end="01:54:59.950" style="s2">be able to say something about it and as</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.360" end="01:55:02.590" style="s2">you get larger you just can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.950" end="01:55:07.330" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a strong cleaving</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.590" end="01:55:08.620" style="s2">basis for not wanting to be part of a</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.330" end="01:55:10.180" style="s2">group that would make decisions that</p>
<p begin="01:55:08.620" end="01:55:13.630" style="s2">I&#39;ll be subjected to that I don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.180" end="01:55:15.730" style="s2">any saying unless it&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.630" end="01:55:17.260" style="s2">to do that like we&#39;re gonna have there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.730" end="01:55:19.090" style="s2">a situation where tribal warfare is</p>
<p begin="01:55:17.260" end="01:55:20.380" style="s2">starting to occur more often and so</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.090" end="01:55:22.480" style="s2">having a larger group is really</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.380" end="01:55:23.770" style="s2">important or you know some something</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.480" end="01:55:26.650" style="s2">like that in which case the bonding</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.770" end="01:55:28.900" style="s2">energy exceeds the cleaving energy but</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.650" end="01:55:30.790" style="s2">let&#39;s say that we could actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.900" end="01:55:31.420" style="s2">situation where we had incentive to</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.790" end="01:55:33.940" style="s2">share</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.420" end="01:55:35.830" style="s2">- not this inform and to share accurate</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.940" end="01:55:41.020" style="s2">information with each other and it could</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.830" end="01:55:43.780" style="s2">scale beyond a dunbar size I so now we</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.020" end="01:55:46.030" style="s2">have something where we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:55:43.780" end="01:55:48.400" style="s2">fractal disinformation inside of a</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.030" end="01:55:49.930" style="s2">company we don&#39;t have people competing</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.400" end="01:55:51.760" style="s2">for cancer cures that aren&#39;t sharing</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.930" end="01:55:55.450" style="s2">information with each other I think that</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.760" end="01:55:56.890" style="s2">system would out-compete all the systems</p>
<p begin="01:55:55.450" end="01:55:59.890" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had in terms of innovation</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.890" end="01:56:02.650" style="s2">and in terms of resource utilization</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.890" end="01:56:04.150" style="s2">resource per capita utilization so much</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.650" end="01:56:06.610" style="s2">that if we could do such a thing had</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.150" end="01:56:08.950" style="s2">become the new attractive Basin to which</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.610" end="01:56:11.200" style="s2">civilizations would want to flow and I</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.950" end="01:56:14.020" style="s2">think the limit of Dunbar dynamics were</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.200" end="01:56:16.989" style="s2">communication protocols and I think we</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.020" end="01:56:19.300" style="s2">do have technological capacity and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.989" end="01:56:22.210" style="s2">be I mean both social technologies and</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.300" end="01:56:24.850" style="s2">physical technologies to develop systems</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.210" end="01:56:28.320" style="s2">and and so like this is kind of at the</p>
<p begin="01:56:24.850" end="01:56:33.010" style="s2">heart of it to develop systems where</p>
<p begin="01:56:28.320" end="01:56:34.660" style="s2">there was more incentive to share honest</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.010" end="01:56:41.739" style="s2">information and obviously this is a</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.660" end="01:56:43.600" style="s2">example of anti rivalries where I had my</p>
<p begin="01:56:41.739" end="01:56:45.400" style="s2">well being in your well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.600" end="01:56:51.040" style="s2">wellbeing of the Commons more tightly</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.400" end="01:56:56.410" style="s2">coupled to each other yeah that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.040" end="01:57:01.440" style="s2">first part of it okay so try to figure</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.410" end="01:57:04.750" style="s2">out how to get very large-scale human</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.440" end="01:57:07.960" style="s2">collectives to behave like small scale</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.750" end="01:57:09.670" style="s2">human collectives well it&#39;s yeah if I</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.960" end="01:57:14.440" style="s2">think about two groups of people that</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.670" end="01:57:16.660" style="s2">sounds to me like TripAdvisor where I to</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.440" end="01:57:20.980" style="s2">some country I&#39;ve never been to and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.660" end="01:57:22.990" style="s2">never going back again and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.980" end="01:57:25.510" style="s2">sort of reputational cost that a hotel</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.990" end="01:57:28.600" style="s2">would have had if it had gamed their</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.510" end="01:57:31.120" style="s2">guests so it becomes a bad idea to game</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.600" end="01:57:33.160" style="s2">your guests because you have a</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.120" end="01:57:35.770" style="s2">fractional relationship with the world</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.160" end="01:57:37.720" style="s2">in some sense where somebody has left a</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.770" end="01:57:41.440" style="s2">review it says but you know be careful</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.720" end="01:57:43.930" style="s2">they try to upsell you on the Wi-Fi and</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.440" end="01:57:45.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a scam and here&#39;s how to look out</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.930" end="01:57:47.980" style="s2">for it and suddenly you have got a</p>
<p begin="01:57:45.370" end="01:57:49.420" style="s2">problem if you&#39;re a dishonest actor</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.980" end="01:57:54.400" style="s2">because there is this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.420" end="01:57:57.790" style="s2">reputational game that is</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.400" end="01:57:59.500" style="s2">technologically enabled yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.790" end="01:58:01.180" style="s2">this is why people like blockchain is</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.500" end="01:58:04.840" style="s2">the idea of an uncorruptible ledger is</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.180" end="01:58:06.550" style="s2">that this information and information</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.840" end="01:58:08.620" style="s2">withholding or would be really benefit</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.550" end="01:58:10.330" style="s2">beneficial to the public and any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.620" end="01:58:12.160" style="s2">bad acting does less well with good</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.330" end="01:58:14.080" style="s2">accounting systems I have to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.160" end="01:58:15.250" style="s2">kind of corrupt the accounting in some</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.080" end="01:58:20.440" style="s2">way to be able to have it be</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.250" end="01:58:21.970" style="s2">advantageous and so can we make can we</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.440" end="01:58:23.440" style="s2">make systems that make the accounting</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.970" end="01:58:26.140" style="s2">much better as part of it but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.440" end="01:58:28.270" style="s2">the whole basis because then of course</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.140" end="01:58:29.980" style="s2">you still have incentive to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.270" end="01:58:31.900" style="s2">how to game the game whatever it is as</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.980" end="01:58:34.780" style="s2">long as we still have separate interests</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.900" end="01:58:37.090" style="s2">and the separate interest which is that</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.780" end="01:58:38.680" style="s2">any in group can advantage itself at the</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.090" end="01:58:41.290" style="s2">expense of an out group or any</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.680" end="01:58:42.850" style="s2">individual canta JIT self at the expense</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.290" end="01:58:44.380" style="s2">of other individuals which is grounded</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.850" end="01:58:46.900" style="s2">all the way down to like a private</p>
<p begin="01:58:44.380" end="01:58:49.750" style="s2">balance sheet I do think is an</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.900" end="01:58:52.000" style="s2">inexorable basis of rivalry and I do</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.750" end="01:58:54.450" style="s2">think that rivalry in a world of</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.000" end="01:58:57.430" style="s2">exponential tech does self-terminate and</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.450" end="01:59:00.010" style="s2">given that I don&#39;t think we can stop</p>
<p begin="01:58:57.430" end="01:59:02.230" style="s2">progress of tech I do think we have to</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.010" end="01:59:03.850" style="s2">create fundamentally anti rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.230" end="01:59:07.750" style="s2">systems and I don&#39;t think you can do</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.850" end="01:59:09.580" style="s2">that with capitalism or that or private</p>
<p begin="01:59:07.750" end="01:59:11.470" style="s2">property ownership is the primary basis</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.580" end="01:59:12.730" style="s2">to how we get access to things I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.470" end="01:59:13.990" style="s2">think you can do it with communism or</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.730" end="01:59:16.120" style="s2">socialism or any of the other systems</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.990" end="01:59:17.830" style="s2">we&#39;ve had but I don&#39;t think that if we</p>
<p begin="01:59:16.120" end="01:59:19.960" style="s2">look at how the coordination system of</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.830" end="01:59:22.390" style="s2">cells or organs inside of a body works I</p>
<p begin="01:59:19.960" end="01:59:24.130" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s capitalist or communist</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.390" end="01:59:27.610" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a much more complex way</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.130" end="01:59:30.550" style="s2">of sharing information and provisioning</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.610" end="01:59:34.150" style="s2">resources within the system you know</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.550" end="01:59:36.760" style="s2">this is how the famous anarchist Peter</p>
<p begin="01:59:34.150" end="01:59:39.280" style="s2">Prince Peter Kropotkin got in trouble I</p>
<p begin="01:59:36.760" end="01:59:42.250" style="s2">think he was like kind of an amateur net</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.280" end="01:59:45.640" style="s2">naturalist and he would observe things</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.250" end="01:59:47.530" style="s2">like ant colonies say look look how well</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.640" end="01:59:49.660" style="s2">the ants cooperate and of course he</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.530" end="01:59:52.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that it was a haploid</p>
<p begin="01:59:49.660" end="01:59:54.070" style="s2">diploid system where sisters are more</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.300" end="01:59:56.950" style="s2">closely related to each other than to</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.070" end="02:00:00.520" style="s2">the offspring and you had a you know a</p>

<p begin="02:00:00.520" end="02:00:06.970" style="s2">mimicking some kind of body division</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.270" end="02:00:11.110" style="s2">into soma and germ where your somatic</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.970" end="02:00:13.150" style="s2">cells have no possibility of leaving a</p>

<p begin="02:00:16.000" end="02:00:23.320" style="s2">that can become a fertilized you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.330" end="02:00:26.020" style="s2">egg and embryo I don&#39;t think there is an</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.320" end="02:00:27.580" style="s2">adequate biomimicry example okay and I</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.020" end="02:00:30.700" style="s2">think there&#39;s an important reason why is</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.580" end="02:00:32.320" style="s2">I think that technology creation is</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.700" end="02:00:34.540" style="s2">something that we don&#39;t see happen in</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.320" end="02:00:37.600" style="s2">nature anywhere else and of course</p>
<p begin="02:00:34.540" end="02:00:40.360" style="s2">animals will use a tool but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.600" end="02:00:42.040" style="s2">evolve better tools or to develop better</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.360" end="02:00:46.330" style="s2">tools the way that we develop better</p>
<p begin="02:00:42.040" end="02:00:48.640" style="s2">tools and the distinction of technology</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.330" end="02:00:50.500" style="s2">creation or tool making as a process by</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.640" end="02:00:52.570" style="s2">which new stuff comes to exist as</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.500" end="02:00:54.820" style="s2">opposed to evolution as a process by</p>
<p begin="02:00:52.570" end="02:00:56.290" style="s2">which new stuff comes to exist is at the</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.820" end="02:00:58.360" style="s2">heart of a lot of the things that I</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.290" end="02:01:02.470" style="s2">think about here because I think it</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.360" end="02:01:04.990" style="s2">fundamentally changes our thinking on</p>
<p begin="02:01:02.470" end="02:01:07.090" style="s2">like social Darwinism and why markets</p>
<p begin="02:01:04.990" end="02:01:10.270" style="s2">are kind of a viable or an extra bolide</p>
<p begin="02:01:07.090" end="02:01:10.960" style="s2">eeeh is if we think about evolution as a</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.270" end="02:01:14.230" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="02:01:10.960" end="02:01:17.770" style="s2">by which new things come about defined</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.230" end="02:01:20.950" style="s2">by mutation survival selection and then</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.770" end="02:01:22.480" style="s2">mate selection within an environmental</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.950" end="02:01:29.230" style="s2">nation and of course there&#39;s recursion</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.480" end="02:01:31.360" style="s2">on niche creation in in evolution we see</p>
<p begin="02:01:29.230" end="02:01:34.150" style="s2">rivalry everywhere as you are mentioning</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.360" end="02:01:37.600" style="s2">in like biology there&#39;s a lot of really</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.150" end="02:01:40.690" style="s2">painful things to look at and I think</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.600" end="02:01:43.900" style="s2">we&#39;ve especially since Darwin modeled</p>
<p begin="02:01:40.690" end="02:01:47.530" style="s2">ourselves as apex predators for a long</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.900" end="02:01:49.180" style="s2">time and but I think and I think that we</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.530" end="02:01:51.370" style="s2">actually even reified the theory of</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.180" end="02:01:54.670" style="s2">markets with evolutionary biology to say</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.370" end="02:01:56.560" style="s2">that demand is like a niche and that the</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.670" end="02:01:59.080" style="s2">various versions of a product or a</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.560" end="02:02:01.239" style="s2">service are like mutations and the</p>
<p begin="02:01:59.080" end="02:02:04.810" style="s2">company that survives because it&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.239" end="02:02:07.120" style="s2">to supply the demand well those ideas</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.810" end="02:02:09.219" style="s2">and those technologies make it through</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.120" end="02:02:10.780" style="s2">and then if there&#39;s a couple that are</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.219" end="02:02:12.340" style="s2">mutually good we&#39;re merging would be</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.780" end="02:02:14.650" style="s2">good so you get a merger and acquisition</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.340" end="02:02:18.310" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of like mate dynamics right</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.650" end="02:02:20.620" style="s2">like recombinant work dynamics and this</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.310" end="02:02:23.860" style="s2">is why competition is good and drives</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.620" end="02:02:25.750" style="s2">innovation and same as happens in nature</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.860" end="02:02:27.790" style="s2">I think that&#39;s kind of the way that a</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.750" end="02:02:29.350" style="s2">lot of people think about markets and</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.790" end="02:02:30.820" style="s2">relationship to evolution and I think</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.350" end="02:02:34.050" style="s2">the reason we can&#39;t think about it that</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.820" end="02:02:36.820" style="s2">way and also the reason why we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.050" end="02:02:39.670" style="s2">whether it&#39;s ants or whether it&#39;s cells</p>
<p begin="02:02:36.820" end="02:02:41.770" style="s2">in the body or anything why we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.670" end="02:02:44.710" style="s2">examples of the kinds of coordination in</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.770" end="02:02:47.500" style="s2">nature that will apply to humans is I</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.710" end="02:02:50.170" style="s2">think that the development of technology</p>
<p begin="02:02:47.500" end="02:02:52.180" style="s2">both language and social coordination</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.170" end="02:02:54.640" style="s2">technologies and physical technologies</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.180" end="02:02:57.010" style="s2">but our capacity for abstraction and</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.640" end="02:02:59.080" style="s2">then things that increase our power via</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.010" end="02:03:01.840" style="s2">abstraction as opposed to their power</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.080" end="02:03:05.590" style="s2">increases via some instantiated thing</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.840" end="02:03:09.040" style="s2">like a gene is a fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.590" end="02:03:12.700" style="s2">process because in nature you will see</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.040" end="02:03:14.380" style="s2">rivalry you&#39;ll see obviously one if the</p>
<p begin="02:03:12.700" end="02:03:15.940" style="s2">lion catches the gazelle the gazelle</p>
<p begin="02:03:14.380" end="02:03:18.610" style="s2">dies if the gazelle gets away the lion</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.940" end="02:03:20.170" style="s2">might die right and yet all lions and</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.610" end="02:03:21.700" style="s2">all gazelles are symbiotic with each</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.170" end="02:03:22.870" style="s2">other meaning if there were no lions the</p>
<p begin="02:03:21.700" end="02:03:24.190" style="s2">gazelles might eat themselves to</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.870" end="02:03:24.969" style="s2">extinction if there were no gazelles</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.190" end="02:03:27.699" style="s2">lions mites</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.969" end="02:03:30.729" style="s2">so there&#39;s this process by which micro</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.699" end="02:03:33.130" style="s2">rivalry leads to macro symbiosis and</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.729" end="02:03:34.719" style="s2">both of them evolving supports each</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.130" end="02:03:36.010" style="s2">other to evolve as the Lions get a</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.719" end="02:03:37.869" style="s2">little bit faster they eat more of the</p>
<p begin="02:03:36.010" end="02:03:39.880" style="s2">slower gazelles the faster ones genes</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.869" end="02:03:42.820" style="s2">recombine and you get faster gazelles</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.880" end="02:03:46.479" style="s2">yeah but I mean you know mathematically</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.820" end="02:03:47.409" style="s2">I think the lotka-volterra equations is</p>
<p begin="02:03:46.479" end="02:03:49.539" style="s2">this predator</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.409" end="02:03:52.449" style="s2">so very simple predator prey dynamics</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.539" end="02:03:55.329" style="s2">with like let&#39;s say two species I</p>
<p begin="02:03:52.449" end="02:03:59.170" style="s2">understand how that can be stable right</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.329" end="02:04:00.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand that in the presence</p>
<p begin="02:03:59.170" end="02:04:02.710" style="s2">of exponential tech I mean they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.789" end="02:04:06.099" style="s2">okay that&#39;s so the first thing that I</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.710" end="02:04:09.400" style="s2">got trying to be concrete here is that</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.099" end="02:04:13.239" style="s2">maybe something like the technology of</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.400" end="02:04:16.809" style="s2">reputation might allow us to leverage up</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.239" end="02:04:19.510" style="s2">small group dynamics towards large group</p>
<p begin="02:04:16.809" end="02:04:21.219" style="s2">dynamics the idea that I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.510" end="02:04:26.019" style="s2">know you to know something about your</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.219" end="02:04:29.139" style="s2">reputation I see some hope there but</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.019" end="02:04:31.210" style="s2">then it&#39;s open to reputational warfare I</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.139" end="02:04:35.710" style="s2">think reputation systems will be gamed I</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.210" end="02:04:39.369" style="s2">agree right with it look I&#39;m very think</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.710" end="02:04:42.039" style="s2">about game B yeah not because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.369" end="02:04:47.409" style="s2">understand our need for it is that I</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.039" end="02:04:52.210" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine the system that gets us</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.409" end="02:04:56.610" style="s2">out of our nature and our nature you</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.210" end="02:05:00.929" style="s2">know rivalry abounds within nature</p>
<p begin="02:04:56.610" end="02:05:04.630" style="s2">cooperation it&#39;s found everywhere I</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.929" end="02:05:07.059" style="s2">don&#39;t see a way of getting everything</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.630" end="02:05:10.179" style="s2">towards universal disclosure and</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.059" end="02:05:12.690" style="s2">cooperation but I&#39;m I hear you are one</p>
<p begin="02:05:10.179" end="02:05:15.190" style="s2">of the people who was the farthest along</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.690" end="02:05:19.389" style="s2">thinking about how we might pull this</p>
<p begin="02:05:15.190" end="02:05:21.460" style="s2">off yeah and I know I told you earlier I</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.389" end="02:05:23.260" style="s2">have to apologize for a strange night</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.460" end="02:05:25.570" style="s2">that had me not sleep so operating at</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.260" end="02:05:30.369" style="s2">low capacity so I think I&#39;m less clear</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.570" end="02:05:32.139" style="s2">than ideal but no I want to say a little</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.369" end="02:05:33.579" style="s2">bit more because just saying make large</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.139" end="02:05:35.289" style="s2">groups work like small groups is like</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.579" end="02:05:36.789" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t help at all I want to</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.289" end="02:05:38.739" style="s2">actually say a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.789" end="02:05:40.659" style="s2">how we would do that sure it</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.739" end="02:05:42.309" style="s2">specifically why the tool-making thing</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.659" end="02:05:44.050" style="s2">is such a big deal and why the</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.309" end="02:05:45.670" style="s2">biomimicry examples don&#39;t work because</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.050" end="02:05:51.639" style="s2">it specifically then plays into what</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.670" end="02:05:53.079" style="s2">does have to work the mutation pressures</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.639" end="02:05:55.630" style="s2">that are happening in nature are</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.079" end="02:05:58.059" style="s2">relatively evenly distributed across the</p>
<p begin="02:05:55.630" end="02:06:00.010" style="s2">system we think about mutation survival</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.059" end="02:06:04.860" style="s2">selection and then breeding selection</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.010" end="02:06:08.199" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t get a situation where</p>
<p begin="02:06:04.860" end="02:06:11.139" style="s2">one species gets a thousand x advantage</p>
<p begin="02:06:08.199" end="02:06:12.820" style="s2">in a single quick jump independent of</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.139" end="02:06:16.389" style="s2">all the other ones right the mutation is</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.820" end="02:06:18.039" style="s2">only going to be so big and the mutation</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.389" end="02:06:20.110" style="s2">forces that are happening on the lions</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.039" end="02:06:22.150" style="s2">are also happening on the gazelles right</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.110" end="02:06:24.219" style="s2">so they&#39;re all experiencing gamma rays</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.150" end="02:06:26.710" style="s2">or oxidative stress or copying errors or</p>
<p begin="02:06:24.219" end="02:06:28.150" style="s2">whatever similarly so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.710" end="02:06:31.059" style="s2">and then the other thing is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.150" end="02:06:33.250" style="s2">co selective pressures as as the lion</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.059" end="02:06:34.570" style="s2">gets a little bit faster then the</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.250" end="02:06:36.070" style="s2">gazelles end up getting faster because</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.570" end="02:06:39.369" style="s2">the slower ones get eaten and the faster</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.070" end="02:06:42.579" style="s2">genes recombine and so because of the</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.369" end="02:06:45.550" style="s2">pair because of the even distribution of</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.579" end="02:06:47.139" style="s2">mutation and because of the co selective</p>
<p begin="02:06:45.550" end="02:06:50.079" style="s2">pressures there&#39;s a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.139" end="02:06:52.420" style="s2">cemetry of power that happens right the</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.079" end="02:06:55.239" style="s2">gazelles get away as often or more often</p>
<p begin="02:06:52.420" end="02:06:57.820" style="s2">than the Lions get them and so you only</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.239" end="02:06:59.769" style="s2">get the situation where micro rivalry</p>
<p begin="02:06:57.820" end="02:07:01.809" style="s2">leads to macro symbiosis when you have</p>
<p begin="02:06:59.769" end="02:07:04.239" style="s2">and also the situation of metastability</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.809" end="02:07:06.940" style="s2">of an ecosystem when you have something</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.239" end="02:07:10.150" style="s2">like a cemetry of power within the</p>

<p begin="02:07:36.460" end="02:07:42.250" style="s2">this works up to a point I mean part of</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.210" end="02:07:44.409" style="s2">the problem is is that gazelles are not</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.250" end="02:07:49.869" style="s2">the only thing that dying on Lions that</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.409" end="02:07:53.300" style="s2">Lions dine on right well and furthermore</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.869" end="02:07:55.939" style="s2">you know lions are not the only even</p>

<p begin="02:07:55.939" end="02:08:03.519" style="s2">hierarchy one lion in 20 hyenas is not a</p>

<p begin="02:08:12.340" end="02:08:16.070" style="s2">interacting and that&#39;s what I mean you</p>
<p begin="02:08:14.749" end="02:08:17.809" style="s2">have meta stability of the whole</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.070" end="02:08:19.459" style="s2">ecosystem not stability because some</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.809" end="02:08:21.499" style="s2">species will die off and other species</p>

<p begin="02:08:23.900" end="02:08:29.119" style="s2">is a parallelism between lion and lion</p>

<p begin="02:08:54.110" end="02:08:59.300" style="s2">making was us consciously understanding</p>

<p begin="02:09:13.639" end="02:09:18.199" style="s2">that made us increase our predatory</p>

<p begin="02:09:18.199" end="02:09:21.769" style="s2">environment could become resilient to</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.090" end="02:09:25.099" style="s2">our increase per date of capacity and</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.769" end="02:09:26.900" style="s2">that was the beginning of a curve that</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.099" end="02:09:29.570" style="s2">has you know started to vertical eyes</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.900" end="02:09:32.389" style="s2">exponentially recently but because of</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.570" end="02:09:35.090" style="s2">that tool making we could put on clothes</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.389" end="02:09:36.979" style="s2">and go to the Arctic and become the apex</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.090" end="02:09:37.969" style="s2">predator there in a way that the lion or</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.979" end="02:09:40.550" style="s2">the cheetah couldn&#39;t leave its</p>
<p begin="02:09:37.969" end="02:09:42.380" style="s2">environment we could we could go become</p>
<p begin="02:09:40.550" end="02:09:44.749" style="s2">the apex predator in every environment</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.380" end="02:09:46.280" style="s2">and over hunt the environments and then</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.749" end="02:09:47.929" style="s2">when we would over hunt an environment</p>
<p begin="02:09:46.280" end="02:09:50.420" style="s2">rather than have our population come to</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.929" end="02:09:51.920" style="s2">steady-state we could go move to and</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.420" end="02:09:53.329" style="s2">start over hunting in other environment</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.920" end="02:09:55.670" style="s2">and then figure out a grow culture</p>
<p begin="02:09:53.329" end="02:09:58.820" style="s2">that&#39;s super different than every other</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.670" end="02:10:01.369" style="s2">animal and so you don&#39;t have a situation</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.820" end="02:10:02.900" style="s2">anywhere in nature where like a single</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.369" end="02:10:05.000" style="s2">lion could do that much damn</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.900" end="02:10:06.739" style="s2">to its environment but you do have a</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.000" end="02:10:08.300" style="s2">situation where a single person like a</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.739" end="02:10:11.060" style="s2">Putin or a Trump or whatever could do</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.300" end="02:10:13.730" style="s2">massive damage because of Technology 2</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.060" end="02:10:16.280" style="s2">the total biosphere you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:10:13.730" end="02:10:18.290" style="s2">situation where a single cancer cell can</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.280" end="02:10:20.330" style="s2">propagate cancer genes instantly to the</p>
<p begin="02:10:18.290" end="02:10:21.800" style="s2">whole system it&#39;s gonna affect the cells</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.330" end="02:10:23.449" style="s2">around it which have a chance to then</p>
<p begin="02:10:21.800" end="02:10:25.850" style="s2">correct it there&#39;s a lot of corrective</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.449" end="02:10:29.750" style="s2">mechanism so the exponential tech</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.850" end="02:10:34.040" style="s2">increases our leverage so much that if</p>
<p begin="02:10:29.750" end="02:10:36.350" style="s2">we that individuals and small groups</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.040" end="02:10:37.909" style="s2">have the capacity to influence the rest</p>
<p begin="02:10:36.350" end="02:10:39.860" style="s2">of the human space but also the bio</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.909" end="02:10:42.739" style="s2">space in a way that nothing else has so</p>
<p begin="02:10:39.860" end="02:10:45.770" style="s2">there is no example anywhere in biology</p>
<p begin="02:10:42.739" end="02:10:47.989" style="s2">of a system that can that has the kind</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.770" end="02:10:52.460" style="s2">of asymmetry relative to its whole</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.989" end="02:10:56.420" style="s2">environment that we have so yeah if I</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.460" end="02:10:58.810" style="s2">understand correctly I mean the slight</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.420" end="02:11:02.050" style="s2">adjustment I would I would give is that</p>
<p begin="02:10:58.810" end="02:11:05.140" style="s2">orcas get you part of the way there</p>
<p begin="02:11:02.050" end="02:11:08.000" style="s2">because they&#39;re a broadly distributed</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.140" end="02:11:09.800" style="s2">apex predator they occur in southern</p>
<p begin="02:11:08.000" end="02:11:14.150" style="s2">northern seas they have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.800" end="02:11:15.739" style="s2">different strategies the thing that that</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.150" end="02:11:18.170" style="s2">you&#39;re coupling it to which I think is</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.739" end="02:11:22.310" style="s2">very interesting is that nobody has seen</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.170" end="02:11:24.770" style="s2">a 10,000 fold increase in Orca</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.310" end="02:11:27.530" style="s2">efficiency as a predator so it may be a</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.770" end="02:11:29.330" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t because as they start eating</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.530" end="02:11:30.920" style="s2">too many of the fish then they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.330" end="02:11:34.520" style="s2">keep breeding you know I understood that</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.920" end="02:11:36.020" style="s2">point so my my point is that you said</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.520" end="02:11:37.100" style="s2">you were trying to indicate that you</p>
<p begin="02:11:36.020" end="02:11:39.560" style="s2">could just keep changing your</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.100" end="02:11:41.120" style="s2">environment like your clothing becomes a</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.560" end="02:11:43.040" style="s2">microclimate so that you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.120" end="02:11:45.469" style="s2">become the eight the the polar bear is</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.040" end="02:11:47.719" style="s2">no longer the a prick apex predator of</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.469" end="02:11:50.659" style="s2">the Arctic right and you could make the</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.719" end="02:11:52.040" style="s2">argument that the Orca is not the apex</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.659" end="02:11:54.920" style="s2">predator of the Seas because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.040" end="02:11:56.570" style="s2">the seas and I think the example there</p>
<p begin="02:11:54.920" end="02:11:58.699" style="s2">is just to think of an ocean trawler</p>
<p begin="02:11:56.570" end="02:12:00.110" style="s2">with a mile long drift net and the</p>
<p begin="02:11:58.699" end="02:12:02.570" style="s2">number of fish it pulls up compared to</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.110" end="02:12:04.340" style="s2">an orca and you realize that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:02.570" end="02:12:06.110" style="s2">model ourselves as apex predators that</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.340" end="02:12:07.880" style="s2">are competing with others to see who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.110" end="02:12:09.650" style="s2">maximally dominant with that much power</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.880" end="02:12:13.699" style="s2">without either story this is a very</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.650" end="02:12:16.400" style="s2">interesting point and I think the idea</p>
<p begin="02:12:13.699" end="02:12:20.600" style="s2">that we are without precedent</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.400" end="02:12:22.610" style="s2">many of us accept we don&#39;t know of any</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.600" end="02:12:24.250" style="s2">other species that has language ability</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.610" end="02:12:27.020" style="s2">to coordinate the way we do all those</p>
<p begin="02:12:24.250" end="02:12:29.360" style="s2">certain social species from African dogs</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.020" end="02:12:30.710" style="s2">to orcas to what have you you know are</p>
<p begin="02:12:29.360" end="02:12:32.780" style="s2">pretty impressive and their ability to</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.710" end="02:12:35.600" style="s2">coordinate in one form or another so</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.780" end="02:12:38.659" style="s2">what I hear you is saying is the tool</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.600" end="02:12:41.810" style="s2">use and the extended phenotype if you</p>
<p begin="02:12:38.659" end="02:12:43.850" style="s2">will to use Richard Darwin&#39;s concept</p>
<p begin="02:12:41.810" end="02:12:46.190" style="s2">like for example these microphones are</p>
<p begin="02:12:43.850" end="02:12:48.440" style="s2">part of our extended phenotype because</p>
<p begin="02:12:46.190" end="02:12:52.699" style="s2">they are tools that allow us to do</p>
<p begin="02:12:48.440" end="02:12:55.460" style="s2">something yeah okay that changes the</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.699" end="02:12:57.830" style="s2">picture and it also ends up introducing</p>
<p begin="02:12:55.460" end="02:12:59.480" style="s2">both a fundamental thing about the</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.830" end="02:13:01.699" style="s2">problem and the solution I&#39;d recommend</p>
<p begin="02:12:59.480" end="02:13:03.170" style="s2">tell me about the solution okay and then</p>
<p begin="02:13:01.699" end="02:13:05.030" style="s2">tell me about the problem I want to have</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.170" end="02:13:07.370" style="s2">well which order would be better</p>
<p begin="02:13:05.030" end="02:13:16.280" style="s2">logically I just I would love to get to</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.370" end="02:13:19.489" style="s2">the positive uplifting yesterday so so</p>
<p begin="02:13:16.280" end="02:13:21.370" style="s2">we can say that what&#39;s particularly a</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.489" end="02:13:23.630" style="s2">primary thing that&#39;s particularly unique</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.370" end="02:13:26.239" style="s2">adaptively about homo sapiens</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.630" end="02:13:28.340" style="s2">yeah is our capacity for technique right</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.239" end="02:13:30.350" style="s2">our capacity for tool and that social</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.340" end="02:13:33.760" style="s2">tools like language and democracy and</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.350" end="02:13:36.469" style="s2">but also physical tools and they are all</p>
<p begin="02:13:33.760" end="02:13:38.630" style="s2">abstract pattern replicators rather than</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.469" end="02:13:41.210" style="s2">instantiated pattern replicators right</p>
<p begin="02:13:38.630" end="02:13:44.060" style="s2">so it memes rather than genes so you</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.210" end="02:13:46.940" style="s2">could say that what humans selected for</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.060" end="02:13:48.679" style="s2">our genetic selected for mimetics our</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.940" end="02:13:51.770" style="s2">genetic selected for radical</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.679" end="02:13:54.679" style="s2">neuroplasticity and the capacity to have</p>

<p begin="02:13:54.679" end="02:14:01.040" style="s2">that could change our capacity without</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.270" end="02:14:04.190" style="s2">needing hardware upgrades and so and I</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.040" end="02:14:07.070" style="s2">would argue that this is partly why we</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.190" end="02:14:08.390" style="s2">have such a long period of neoteny right</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.070" end="02:14:10.659" style="s2">why we have such a long period of being</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.390" end="02:14:14.210" style="s2">totally helpless on the outside is</p>
<p begin="02:14:10.659" end="02:14:15.980" style="s2">because I&#39;m gonna give up on trying to</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.210" end="02:14:17.150" style="s2">get you to redefine the words that are</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.980" end="02:14:19.460" style="s2">going to cause people to have to go to</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.150" end="02:14:21.020" style="s2">their dictionaries I think one of the</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.460" end="02:14:25.969" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;ve said about</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.020" end="02:14:28.159" style="s2">this podcast is that we made me miss</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.969" end="02:14:30.420" style="s2">speak we may use language improperly but</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.159" end="02:14:31.920" style="s2">we should at least play with it and</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.420" end="02:14:34.110" style="s2">people to look things up on their own</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.920" end="02:14:35.610" style="s2">hey I only was doing that because I</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.110" end="02:14:37.500" style="s2">listened to the half-hour thing that you</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.610" end="02:14:39.900" style="s2">said did say you&#39;re gonna let people go</p>
<p begin="02:14:37.500" end="02:14:42.810" style="s2">look at their dictionary yep so I bring</p>
<p begin="02:14:39.900" end="02:14:43.230" style="s2">this rule you&#39;re playing me against me I</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.810" end="02:14:45.060" style="s2">love it</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.230" end="02:14:48.179" style="s2">all right so an extended period of</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.060" end="02:14:49.860" style="s2">neoteny go on yeah so we&#39;re embryonic on</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.179" end="02:14:52.410" style="s2">the outside meaning we&#39;re helpless for a</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.860" end="02:14:53.940" style="s2">super long time compared to anything and</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.410" end="02:14:55.350" style="s2">obviously there are some animals like</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.940" end="02:14:57.000" style="s2">birds that are more helpless than other</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.350" end="02:15:00.660" style="s2">ones for longer periods but nothing like</p>
<p begin="02:14:57.000" end="02:15:03.179" style="s2">us but we don&#39;t if we came hardwired how</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.660" end="02:15:04.350" style="s2">to be fit to our environment that would</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.179" end="02:15:06.540" style="s2">make any sense because we change our</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.350" end="02:15:09.840" style="s2">environment so fast most creatures</p>
<p begin="02:15:06.540" end="02:15:12.179" style="s2">emerged evolved to fit an environmental</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.840" end="02:15:13.650" style="s2">niche but as niche creators as</p>
<p begin="02:15:12.179" end="02:15:16.170" style="s2">significant as we are both because we</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.650" end="02:15:18.090" style="s2">moved places then you know like this is</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.170" end="02:15:19.949" style="s2">not an evolved environment and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.090" end="02:15:22.020" style="s2">that adaptive for me to throw Spears but</p>
<p begin="02:15:19.949" end="02:15:24.440" style="s2">I do need to be good at texting so we</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.020" end="02:15:26.489" style="s2">had to come to be able to learn language</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.440" end="02:15:28.199" style="s2">whether I&#39;m learning English or Mandarin</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.489" end="02:15:31.080" style="s2">whether I&#39;m learning spear-throwing or</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.199" end="02:15:34.679" style="s2">texting or whatever and so what I would</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.080" end="02:15:37.290" style="s2">say is that essential to human nature is</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.679" end="02:15:40.260" style="s2">the depth of nurture capacity relative</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.290" end="02:15:42.719" style="s2">to other species and so when I look at</p>
<p begin="02:15:40.260" end="02:15:44.550" style="s2">the thing we call human nature I look at</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.719" end="02:15:46.980" style="s2">how much I think the social sciences</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.550" end="02:15:50.280" style="s2">don&#39;t factor that there is Oba quit is</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.980" end="02:15:52.500" style="s2">conditioning that we&#39;re doing the social</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.280" end="02:15:54.750" style="s2">science within that is Rubik what is</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.500" end="02:15:56.190" style="s2">conditioning and there are outliers that</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.750" end="02:15:58.170" style="s2">are actually relevant that aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.190" end="02:15:59.610" style="s2">genetic all right so if I understand you</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.170" end="02:16:02.400" style="s2">correctly and now we&#39;re gonna just</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.610" end="02:16:04.890" style="s2">totally geek out we are the most case</p>
<p begin="02:16:02.400" end="02:16:09.690" style="s2">selective of species that is that we put</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.890" end="02:16:13.440" style="s2">the largest investment into our young we</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.690" end="02:16:16.890" style="s2">delay reproductive maturity for 12 times</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.440" end="02:16:20.070" style="s2">around the Sun seems crazy and therefore</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.890" end="02:16:23.370" style="s2">your point is we&#39;ve got an unparalleled</p>
<p begin="02:16:20.070" end="02:16:25.560" style="s2">opportunity for teaching for adaptation</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.370" end="02:16:27.810" style="s2">because we unlike the wildebeest who has</p>
<p begin="02:16:25.560" end="02:16:29.880" style="s2">to be more or less ready good to go</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.810" end="02:16:30.660" style="s2">almost from the moment of birth minutes</p>
<p begin="02:16:29.880" end="02:16:32.610" style="s2">Yeah right</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.660" end="02:16:37.080" style="s2">the idea is that we are in the luxurious</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.610" end="02:16:39.000" style="s2">position of having a long period of</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.080" end="02:16:41.729" style="s2">development and knowledge transfer</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.000" end="02:16:44.330" style="s2">because we are more about the extended</p>
<p begin="02:16:41.729" end="02:16:46.760" style="s2">phenotype and we look at this anthill</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.330" end="02:16:49.880" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty amazing yeah so what that</p>
<p begin="02:16:46.760" end="02:16:52.219" style="s2">tells me is I look at some outliers on</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.880" end="02:16:54.200" style="s2">both sides of the bell curve of various</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.219" end="02:16:57.219" style="s2">dimensions of the human condition and</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.200" end="02:17:00.920" style="s2">let&#39;s say we take Buddhism for instance</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.219" end="02:17:03.860" style="s2">we have something like three millennia</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.920" end="02:17:08.000" style="s2">of 10,000,000 fluxing give or take</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.860" end="02:17:10.010" style="s2">people who mostly don&#39;t hurt bugs across</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.000" end="02:17:13.700" style="s2">different bioregions and across</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.010" end="02:17:15.020" style="s2">different languages and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.700" end="02:17:17.679" style="s2">significant when we think about the</p>
<p begin="02:17:15.020" end="02:17:20.420" style="s2">inexorability of violence in humans and</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.679" end="02:17:22.730" style="s2">then we look at say the Janjaweed or</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.420" end="02:17:24.110" style="s2">some group of child soldiers where by</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.730" end="02:17:25.940" style="s2">the time someone&#39;s a teenager they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.110" end="02:17:28.160" style="s2">all hacked people apart with machetes I</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.940" end="02:17:30.800" style="s2">think that the human condition can do</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.160" end="02:17:33.410" style="s2">both of those human nature can be</p>
<p begin="02:17:30.800" end="02:17:35.210" style="s2">conditioned to do both of those but then</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.410" end="02:17:38.389" style="s2">I see that we have a system where in</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.210" end="02:17:42.889" style="s2">general them as soon as a tribe figured</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.389" end="02:17:44.990" style="s2">out as soon as a couple tribes were</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.889" end="02:17:48.500" style="s2">competing for resources it was generally</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.990" end="02:17:50.929" style="s2">easier to move than it was to war until</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.500" end="02:17:53.810" style="s2">we had moved everywhere in which case it</p>
<p begin="02:17:50.929" end="02:17:55.880" style="s2">was it started making sense to war and</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.810" end="02:17:57.770" style="s2">then as soon as any tribe militarized as</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.880" end="02:17:58.700" style="s2">every other tribe has to militarize or</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.770" end="02:18:01.700" style="s2">they lose by default</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.700" end="02:18:03.530" style="s2">and the game of power has begun in in</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.700" end="02:18:07.969" style="s2">earnest in that way the human on human</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.530" end="02:18:10.610" style="s2">game and I think we&#39;ve seen that the</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.969" end="02:18:12.770" style="s2">peaceful cultures largely got killed by</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.610" end="02:18:14.330" style="s2">the warring cultures and the warring</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.770" end="02:18:17.060" style="s2">cultures learn from each other how to be</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.330" end="02:18:21.139" style="s2">more successful at it and so the thing</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.060" end="02:18:24.110" style="s2">that we have now is something that has</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.139" end="02:18:26.780" style="s2">emerged through iterations on power</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.110" end="02:18:28.160" style="s2">dynamics and it&#39;s conditioning everyone</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.780" end="02:18:29.840" style="s2">within it and then we do all of our</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.160" end="02:18:31.610" style="s2">social studies within that and say this</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.840" end="02:18:34.190" style="s2">is human nature Wow</p>
<p begin="02:18:31.610" end="02:18:37.219" style="s2">so this is a very weird place to get</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.190" end="02:18:39.200" style="s2">brought back to because I&#39;m I&#39;m on the</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.219" end="02:18:41.020" style="s2">escape branch of our decision tree and</p>
<p begin="02:18:39.200" end="02:18:47.240" style="s2">what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:18:41.020" end="02:18:54.500" style="s2">is possible when you can do better by</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.240" end="02:18:57.679" style="s2">investing in peaceful and kind</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.500" end="02:19:01.389" style="s2">alternatives I don&#39;t know what to call</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.679" end="02:19:04.639" style="s2">exactly but nonviolent alternatives and</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.389" end="02:19:08.929" style="s2">as soon as things become kind of steady</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.639" end="02:19:10.670" style="s2">state zero-sum you start eyeing other</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.929" end="02:19:13.819" style="s2">people those protein sources because</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.670" end="02:19:16.609" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to grow a slice and I</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.819" end="02:19:19.250" style="s2">don&#39;t know how you get out of this in a</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.609" end="02:19:21.529" style="s2">finite world so maybe the idea is that</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.250" end="02:19:24.500" style="s2">you&#39;re you have a concept of escape</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.529" end="02:19:29.949" style="s2">yeah that isn&#39;t physical escape I think</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.500" end="02:19:32.210" style="s2">Malthus was right at the time but wrong</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.949" end="02:19:34.609" style="s2">fundamentally mmm-hmm where he said</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.210" end="02:19:36.500" style="s2">resources are reproducing geometrically</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.609" end="02:19:38.059" style="s2">or humans reproducing geometrically</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.500" end="02:19:39.260" style="s2">resources arithmetic aliso there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.059" end="02:19:42.050" style="s2">either not enough or there&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.260" end="02:19:43.699" style="s2">to be enough certain point well he</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.050" end="02:19:46.370" style="s2">hadn&#39;t got to the point that some</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.699" end="02:19:49.189" style="s2">cultures went into negative population</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.370" end="02:19:51.350" style="s2">amounts in lower birth rates without an</p>
<p begin="02:19:49.189" end="02:19:52.970" style="s2">imposition it&#39;s not just China&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.350" end="02:19:56.149" style="s2">know one child in position that did that</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.970" end="02:19:58.250" style="s2">but we&#39;ve seen birth rates low enough in</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.149" end="02:20:00.260" style="s2">some of the Nordic countries and in</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.250" end="02:20:01.880" style="s2">Japan and he hadn&#39;t got to the point of</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.260" end="02:20:04.340" style="s2">seeing the phenomena that bring that</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.880" end="02:20:07.580" style="s2">about or the ability to recycle</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.340" end="02:20:09.800" style="s2">effectively and which means not a linear</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.580" end="02:20:11.660" style="s2">materials economy so I&#39;m starting is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:20:09.800" end="02:20:13.449" style="s2">starting to guess where you&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="02:20:11.660" end="02:20:16.100" style="s2">so if I if I understand you correctly</p>
<p begin="02:20:13.449" end="02:20:17.630" style="s2">the idea is that you&#39;re going to look at</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.100" end="02:20:20.540" style="s2">all of the places we&#39;ve been a little</p>
<p begin="02:20:17.630" end="02:20:24.069" style="s2">bit sloppy like recycling wasn&#39;t a place</p>
<p begin="02:20:20.540" end="02:20:27.319" style="s2">that we put too much attention and</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.069" end="02:20:31.609" style="s2">increasingly as we understand that stuff</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.319" end="02:20:34.550" style="s2">is limited we we have more of a reason</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.609" end="02:20:37.939" style="s2">to be careful about our land use rare</p>
<p begin="02:20:34.550" end="02:20:40.460" style="s2">rare resources I think I get that part</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.939" end="02:20:45.080" style="s2">of it then you have another idea here</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.460" end="02:20:48.590" style="s2">about development is kind of unused and</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.080" end="02:20:50.210" style="s2">we could do something far greater and</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.590" end="02:20:54.890" style="s2">then you just had another one as</p>
<p begin="02:20:50.210" end="02:20:57.380" style="s2">slipping my brain population oh that we</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.890" end="02:20:59.420" style="s2">would start to see fertility below</p>
<p begin="02:20:57.380" end="02:21:01.460" style="s2">replacement rates so that you would</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.420" end="02:21:03.620" style="s2">actually go into population decline as a</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.460" end="02:21:06.170" style="s2">means of taking pressure off of the</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.620" end="02:21:09.500" style="s2">system yeah so I see the possibility for</p>
<p begin="02:21:06.170" end="02:21:11.810" style="s2">a steady-state population</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.500" end="02:21:15.080" style="s2">that is within the carrying capacity of</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.810" end="02:21:17.360" style="s2">a closed-loop materials economy but that</p>
<p begin="02:21:15.080" end="02:21:20.330" style="s2">is fueled by renewable energy so you</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.360" end="02:21:22.100" style="s2">basically have a finite amount of atoms</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.330" end="02:21:23.510" style="s2">so you circle the atoms you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:21:22.100" end="02:21:24.620" style="s2">finite amount of energy because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.510" end="02:21:26.690" style="s2">getting more energy every day be of a</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.620" end="02:21:28.040" style="s2">finite amount per day and so you have to</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.690" end="02:21:30.920" style="s2">be able to cycle the atoms within the</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.040" end="02:21:32.900" style="s2">energy bandwidths and you&#39;re cycling it</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.920" end="02:21:35.540" style="s2">from one bit pattern into another bit</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.900" end="02:21:37.190" style="s2">pattern right like from one form into</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.540" end="02:21:39.020" style="s2">another form and the forms are stored as</p>
<p begin="02:21:37.190" end="02:21:40.520" style="s2">a bit so you have atoms energy and bits</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.020" end="02:21:42.490" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really have a limited</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.520" end="02:21:46.880" style="s2">number of the bits that you can have and</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.490" end="02:21:48.980" style="s2">so we can have a economy where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.880" end="02:21:51.110" style="s2">getting continuously better but not by</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.980" end="02:21:52.460" style="s2">getting bigger but by getting better we</p>
<p begin="02:21:51.110" end="02:21:54.440" style="s2">continuously make more and more</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.460" end="02:21:55.940" style="s2">interesting things with the same format</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.440" end="02:22:02.060" style="s2">listen you&#39;ve always had the possibility</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.940" end="02:22:06.620" style="s2">of decoupling economic growth from let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.060" end="02:22:09.760" style="s2">say burning fossil fuels we just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.620" end="02:22:14.090" style="s2">gotten around to doing very well okay</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.760" end="02:22:16.640" style="s2">what I&#39;m starting to hear is that you</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.090" end="02:22:20.720" style="s2">believe potentially that maybe we should</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.640" end="02:22:24.500" style="s2">embrace declining populations as a means</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.720" end="02:22:26.470" style="s2">of either and I don&#39;t put words in your</p>
<p begin="02:22:24.500" end="02:22:30.520" style="s2">mouth but I&#39;m just trying to guess ahead</p>
<p begin="02:22:26.470" end="02:22:34.100" style="s2">one possibility is is that we need to</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.520" end="02:22:36.200" style="s2">amplify the people who can live</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.100" end="02:22:38.240" style="s2">peaceably and that maybe the idea is</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.200" end="02:22:43.220" style="s2">that people who can&#39;t live peaceably</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.240" end="02:22:45.320" style="s2">need to be incentivized to maybe have</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.220" end="02:22:47.120" style="s2">fabulous somatic lives but without</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.320" end="02:22:51.590" style="s2">reproducing I don&#39;t know so that we can</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.120" end="02:22:53.330" style="s2">drive certain traits towards zero maybe</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.590" end="02:22:55.040" style="s2">the idea is we just need to take ambient</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.330" end="02:22:57.650" style="s2">pressure off the system and so we need</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.040" end="02:22:59.930" style="s2">to go into a world where eight-billion</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.650" end="02:23:04.370" style="s2">becomes 6,000,000,000 becomes 1 billion</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.930" end="02:23:08.300" style="s2">and we start dropping down again I think</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.370" end="02:23:09.470" style="s2">we see that obviously birth rate is</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.300" end="02:23:13.070" style="s2">higher where there&#39;s poverty and we</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.470" end="02:23:14.990" style="s2">might lose some kids right and so as we</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.070" end="02:23:19.360" style="s2">just get out of abject poverty birth</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.990" end="02:23:23.180" style="s2">rates go down and then as total economic</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.360" end="02:23:26.359" style="s2">quality of life and the choice</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.180" end="02:23:29.229" style="s2">abilities for women and education and</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.359" end="02:23:32.510" style="s2">other things go up we start getting too</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.229" end="02:23:34.729" style="s2">much lower birth rates and no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.510" end="02:23:36.800" style="s2">concerned that the birth rate will just</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.729" end="02:23:41.180" style="s2">collapse forever we&#39;ll come to some</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.800" end="02:23:43.370" style="s2">steady-state birth rates but those are</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.180" end="02:23:46.100" style="s2">happening as a function of increased</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.370" end="02:23:47.390" style="s2">good things increased quality of life so</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.100" end="02:23:50.260" style="s2">in other words if you make the</p>
<p begin="02:23:47.390" end="02:23:53.330" style="s2">opportunity cost for childbearing</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.260" end="02:23:56.899" style="s2">enormous by making sure that let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:23:53.330" end="02:24:01.189" style="s2">females have outrageously great career</p>
<p begin="02:23:56.899" end="02:24:03.109" style="s2">prospects and it starts to become much</p>
<p begin="02:24:01.189" end="02:24:05.300" style="s2">more fulfilling did she doesn&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="02:24:03.109" end="02:24:08.149" style="s2">spend their whole life pregnant well</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.300" end="02:24:11.840" style="s2">look I mean the there&#39;s different issues</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.149" end="02:24:14.000" style="s2">with women not realizing that most of</p>
<p begin="02:24:11.840" end="02:24:16.819" style="s2">their children will survive which is</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.000" end="02:24:19.189" style="s2">happening in the demographic transition</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.819" end="02:24:21.949" style="s2">so people miscalculated for a period of</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.189" end="02:24:24.739" style="s2">time leading to fears about runaway</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.949" end="02:24:26.149" style="s2">population booms so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.739" end="02:24:29.779" style="s2">effect and then there&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.149" end="02:24:31.520" style="s2">about if you give people education if</p>
<p begin="02:24:29.779" end="02:24:33.830" style="s2">you give if you educate women the</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.520" end="02:24:36.260" style="s2">opportunity costs of staying home and</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.830" end="02:24:37.729" style="s2">raising children starts to impress</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.260" end="02:24:41.060" style="s2">itself and so people will have fewer</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.729" end="02:24:43.580" style="s2">children yeah but I think where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.060" end="02:24:45.319" style="s2">where you&#39;re headed is super interesting</p>
<p begin="02:24:43.580" end="02:24:46.460" style="s2">and part maybe it&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="02:24:45.319" end="02:24:50.689" style="s2">that people might find it rather</p>
<p begin="02:24:46.460" end="02:24:53.449" style="s2">disturbing making life awesome for</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.689" end="02:24:57.710" style="s2">females might mean having far fewer</p>
<p begin="02:24:53.449" end="02:24:59.810" style="s2">children yep all right so that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:24:57.710" end="02:25:02.930" style="s2">thing in &#39;shmock did burgers well yeah</p>
<p begin="02:24:59.810" end="02:25:05.390" style="s2">this is so both I mean the Malthusian</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.930" end="02:25:08.149" style="s2">trap right the Malthusian situation is</p>
<p begin="02:25:05.390" end="02:25:10.010" style="s2">both the geometric production</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.149" end="02:25:12.260" style="s2">reproduction of humans and the</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.010" end="02:25:14.569" style="s2">arithmetic reproduction of resources and</p>
<p begin="02:25:12.260" end="02:25:17.029" style="s2">I think neither of those are true</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.569" end="02:25:20.420" style="s2">inexorably true I think we can keep</p>
<p begin="02:25:17.029" end="02:25:21.890" style="s2">cycling the resources and so basically</p>
<p begin="02:25:20.420" end="02:25:25.699" style="s2">we can have a steady-state human</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.890" end="02:25:29.180" style="s2">population within a renewable materials</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.699" end="02:25:31.430" style="s2">economy carrying capacity but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:25:29.180" end="02:25:33.380" style="s2">we&#39;re keep but we keep innovating on</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.430" end="02:25:35.120" style="s2">bits so we keep making more and more</p>
<p begin="02:25:33.380" end="02:25:37.229" style="s2">positive and interesting things so we</p>
<p begin="02:25:35.120" end="02:25:39.210" style="s2">keep getting an increase in quality of</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.229" end="02:25:41.220" style="s2">but not by increasing the quality the</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.210" end="02:25:43.260" style="s2">quantity of the pie and the quantity of</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.220" end="02:25:44.939" style="s2">people consuming it but the quality of</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.260" end="02:25:47.460" style="s2">it well the world of Adams I can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:25:44.939" end="02:25:49.830" style="s2">Bill Gates home in Washington State but</p>
<p begin="02:25:47.460" end="02:25:54.149" style="s2">in the world of bits maybe I can live</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.830" end="02:25:57.030" style="s2">there in my virtual reality and even</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.149" end="02:26:01.410" style="s2">have much more fantastic places and so I</p>
<p begin="02:25:57.030" end="02:26:03.210" style="s2">agree that bits have some ability to</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.410" end="02:26:05.729" style="s2">create wild abundance that goes</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.210" end="02:26:07.080" style="s2">non-rival rest&#39;s but i brought up a very</p>
<p begin="02:26:05.729" end="02:26:09.810" style="s2">different concern which you may be</p>
<p begin="02:26:07.080" end="02:26:12.359" style="s2">familiar with which is abundance can</p>
<p begin="02:26:09.810" end="02:26:14.130" style="s2">kill you if you have if you look out</p>
<p begin="02:26:12.359" end="02:26:16.229" style="s2">these windows and you see all of these</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.130" end="02:26:19.020" style="s2">people engaged in activities without</p>
<p begin="02:26:16.229" end="02:26:19.760" style="s2">being told to do so by a central</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.020" end="02:26:23.220" style="s2">authority</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.760" end="02:26:25.979" style="s2">what is it the ties that together for</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.220" end="02:26:28.109" style="s2">the most parts markets with some amount</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.979" end="02:26:32.189" style="s2">of state control of violence in the form</p>
<p begin="02:26:28.109" end="02:26:34.830" style="s2">of policing okay so now you create</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.189" end="02:26:36.630" style="s2">abundance an abundance has this weird</p>
<p begin="02:26:34.830" end="02:26:38.660" style="s2">effect that it turns private goods and</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.630" end="02:26:40.950" style="s2">services into public goods and services</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.660" end="02:26:43.500" style="s2">where price and value are no longer</p>
<p begin="02:26:40.950" end="02:26:44.550" style="s2">equal and suddenly you have people who</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.500" end="02:26:48.149" style="s2">are producing things that are very</p>
<p begin="02:26:44.550" end="02:26:52.800" style="s2">valuable and can&#39;t get paid right and so</p>
<p begin="02:26:48.149" end="02:26:55.080" style="s2">how do we handle the takeover in this</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.800" end="02:26:57.899" style="s2">hypothetical world where we get to an</p>
<p begin="02:26:55.080" end="02:27:00.000" style="s2">economy of abundance that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:57.899" end="02:27:01.620" style="s2">actually cause a collapse of</p>
<p begin="02:27:00.000" end="02:27:05.550" style="s2">civilization you can you can die from</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.620" end="02:27:07.590" style="s2">abundance though a market can die from</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.550" end="02:27:10.260" style="s2">abundance but I&#39;m not proposing a market</p>
<p begin="02:27:07.590" end="02:27:13.800" style="s2">society I okay so I like that so the</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.260" end="02:27:17.580" style="s2">idea is that we welcome the destruction</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.800" end="02:27:20.939" style="s2">of the markets to be replaced by and</p>
<p begin="02:27:17.580" end="02:27:25.080" style="s2">it&#39;s important to say obviously if I</p>
<p begin="02:27:20.939" end="02:27:27.600" style="s2">have a situation where valuation is at</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.080" end="02:27:29.250" style="s2">least largely proportional to scarcity</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.600" end="02:27:31.950" style="s2">then I have a basis to continue to</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.250" end="02:27:33.660" style="s2">manufacture artificial scarcity and if</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.950" end="02:27:36.840" style="s2">something becomes abundant enough it</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.660" end="02:27:39.210" style="s2">loses value then of course abundance and</p>
<p begin="02:27:36.840" end="02:27:43.020" style="s2">markets don&#39;t go together I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="02:27:39.210" end="02:27:46.729" style="s2">excited about any credible thing that is</p>
<p begin="02:27:43.020" end="02:27:49.070" style="s2">better than markets because markets well</p>

<p begin="02:27:49.070" end="02:27:52.910" style="s2">have been pretty amazing and what they</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.810" end="02:27:56.480" style="s2">produced yeah I&#39;m not gonna criticize</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.910" end="02:27:58.640" style="s2">the illusionary path here to say we can</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.480" end="02:28:01.310" style="s2">argue straightforwardly why this path</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.640" end="02:28:03.050" style="s2">can&#39;t continue why the nature of it self</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.310" end="02:28:04.700" style="s2">trap I agree but the big problem here</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.050" end="02:28:09.040" style="s2">has always been that we have so little</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.700" end="02:28:12.350" style="s2">experience with self terminating our</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.040" end="02:28:14.990" style="s2">rival risk desires well so this is why I</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.350" end="02:28:16.940" style="s2">bring the Buddhists up all right and I</p>
<p begin="02:28:14.990" end="02:28:20.240" style="s2">think the Buddhists got past one part of</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.940" end="02:28:21.740" style="s2">the Dunbar number if we think about it</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.240" end="02:28:24.530" style="s2">we think of a couple of Buddhist</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.740" end="02:28:26.150" style="s2">countries for our listeners at home that</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.530" end="02:28:30.380" style="s2">they can keep in mind while you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:28:26.150" end="02:28:31.940" style="s2">talking about but this mostly they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:28:30.380" end="02:28:34.700" style="s2">have countries anymore there are</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.940" end="02:28:37.160" style="s2">Buddhists in a lot of Southeast Asian</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.700" end="02:28:39.260" style="s2">countries so there are Buddhists in</p>
<p begin="02:28:37.160" end="02:28:41.060" style="s2">India there are Buddhists there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.260" end="02:28:43.760" style="s2">of Buddhists in Nepal</p>
<p begin="02:28:41.060" end="02:28:47.230" style="s2">obviously Tibet was Buddhist before</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.760" end="02:28:49.880" style="s2">Tibetan stopped existing in that form</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.230" end="02:28:51.590" style="s2">but and you know I could bring up Jane&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.880" end="02:28:53.690" style="s2">or others but they&#39;re so few of them</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.590" end="02:28:55.310" style="s2">that it&#39;s a little bit easier to throw</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.690" end="02:28:59.150" style="s2">it out as an outlier but basically</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.310" end="02:29:00.710" style="s2">cultures that were widely peaceful but</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.150" end="02:29:03.590" style="s2">it is important to say the widely</p>
<p begin="02:29:00.710" end="02:29:07.220" style="s2">peaceful ones did largely get either</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.590" end="02:29:09.350" style="s2">killed by warring cultures or somehow</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.220" end="02:29:10.850" style="s2">taken over by them or they became</p>
<p begin="02:29:09.350" end="02:29:13.430" style="s2">warring at a certain point and this is</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.850" end="02:29:16.070" style="s2">why your escape hypothesis which your</p>
<p begin="02:29:13.430" end="02:29:17.840" style="s2">escape hypothesis only works if we can</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.070" end="02:29:20.960" style="s2">make a much better civilization but it</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.840" end="02:29:22.940" style="s2">needs to not have proximity to the thing</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.960" end="02:29:25.280" style="s2">to external sources of rivalry so that</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.940" end="02:29:26.570" style="s2">it can develop I want to say you know</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.280" end="02:29:29.360" style="s2">that one of the reasons I keep pushing</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.570" end="02:29:31.790" style="s2">you on these things is not because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:29:29.360" end="02:29:33.920" style="s2">trying to do a gotcha style interview</p>
<p begin="02:29:31.790" end="02:29:38.090" style="s2">the concern let me just be open about it</p>
<p begin="02:29:33.920" end="02:29:39.710" style="s2">is that there are so few people who are</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.090" end="02:29:42.590" style="s2">thinking who are tempting to think</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.710" end="02:29:46.521" style="s2">rigorously about what we actually are</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.590" end="02:29:51.190" style="s2">and what we must become if we are to</p>
<p begin="02:29:46.521" end="02:29:53.420" style="s2">have a long term future that I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.190" end="02:29:56.060" style="s2">believe that you or somebody was trying</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.420" end="02:29:58.250" style="s2">not to flinch when it comes to a</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.060" end="02:30:00.110" style="s2">description of how we got to this place</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.250" end="02:30:02.779" style="s2">from the arms race that is read of tooth</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.110" end="02:30:05.659" style="s2">and claw we&#39;ve called called nature</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.779" end="02:30:08.869" style="s2">and yet your point is maybe we can hack</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.659" end="02:30:10.760" style="s2">ourselves into a situation with the</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.869" end="02:30:12.939" style="s2">future where with exponential tech as</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.760" end="02:30:16.459" style="s2">you call it we don&#39;t have a future and</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.939" end="02:30:18.229" style="s2">here is the basis for rigorous idealism</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.459" end="02:30:22.909" style="s2">and hope and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.229" end="02:30:28.310" style="s2">to tease out no great yeah I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.909" end="02:30:31.249" style="s2">that we are inexorably rival hrus can we</p>
<p begin="02:30:28.310" end="02:30:34.100" style="s2">take this weirdly into the the realm in</p>
<p begin="02:30:31.249" end="02:30:37.310" style="s2">which it is hardest to imagine that we</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.100" end="02:30:41.149" style="s2">are not rival risks we sense sex as the</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.310" end="02:30:43.189" style="s2">precursor to reproduction the floor is</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.149" end="02:30:44.930" style="s2">yours sir okay</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.189" end="02:30:49.399" style="s2">this is going to make the conversation</p>
<p begin="02:30:44.930" end="02:30:56.140" style="s2">weird no no I&#39;m look I think that where</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.399" end="02:30:58.850" style="s2">you&#39;re heading let me rephrase this</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.140" end="02:31:01.430" style="s2">every branch of the decision tree has</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.850" end="02:31:03.890" style="s2">gotten hyper weird and anybody who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:31:01.430" end="02:31:06.020" style="s2">looking at the fact that there is no non</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.890" end="02:31:08.329" style="s2">weird branch of the decision tree is</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.020" end="02:31:11.409" style="s2">missing the story of who we are and what</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.329" end="02:31:15.169" style="s2">time it is in human history so I think</p>
<p begin="02:31:11.409" end="02:31:17.930" style="s2">to not explore the weird to not dream</p>
<p begin="02:31:15.169" end="02:31:22.069" style="s2">about what might be is the least</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.930" end="02:31:24.079" style="s2">responsible least adult thing we can do</p>
<p begin="02:31:22.069" end="02:31:25.510" style="s2">if we don&#39;t dream and we don&#39;t explore</p>
<p begin="02:31:24.079" end="02:31:28.039" style="s2">the weird we&#39;re doomed</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.510" end="02:31:32.829" style="s2">yeah all right with that the floor is</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.039" end="02:31:32.829" style="s2">yours okay</p>
<p begin="02:31:34.170" end="02:31:38.490" style="s2">I wanted to go somewhere with Buddhism</p>
<p begin="02:31:36.540" end="02:31:40.680" style="s2">and why not an extra blue rival race and</p>
<p begin="02:31:38.490" end="02:31:42.420" style="s2">that then if they were to actually get</p>
<p begin="02:31:40.680" end="02:31:44.130" style="s2">the other side of the dunmer number</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.420" end="02:31:45.600" style="s2">which is not just getting care beyond</p>
<p begin="02:31:44.130" end="02:31:48.180" style="s2">the Dunbar number which they could do</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.600" end="02:31:50.340" style="s2">through abstract empathy but also the</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.180" end="02:31:51.570" style="s2">ability to calculate and coordinate</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.340" end="02:31:54.450" style="s2">which they couldn&#39;t because they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:31:51.570" end="02:31:58.050" style="s2">have the tech to do it and I&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="02:31:54.450" end="02:32:01.200" style="s2">gonna say we can get something like abs</p>
<p begin="02:31:58.050" end="02:32:02.430" style="s2">oh well okay I&#39;ll do this X thing into</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.200" end="02:32:06.720" style="s2">Buddhism thing together cuz actually go</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.430" end="02:32:08.970" style="s2">together I think we get something like a</p>
<p begin="02:32:06.720" end="02:32:11.640" style="s2">certain level of empathy up to the</p>
<p begin="02:32:08.970" end="02:32:13.260" style="s2">Dunbar number just through mere neuron</p>
<p begin="02:32:11.640" end="02:32:14.880" style="s2">type effects through the fact that I</p>
<p begin="02:32:13.260" end="02:32:16.740" style="s2">know these people they know me we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.880" end="02:32:17.880" style="s2">lived together if they&#39;re hurting I am</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.740" end="02:32:21.150" style="s2">gonna see it because they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:32:17.880" end="02:32:23.340" style="s2">somewhere far away okay and similarly</p>
<p begin="02:32:21.150" end="02:32:25.260" style="s2">I&#39;m less likely to pollute in an area</p>
<p begin="02:32:23.340" end="02:32:26.430" style="s2">I&#39;m in then through an industrial supply</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.260" end="02:32:29.100" style="s2">chain that pollutes somewhere that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:32:26.430" end="02:32:31.800" style="s2">not so just a proximity where the cause</p>
<p begin="02:32:29.100" end="02:32:33.689" style="s2">and effect has a feedback loop as we</p>
<p begin="02:32:31.800" end="02:32:35.280" style="s2">start to get to much larger scales where</p>
<p begin="02:32:33.689" end="02:32:36.660" style="s2">I haven&#39;t a cause and there&#39;s an effect</p>
<p begin="02:32:35.280" end="02:32:38.250" style="s2">but I don&#39;t get a feedback loop on it</p>
<p begin="02:32:36.660" end="02:32:42.150" style="s2">the broken open feedback loop is a</p>
<p begin="02:32:38.250" end="02:32:45.120" style="s2">problem so I think the Buddhists were</p>
<p begin="02:32:42.150" end="02:32:47.010" style="s2">able to Train abstract empathy not just</p>
<p begin="02:32:45.120" end="02:32:49.800" style="s2">empathy for the people who I see hurting</p>
<p begin="02:32:47.010" end="02:32:52.410" style="s2">but empathy for all sentient beings</p>
<p begin="02:32:49.800" end="02:32:54.510" style="s2">throughout time and space right feeling</p>
<p begin="02:32:52.410" end="02:32:56.160" style="s2">their connectedness with them that the</p>
<p begin="02:32:54.510" end="02:32:58.680" style="s2">nature of the vows of the Bodhisattva</p>
<p begin="02:32:56.160" end="02:33:02.010" style="s2">and they&#39;re not the only one right this</p>
<p begin="02:32:58.680" end="02:33:03.300" style="s2">is different religions have tried to do</p>
<p begin="02:33:02.010" end="02:33:05.460" style="s2">this but it&#39;s an example of a group</p>
<p begin="02:33:03.300" end="02:33:09.900" style="s2">succeeding at it where they were able to</p>
<p begin="02:33:05.460" end="02:33:11.130" style="s2">have a sense of positive coupling of my</p>
<p begin="02:33:09.900" end="02:33:13.380" style="s2">well-being in the well-being of another</p>
<p begin="02:33:11.130" end="02:33:15.630" style="s2">rather than inverse coupling they get</p>
<p begin="02:33:13.380" end="02:33:18.630" style="s2">ahead and it&#39;s decreasing my ability to</p>
<p begin="02:33:15.630" end="02:33:20.670" style="s2">get ahead what they the other side of</p>
<p begin="02:33:18.630" end="02:33:22.439" style="s2">the Dunbar number was not just who we</p>
<p begin="02:33:20.670" end="02:33:25.229" style="s2">care about but also our ability to</p>
<p begin="02:33:22.439" end="02:33:26.760" style="s2">coordinate and I don&#39;t think they were</p>
<p begin="02:33:25.229" end="02:33:29.340" style="s2">able to figure out coordination</p>
<p begin="02:33:26.760" end="02:33:31.470" style="s2">mechanisms that are adequately effective</p>
<p begin="02:33:29.340" end="02:33:34.650" style="s2">at scale okay I think if we do both of</p>
<p begin="02:33:31.470" end="02:33:38.900" style="s2">those things we can make a fundamentally</p>
<p begin="02:33:34.650" end="02:33:42.150" style="s2">different kind of civilization and</p>
<p begin="02:33:38.900" end="02:33:44.700" style="s2">rivalry mostly comes down to today</p>
<p begin="02:33:42.150" end="02:33:46.710" style="s2">private balance sheets which is I can</p>
<p begin="02:33:44.700" end="02:33:47.760" style="s2">get ahead economically and that money</p>
<p begin="02:33:46.710" end="02:33:49.439" style="s2">equals option</p>
<p begin="02:33:47.760" end="02:33:51.660" style="s2">for most of the things that I want</p>
<p begin="02:33:49.439" end="02:33:53.490" style="s2">alright and I can get ahead economically</p>
<p begin="02:33:51.660" end="02:33:55.080" style="s2">independent of you getting ahead and</p>
<p begin="02:33:53.490" end="02:33:57.210" style="s2">even at the expense of you getting ahead</p>
<p begin="02:33:55.080" end="02:34:01.590" style="s2">or the expense of the Commons right and</p>
<p begin="02:33:57.210" end="02:34:04.590" style="s2">so my near-term incentive can oftentimes</p>
<p begin="02:34:01.590" end="02:34:07.350" style="s2">be a long-term disadvantage to others of</p>
<p begin="02:34:04.590" end="02:34:08.880" style="s2">the whole so now this basis of where my</p>

<p begin="02:34:15.810" end="02:34:20.970" style="s2">increasing coordination costs keeps you</p>

<p begin="02:34:24.569" end="02:34:30.930" style="s2">how we deal with the balance sheet part</p>
<p begin="02:34:26.580" end="02:34:34.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a few things right now for me to</p>
<p begin="02:34:30.930" end="02:34:36.450" style="s2">have access to stuff I have to mostly</p>
<p begin="02:34:34.260" end="02:34:38.580" style="s2">with a few exceptions possess the stuff</p>
<p begin="02:34:36.450" end="02:34:41.700" style="s2">right so possession and access are</p>
<p begin="02:34:38.580" end="02:34:43.649" style="s2">coupled and if I possess something I</p>
<p begin="02:34:41.700" end="02:34:45.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be using it I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="02:34:43.649" end="02:34:47.010" style="s2">reserving the optionality to use it the</p>
<p begin="02:34:45.630" end="02:34:48.479" style="s2">drill that sits in my garage that I</p>
<p begin="02:34:47.010" end="02:34:49.890" style="s2">might not have used in a couple years</p>
<p begin="02:34:48.479" end="02:34:53.040" style="s2">but at least it&#39;s convenient that when I</p>
<p begin="02:34:49.890" end="02:34:54.870" style="s2">wanted it&#39;s there right but me</p>
<p begin="02:34:53.040" end="02:34:56.340" style="s2">possessing something means that I have</p>
<p begin="02:34:54.870" end="02:34:59.399" style="s2">access to it and means you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:34:56.340" end="02:35:01.439" style="s2">access to it and so with a finite amount</p>
<p begin="02:34:59.399" end="02:35:03.630" style="s2">of stuff the more stuff you possess the</p>
<p begin="02:35:01.439" end="02:35:07.800" style="s2">less stuff I have access to rival risk</p>
<p begin="02:35:03.630" end="02:35:09.810" style="s2">basis but we all know library type</p>
<p begin="02:35:07.800" end="02:35:10.979" style="s2">examples or shopping carts where if I</p>
<p begin="02:35:09.810" end="02:35:13.200" style="s2">have enough shopping carts of the</p>
<p begin="02:35:10.979" end="02:35:14.580" style="s2">grocery store for peak demand time I</p>
<p begin="02:35:13.200" end="02:35:15.899" style="s2">don&#39;t have to bring my own shopping cart</p>
<p begin="02:35:14.580" end="02:35:17.760" style="s2">which would be a pain in the ass and</p>
<p begin="02:35:15.899" end="02:35:20.850" style="s2">would require 10,000 shopping carts per</p>
<p begin="02:35:17.760" end="02:35:23.760" style="s2">grocery store rather than 300 everybody</p>
<p begin="02:35:20.850" end="02:35:25.200" style="s2">bringing them so what matters is you</p>
<p begin="02:35:23.760" end="02:35:27.600" style="s2">having access to the shopping cart</p>
<p begin="02:35:25.200" end="02:35:30.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t decrease my access and we start</p>
<p begin="02:35:27.600" end="02:35:33.240" style="s2">to see a potential for this if we think</p>
<p begin="02:35:30.390" end="02:35:35.760" style="s2">about something like an uber and then we</p>
<p begin="02:35:33.240" end="02:35:37.470" style="s2">think about self-driving eibar that then</p>
<p begin="02:35:35.760" end="02:35:40.140" style="s2">has a blockchain that disintermediate</p>
<p begin="02:35:37.470" end="02:35:42.479" style="s2">saat being a central company and being a</p>
<p begin="02:35:40.140" end="02:35:44.160" style="s2">commonwealth resource where those were</p>
<p begin="02:35:42.479" end="02:35:46.200" style="s2">you having access to it doesn&#39;t decrease</p>
<p begin="02:35:44.160" end="02:35:48.870" style="s2">my access so we&#39;re not rival risks</p>
<p begin="02:35:46.200" end="02:35:50.279" style="s2">anymore but then we take the next step</p>
<p begin="02:35:48.870" end="02:35:52.380" style="s2">and say if you having access to</p>
<p begin="02:35:50.279" end="02:35:53.790" style="s2">transportation then also allows you to</p>
<p begin="02:35:52.380" end="02:35:57.210" style="s2">go to the maker studio that you have</p>
<p begin="02:35:53.790" end="02:35:59.130" style="s2">access to to the science studio to the</p>
<p begin="02:35:57.210" end="02:36:01.290" style="s2">educational places to the art studios</p>
<p begin="02:35:59.130" end="02:36:03.060" style="s2">where you then have more</p>
<p begin="02:36:01.290" end="02:36:04.771" style="s2">access to be creative but the things</p>
<p begin="02:36:03.060" end="02:36:06.180" style="s2">that you create you aren&#39;t creating for</p>
<p begin="02:36:04.771" end="02:36:08.190" style="s2">you to get more money and get ahead</p>
<p begin="02:36:06.180" end="02:36:09.480" style="s2">because you already have access to all</p>
<p begin="02:36:08.190" end="02:36:11.400" style="s2">the things that you want and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:36:09.480" end="02:36:13.620" style="s2">differentiate yourself by getting stuff</p>
<p begin="02:36:11.400" end="02:36:15.990" style="s2">you differentiate yourself by the things</p>
<p begin="02:36:13.620" end="02:36:17.250" style="s2">that you offer because you already have</p>
<p begin="02:36:15.990" end="02:36:19.021" style="s2">access to stuff so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:36:17.250" end="02:36:22.670" style="s2">fundamentally different motive structure</p>
<p begin="02:36:19.021" end="02:36:25.290" style="s2">then you having access to more resources</p>
<p begin="02:36:22.670" end="02:36:29.130" style="s2">creates a richer Commons that I have</p>
<p begin="02:36:25.290" end="02:36:30.870" style="s2">access to so now we go from rival risk</p>
<p begin="02:36:29.130" end="02:36:33.240" style="s2">not just to non rival risk which is</p>
<p begin="02:36:30.870" end="02:36:35.850" style="s2">uncoupled but anti rival risk meaning</p>
<p begin="02:36:33.240" end="02:36:39.660" style="s2">you getting ahead necessarily equals me</p>
<p begin="02:36:35.850" end="02:36:41.040" style="s2">getting ahead and so on when we look at</p>
<p begin="02:36:39.660" end="02:36:43.830" style="s2">getting out of the Malthusian type</p>
<p begin="02:36:41.040" end="02:36:45.180" style="s2">dynamics part of it is that we can</p>
<p begin="02:36:43.830" end="02:36:47.160" style="s2">actually get out of the population</p>
<p begin="02:36:45.180" end="02:36:48.420" style="s2">dynamics part of it is that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:36:47.160" end="02:36:50.760" style="s2">actually get a closed-loop materials</p>
<p begin="02:36:48.420" end="02:36:53.280" style="s2">economy with renewable energy that can</p>
<p begin="02:36:50.760" end="02:36:56.460" style="s2">continue to upcycle and part of it is</p>
<p begin="02:36:53.280" end="02:36:58.680" style="s2">that we can utilize our resources much</p>
<p begin="02:36:56.460" end="02:37:01.170" style="s2">more effectively and much less rivalry</p>
<p begin="02:36:58.680" end="02:37:03.540" style="s2">slee where we start decoupling access</p>
<p begin="02:37:01.170" end="02:37:05.460" style="s2">from possession that&#39;ll start easily in</p>
<p begin="02:37:03.540" end="02:37:06.990" style="s2">some areas be harder in other areas but</p>
<p begin="02:37:05.460" end="02:37:09.510" style="s2">we start with in the areas that it</p>
<p begin="02:37:06.990" end="02:37:11.370" style="s2">happens and so we start getting more and</p>
<p begin="02:37:09.510" end="02:37:13.590" style="s2">more of a situation where I want you to</p>
<p begin="02:37:11.370" end="02:37:15.060" style="s2">have access to more things because as</p>
<p begin="02:37:13.590" end="02:37:16.530" style="s2">you&#39;re more creative than I get access</p>
<p begin="02:37:15.060" end="02:37:21.450" style="s2">to more things that are the results of</p>
<p begin="02:37:16.530" end="02:37:24.690" style="s2">your creativity so we&#39;re so this is an</p>
<p begin="02:37:21.450" end="02:37:26.220" style="s2">example of removing some of the basis of</p>
<p begin="02:37:24.690" end="02:37:29.550" style="s2">rivalry associated with balance sheets</p>
<p begin="02:37:26.220" end="02:37:32.610" style="s2">okay I can go to sex underneath that now</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.550" end="02:37:34.820" style="s2">if you want me to usually go where is</p>
<p begin="02:37:32.610" end="02:37:40.670" style="s2">most natural to take the conversation</p>
<p begin="02:37:34.820" end="02:37:40.670" style="s2">okay I will just try to fall</p>
<p begin="02:37:46.989" end="02:37:51.789" style="s2">and the problem is if you go to sex</p>
<p begin="02:37:49.550" end="02:37:54.529" style="s2">directly from where you are you are</p>
<p begin="02:37:51.789" end="02:37:58.819" style="s2">describing the value let&#39;s say of</p>
<p begin="02:37:54.529" end="02:38:02.600" style="s2">prostitution which is that people do not</p>
<p begin="02:37:58.819" end="02:38:07.279" style="s2">have to make a commitment to a sexual</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.600" end="02:38:11.479" style="s2">partner many people can have the same</p>
<p begin="02:38:07.279" end="02:38:15.409" style="s2">sexual partner you start to get into all</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.479" end="02:38:22.159" style="s2">of these very funny areas where status</p>
<p begin="02:38:15.409" end="02:38:24.590" style="s2">for example is a very weird commodity do</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.159" end="02:38:26.600" style="s2">I want you to have more status because</p>
<p begin="02:38:24.590" end="02:38:29.000" style="s2">somehow that will give me more status do</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.600" end="02:38:32.529" style="s2">I stop caring about status if there is</p>
<p begin="02:38:29.000" end="02:38:36.260" style="s2">exactly one parcel of land which has a</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.529" end="02:38:39.619" style="s2">unequivocally the best of you is that</p>
<p begin="02:38:36.260" end="02:38:47.750" style="s2">something that I want you to have rather</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.619" end="02:38:53.210" style="s2">than me having it yeah so let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="02:38:47.750" end="02:38:55.670" style="s2">about status for a moment if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:38:53.210" end="02:38:59.180" style="s2">comparing you and me in terms of who has</p>
<p begin="02:38:55.670" end="02:39:02.390" style="s2">more dollars or who&#39;s taller or who can</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.180" end="02:39:06.260" style="s2">run faster or some I can compare us on</p>
<p begin="02:39:02.390" end="02:39:09.369" style="s2">the same metric right now and if status</p>
<p begin="02:39:06.260" end="02:39:11.420" style="s2">is number of followers on Twitter then</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.369" end="02:39:12.470" style="s2">whatever Kim Kardashian&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.420" end="02:39:15.739" style="s2">interesting human being that&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="02:39:12.470" end="02:39:18.289" style="s2">lived and so I I think we know that</p>
<p begin="02:39:15.739" end="02:39:21.619" style="s2">reductionist metrics on status are also</p>
<p begin="02:39:18.289" end="02:39:27.199" style="s2">gamified and inappropriate but if we say</p>
<p begin="02:39:21.619" end="02:39:30.140" style="s2">like MC escher or dolly like what was</p>
<p begin="02:39:27.199" end="02:39:33.710" style="s2">more brilliant art I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.140" end="02:39:35.689" style="s2">meaningless question because they both</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.710" end="02:39:37.850" style="s2">offered something completely novel to</p>
<p begin="02:39:35.689" end="02:39:39.890" style="s2">the world and something meaningful and</p>
<p begin="02:39:37.850" end="02:39:41.390" style="s2">beautiful that neither of the other ones</p>
<p begin="02:39:39.890" end="02:39:43.039" style="s2">offered or could offer and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:39:41.390" end="02:39:47.270" style="s2">compare them because I can&#39;t Metra sized</p>
<p begin="02:39:43.039" end="02:39:49.069" style="s2">them and the reduction of that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.270" end="02:39:51.770" style="s2">the thing is I can&#39;t reduce totally</p>
<p begin="02:39:49.069" end="02:39:53.600" style="s2">unique things to a fungible metric so</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.770" end="02:39:57.699" style="s2">one of the problems I think is actually</p>
<p begin="02:39:53.600" end="02:39:57.699" style="s2">fungibility and metric reduction</p>
<p begin="02:39:58.260" end="02:40:03.720" style="s2">and so if you have status associated</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.069" end="02:40:06.810" style="s2">with unique things that you offer to the</p>
<p begin="02:40:03.720" end="02:40:11.010" style="s2">world awesome I&#39;m not competing with you</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.810" end="02:40:14.550" style="s2">writ large for more status I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="02:40:11.010" end="02:40:16.859" style="s2">people are gonna have a relationship to</p>
<p begin="02:40:14.550" end="02:40:18.359" style="s2">me for the things that I offer and those</p>
<p begin="02:40:16.859" end="02:40:20.729" style="s2">are really the people that I want to</p>
<p begin="02:40:18.359" end="02:40:22.410" style="s2">have a relationship with me and if</p>
<p begin="02:40:20.729" end="02:40:23.910" style="s2">you&#39;re offering things to the world that</p>
<p begin="02:40:22.410" end="02:40:26.160" style="s2">people have a relationship to you for</p>
<p begin="02:40:23.910" end="02:40:27.779" style="s2">and I see that the world is getting</p>
<p begin="02:40:26.160" end="02:40:29.670" style="s2">better as a result of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:40:27.779" end="02:40:31.590" style="s2">offering and I have access to more a</p>
<p begin="02:40:29.670" end="02:40:35.069" style="s2">better world as a result of it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.590" end="02:40:38.460" style="s2">totally stoked on that this is where it</p>
<p begin="02:40:35.069" end="02:40:41.430" style="s2">starts to feel not real to me and no</p>
<p begin="02:40:38.460" end="02:40:43.140" style="s2">yeah okay but let&#39;s but let&#39;s go through</p>
<p begin="02:40:41.430" end="02:40:50.370" style="s2">the show here&#39;s why it sounds not real</p>
<p begin="02:40:43.140" end="02:40:55.590" style="s2">alright I think so do we have a slowing</p>
<p begin="02:40:50.370" end="02:40:58.260" style="s2">in technological progress yes and you</p>
<p begin="02:40:55.590" end="02:41:03.479" style="s2">know less so in some areas than in other</p>
<p begin="02:40:58.260" end="02:41:05.630" style="s2">areas but do we still have exponentially</p>
<p begin="02:41:03.479" end="02:41:07.800" style="s2">growing technology in terms of both</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.630" end="02:41:09.600" style="s2">cumulative amount associated with number</p>
<p begin="02:41:07.800" end="02:41:11.670" style="s2">of people in globalization and in terms</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.600" end="02:41:13.470" style="s2">of just technologies that are still</p>
<p begin="02:41:11.670" end="02:41:15.750" style="s2">continue to grow yes of course we do so</p>
<p begin="02:41:13.470" end="02:41:19.859" style="s2">is it 50 years or hundred years we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:41:15.750" end="02:41:21.810" style="s2">know but I really like I have to think</p>
<p begin="02:41:19.859" end="02:41:24.720" style="s2">of this in a kind of a mythopoetic frame</p>
<p begin="02:41:21.810" end="02:41:27.720" style="s2">that&#39;s how it occurs to me is it as we</p>
<p begin="02:41:24.720" end="02:41:29.370" style="s2">as technology is empowering our choices</p>
<p begin="02:41:27.720" end="02:41:31.740" style="s2">and we are getting something like the</p>
<p begin="02:41:29.370" end="02:41:34.229" style="s2">power of gods you have to have something</p>
<p begin="02:41:31.740" end="02:41:37.350" style="s2">like the love and the wisdom of gods to</p>
<p begin="02:41:34.229" end="02:41:40.439" style="s2">wield that or you self-destruct and so</p>
<p begin="02:41:37.350" end="02:41:43.410" style="s2">when I think about I think about the</p>
<p begin="02:41:40.439" end="02:41:45.420" style="s2">rapture story or the Mayan calendar or</p>
<p begin="02:41:43.410" end="02:41:48.149" style="s2">any of those stories in a metaphoric</p>
<p begin="02:41:45.420" end="02:41:49.920" style="s2">sense as just like let&#39;s say you and I</p>
<p begin="02:41:48.149" end="02:41:51.810" style="s2">were in the Bronze Age and we had just</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.920" end="02:41:52.770" style="s2">seen a larger war than had ever happened</p>
<p begin="02:41:51.810" end="02:41:54.750" style="s2">because there were some new better</p>
<p begin="02:41:52.770" end="02:41:56.670" style="s2">weapons Android shoot further distance</p>
<p begin="02:41:54.750" end="02:41:58.080" style="s2">and there were deserts where there</p>
<p begin="02:41:56.670" end="02:42:00.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t used to be deserts because we had</p>
<p begin="02:41:58.080" end="02:42:02.250" style="s2">got new better axes and saws and had</p>
<p begin="02:42:00.180" end="02:42:04.080" style="s2">been able to cut down more trees and we</p>
<p begin="02:42:02.250" end="02:42:05.970" style="s2">just thought about and we said we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:42:04.080" end="02:42:07.800" style="s2">still developing better weapons and were</p>
<p begin="02:42:05.970" end="02:42:10.920" style="s2">developing better economic extraction</p>
<p begin="02:42:07.800" end="02:42:11.970" style="s2">tools were using our power in ways that</p>
<p begin="02:42:10.920" end="02:42:13.979" style="s2">are coming</p>
<p begin="02:42:11.970" end="02:42:15.630" style="s2">destructive in a narrow sentence and</p>
<p begin="02:42:13.979" end="02:42:17.550" style="s2">destructive in a larger sense but</p>
<p begin="02:42:15.630" end="02:42:20.220" style="s2">everybody is doing that this doesn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="02:42:17.550" end="02:42:24.120" style="s2">it happen forever so this phase defined</p>
<p begin="02:42:20.220" end="02:42:26.069" style="s2">by increasing power on all sides used in</p>
<p begin="02:42:24.120" end="02:42:29.160" style="s2">destructive ways constructive narrowly</p>
<p begin="02:42:26.069" end="02:42:31.050" style="s2">but destructive broadly that phase comes</p>
<p begin="02:42:29.160" end="02:42:32.430" style="s2">to an end and there&#39;s something like a</p>
<p begin="02:42:31.050" end="02:42:34.290" style="s2">hard fork where if we keep doing</p>
<p begin="02:42:32.430" end="02:42:36.239" style="s2">anything similar to that it&#39;ll come to</p>
<p begin="02:42:34.290" end="02:42:38.250" style="s2">an end cumulatively whether existential</p>
<p begin="02:42:36.239" end="02:42:40.590" style="s2">or catastrophic more likely catastrophic</p>
<p begin="02:42:38.250" end="02:42:43.350" style="s2">right not full everything end but a lot</p>
<p begin="02:42:40.590" end="02:42:47.489" style="s2">and to be able to have that much power</p>
<p begin="02:42:43.350" end="02:42:50.340" style="s2">and not use it in ways that destroy the</p>
<p begin="02:42:47.489" end="02:42:52.920" style="s2">system requires being actually good</p>
<p begin="02:42:50.340" end="02:42:55.680" style="s2">stewards of power so then the whole</p>
<p begin="02:42:52.920" end="02:42:57.660" style="s2">question for me becomes how do we make a</p>
<p begin="02:42:55.680" end="02:42:59.550" style="s2">social system like what is the the</p>
<p begin="02:42:57.660" end="02:43:03.450" style="s2">Bodhisattva engineering how do we make a</p>
<p begin="02:42:59.550" end="02:43:04.920" style="s2">social system that is conditioning not</p>
<p begin="02:43:03.450" end="02:43:07.859" style="s2">just individual humans but also</p>
<p begin="02:43:04.920" end="02:43:10.859" style="s2">collectives to do good choice making</p>
<p begin="02:43:07.859" end="02:43:12.510" style="s2">Omni positive kind of choice making well</p>
<p begin="02:43:10.859" end="02:43:14.580" style="s2">I have to have a sense making system</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.510" end="02:43:16.800" style="s2">that can factor things like</p>
<p begin="02:43:14.580" end="02:43:18.960" style="s2">externalities ahead of time better and</p>
<p begin="02:43:16.800" end="02:43:20.609" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t have things like multipolar</p>
<p begin="02:43:18.960" end="02:43:22.260" style="s2">traps where if anybody is doing the</p>
<p begin="02:43:20.609" end="02:43:25.560" style="s2"> up thing that everybody has to do</p>
<p begin="02:43:22.260" end="02:43:27.540" style="s2">it and so I can start to think about</p>
<p begin="02:43:25.560" end="02:43:30.210" style="s2">what architectures such a system would</p>
<p begin="02:43:27.540" end="02:43:32.279" style="s2">have to have to be able to do sentence</p>
<p begin="02:43:30.210" end="02:43:34.670" style="s2">making as to what externalities would be</p>
<p begin="02:43:32.279" end="02:43:38.069" style="s2">and be able to internalize them and</p>
<p begin="02:43:34.670" end="02:43:39.689" style="s2">where then I can actually confer rights</p>
<p begin="02:43:38.069" end="02:43:43.260" style="s2">oice making and that we&#39;re developing</p>
<p begin="02:43:39.689" end="02:43:45.120" style="s2">humans so again think about the the</p>
<p begin="02:43:43.260" end="02:43:46.950" style="s2">education associated with some religions</p>
<p begin="02:43:45.120" end="02:43:48.779" style="s2">bringing about less violence the</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.950" end="02:43:51.300" style="s2">education associated with some cultures</p>
<p begin="02:43:48.779" end="02:43:53.220" style="s2">bringing about higher average cognitive</p>
<p begin="02:43:51.300" end="02:43:56.609" style="s2">capacity and being able to bring those</p>
<p begin="02:43:53.220" end="02:43:59.130" style="s2">together as much as I know this sounds</p>
<p begin="02:43:56.609" end="02:44:02.850" style="s2">like hippie and silly I don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="02:43:59.130" end="02:44:07.229" style="s2">see anything other than a radical</p>
<p begin="02:44:02.850" end="02:44:11.580" style="s2">increase in our good stewardship of</p>
<p begin="02:44:07.229" end="02:44:13.890" style="s2">power it makes it I love the idea that</p>
<p begin="02:44:11.580" end="02:44:16.739" style="s2">you think that there might be something</p>
<p begin="02:44:13.890" end="02:44:18.270" style="s2">here but let me come back it with my and</p>
<p begin="02:44:16.739" end="02:44:20.370" style="s2">again I&#39;m not trying to be negative I</p>
<p begin="02:44:18.270" end="02:44:23.359" style="s2">had it experienced at some point your</p>
<p begin="02:44:20.370" end="02:44:23.359" style="s2">answer requires a warp drive</p>
<p begin="02:44:23.970" end="02:44:28.739" style="s2">so we we both recognize the end-user</p>
<p begin="02:44:27.239" end="02:44:30.450" style="s2">ability of this thing and then are</p>
<p begin="02:44:28.739" end="02:44:33.090" style="s2">saying okay so what is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:44:30.450" end="02:44:34.649" style="s2">thing and something Lou I&#39;m not making</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.090" end="02:44:35.430" style="s2">fun of you because what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="02:44:34.649" end="02:44:38.040" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="02:44:35.430" end="02:44:40.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying is insane and the people</p>
<p begin="02:44:38.040" end="02:44:43.170" style="s2">who are saying the most common</p>
<p begin="02:44:40.710" end="02:44:47.430" style="s2">supposedly adult things are the craziest</p>
<p begin="02:44:43.170" end="02:44:49.380" style="s2">of us all so I at least accept the idea</p>
<p begin="02:44:47.430" end="02:44:52.380" style="s2">that we have to be here and I want you</p>
<p begin="02:44:49.380" end="02:44:54.510" style="s2">on that branch and I want other people</p>
<p begin="02:44:52.380" end="02:44:55.979" style="s2">on other branches because we need to fan</p>
<p begin="02:44:54.510" end="02:45:00.239" style="s2">out and start exploring at least start</p>
<p begin="02:44:55.979" end="02:45:01.739" style="s2">to care but I guess what I what what</p>
<p begin="02:45:00.239" end="02:45:06.239" style="s2">this makes me think of it was a</p>
<p begin="02:45:01.739" end="02:45:09.330" style="s2">particular moment in my life where one</p>
<p begin="02:45:06.239" end="02:45:12.870" style="s2">of my closest friends brought his father</p>
<p begin="02:45:09.330" end="02:45:18.979" style="s2">to dinner and his father was a guy who</p>
<p begin="02:45:12.870" end="02:45:21.410" style="s2">was legendary in the film industry and</p>
<p begin="02:45:18.979" end="02:45:23.970" style="s2">one of the things he taught his son was</p>
<p begin="02:45:21.410" end="02:45:28.200" style="s2">never let the other guy get the first</p>
<p begin="02:45:23.970" end="02:45:33.920" style="s2">punch in and I thought wow first strike</p>
<p begin="02:45:28.200" end="02:45:33.920" style="s2">you teaching your child to strike first</p>
<p begin="02:45:34.310" end="02:45:38.580" style="s2">nobody had ever suggested anything</p>
<p begin="02:45:36.630" end="02:45:40.319" style="s2">remotely like that in all of my</p>
<p begin="02:45:38.580" end="02:45:43.739" style="s2">upbringing I never heard anything like</p>
<p begin="02:45:40.319" end="02:45:45.180" style="s2">this and I instantly recognized it for</p>
<p begin="02:45:43.739" end="02:45:49.310" style="s2">what it was somebody was going to</p>
<p begin="02:45:45.180" end="02:45:52.050" style="s2">parasitize whatever I had been taught</p>
<p begin="02:45:49.310" end="02:45:54.739" style="s2">and say well great Eric&#39;s been taught</p>
<p begin="02:45:52.050" end="02:45:56.340" style="s2">self-restraint Eric&#39;s been taught to</p>
<p begin="02:45:54.739" end="02:45:58.800" style="s2">turn the other cheek</p>
<p begin="02:45:56.340" end="02:46:01.830" style="s2">to make sure that you de-escalate a</p>
<p begin="02:45:58.800" end="02:46:04.670" style="s2">conflict and goodie-goodie</p>
<p begin="02:46:01.830" end="02:46:08.970" style="s2">more for me your multipolar trap right</p>
<p begin="02:46:04.670" end="02:46:14.189" style="s2">okay there&#39;s a way out of it tell me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:46:08.970" end="02:46:16.710" style="s2">dying to hear it so do we retrofit the</p>
<p begin="02:46:14.189" end="02:46:22.260" style="s2">system no impossible foundational axioms</p>
<p begin="02:46:16.710" end="02:46:24.420" style="s2">are all the wrong axioms can we can we</p>
<p begin="02:46:22.260" end="02:46:27.390" style="s2">make a situation in which we can raise</p>
<p begin="02:46:24.420" end="02:46:30.029" style="s2">children quite differently yes go to see</p>
<p begin="02:46:27.390" end="02:46:31.830" style="s2">kids who grew up in an Amazonian tribe</p>
<p begin="02:46:30.029" end="02:46:33.689" style="s2">or you know some very different</p>
<p begin="02:46:31.830" end="02:46:36.860" style="s2">conditioning environment you&#39;ll see very</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.689" end="02:46:39.811" style="s2">different types of human behavior</p>
<p begin="02:46:36.860" end="02:46:45.990" style="s2">can we change already set adults much</p>
<p begin="02:46:39.811" end="02:46:49.891" style="s2">harder not impossible but harder so can</p>
<p begin="02:46:45.990" end="02:46:51.450" style="s2">we could we find adults that are that</p>
<p begin="02:46:49.891" end="02:46:53.671" style="s2">would be the most likely to be fast</p>
<p begin="02:46:51.450" end="02:46:55.711" style="s2">adopters of a new system like this and</p>
<p begin="02:46:53.671" end="02:47:00.931" style="s2">capable so both kind of at the cutting</p>
<p begin="02:46:55.711" end="02:47:03.120" style="s2">edge of their capacity to have abstract</p>
<p begin="02:47:00.931" end="02:47:06.061" style="s2">wide empathy and bind that to their</p>
<p begin="02:47:03.120" end="02:47:08.011" style="s2">action and you know deeply considerate</p>
<p begin="02:47:06.061" end="02:47:10.051" style="s2">about actual cause-and-effect dynamics</p>
<p begin="02:47:08.011" end="02:47:12.721" style="s2">factor complexity and work with other</p>
<p begin="02:47:10.051" end="02:47:15.631" style="s2">people well can we find the ones that</p>
<p begin="02:47:12.721" end="02:47:17.820" style="s2">are closest there and then train them up</p>
<p begin="02:47:15.631" end="02:47:20.070" style="s2">additionally in some systems that are</p>
<p begin="02:47:17.820" end="02:47:22.110" style="s2">developed for how to do a different</p>
<p begin="02:47:20.070" end="02:47:24.841" style="s2">process of collaboration that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:47:22.110" end="02:47:27.421" style="s2">lead to one way of talking about it is</p>
<p begin="02:47:24.841" end="02:47:29.761" style="s2">that when we go to command and control</p>
<p begin="02:47:27.421" end="02:47:31.891" style="s2">hierarchy systems to get beyond the</p>
<p begin="02:47:29.761" end="02:47:34.530" style="s2">Dunbar number we get diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="02:47:31.891" end="02:47:35.881" style="s2">on collective intelligence as a number</p>
<p begin="02:47:34.530" end="02:47:38.160" style="s2">as a function of the number of people</p>
<p begin="02:47:35.881" end="02:47:39.870" style="s2">which creates an incentive to defect</p>
<p begin="02:47:38.160" end="02:47:41.490" style="s2">against that system even internal</p>
<p begin="02:47:39.870" end="02:47:43.200" style="s2">defection and so then we get a problem</p>
<p begin="02:47:41.490" end="02:47:45.961" style="s2">if we could get collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:47:43.200" end="02:47:49.051" style="s2">scaling linearly we get something</p>
<p begin="02:47:45.961" end="02:47:50.280" style="s2">radically different so we get just the</p>
<p begin="02:47:49.051" end="02:47:54.030" style="s2">number of people that are needed to be</p>
<p begin="02:47:50.280" end="02:47:54.751" style="s2">able to do something like that trained</p>
<p begin="02:47:54.030" end="02:47:57.751" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="02:47:54.751" end="02:47:59.251" style="s2">and we build a civilization a full-stack</p>
<p begin="02:47:57.751" end="02:48:01.530" style="s2">ground-up civilization because obviously</p>
<p begin="02:47:59.251" end="02:48:03.570" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about not private balance</p>
<p begin="02:48:01.530" end="02:48:05.311" style="s2">sheets and private property is the</p>
<p begin="02:48:03.570" end="02:48:07.230" style="s2">dominant system I&#39;m also going to talk</p>
<p begin="02:48:05.311" end="02:48:09.061" style="s2">about not democracy because the nature</p>
<p begin="02:48:07.230" end="02:48:11.311" style="s2">of voting is inherently polarizing to</p>
<p begin="02:48:09.061" end="02:48:14.011" style="s2">populations because we make propositions</p>
<p begin="02:48:11.311" end="02:48:15.690" style="s2">we&#39;re both voting for it and voting</p>
<p begin="02:48:14.011" end="02:48:16.711" style="s2">against it suck for somebody for</p>
<p begin="02:48:15.690" end="02:48:18.030" style="s2">something because they&#39;re based on</p>
<p begin="02:48:16.711" end="02:48:19.681" style="s2">theory of trade-offs where we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:48:18.030" end="02:48:21.030" style="s2">even tried to figure out what a good</p>
<p begin="02:48:19.681" end="02:48:24.150" style="s2">proposition for everybody would be in</p>
<p begin="02:48:21.030" end="02:48:27.271" style="s2">the first place so better systems of</p>
<p begin="02:48:24.150" end="02:48:30.421" style="s2">sense-making in choice making which we</p>
<p begin="02:48:27.271" end="02:48:32.400" style="s2">could get to and so let&#39;s say you have a</p>

<p begin="02:49:04.650" end="02:49:08.221" style="s2">then they&#39;re like well why the are</p>
<p begin="02:49:06.480" end="02:49:09.420" style="s2">you figuring out these pieces of tech</p>
<p begin="02:49:08.221" end="02:49:11.011" style="s2">and we aren&#39;t we&#39;re like well we figured</p>
<p begin="02:49:09.420" end="02:49:12.721" style="s2">out a better social system and if you</p>
<p begin="02:49:11.011" end="02:49:14.610" style="s2">want it you&#39;re welcome to use it we were</p>
<p begin="02:49:12.721" end="02:49:15.931" style="s2">open sourcing the technology here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="02:49:14.610" end="02:49:18.420" style="s2">here&#39;s how it works</p>
<p begin="02:49:15.931" end="02:49:21.271" style="s2">but given that the technology as a</p>
<p begin="02:49:18.420" end="02:49:22.980" style="s2">social technology is a social technology</p>
<p begin="02:49:21.271" end="02:49:24.690" style="s2">of how people share information and</p>
<p begin="02:49:22.980" end="02:49:26.521" style="s2">share resources and coordinate</p>
<p begin="02:49:24.690" end="02:49:29.160" style="s2">differently it can&#39;t be weaponized</p>
<p begin="02:49:26.521" end="02:49:32.341" style="s2">because it is kind of the solvent of</p>
<p begin="02:49:29.160" end="02:49:35.790" style="s2">weaponization itself and so any other</p>
<p begin="02:49:32.341" end="02:49:38.040" style="s2">group using it is just now that kind of</p>
<p begin="02:49:35.790" end="02:49:43.500" style="s2">social architecture starting to spore or</p>
<p begin="02:49:38.040" end="02:49:46.860" style="s2">to scale and so yeah I think you get out</p>
<p begin="02:49:43.500" end="02:49:49.261" style="s2">of the multipolar trap by you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="02:49:46.860" end="02:49:51.660" style="s2">to win at the game of power against some</p>
<p begin="02:49:49.261" end="02:49:56.670" style="s2">external force to avoid losing at the</p>
<p begin="02:49:51.660" end="02:49:58.440" style="s2">game of power so far if people didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:49:56.670" end="02:50:03.631" style="s2">focus on militarizing they lost to</p>
<p begin="02:49:58.440" end="02:50:04.950" style="s2">whoever militarized and if they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:50:03.631" end="02:50:06.120" style="s2">lose to whoever militarize is because</p>
<p begin="02:50:04.950" end="02:50:07.561" style="s2">they militarized which means their</p>
<p begin="02:50:06.120" end="02:50:10.650" style="s2">culture became a culture that supports</p>
<p begin="02:50:07.561" end="02:50:13.650" style="s2">the ideas of militarization right but if</p>
<p begin="02:50:10.650" end="02:50:15.420" style="s2">I focus on being able to have whoever</p>
<p begin="02:50:13.650" end="02:50:17.070" style="s2">would militarize against me be able to</p>
<p begin="02:50:15.420" end="02:50:19.170" style="s2">offer them things that are particularly</p>
<p begin="02:50:17.070" end="02:50:20.670" style="s2">valuable that are novel to a collective</p>
<p begin="02:50:19.170" end="02:50:23.070" style="s2">intelligence that can do better</p>
<p begin="02:50:20.670" end="02:50:26.870" style="s2">innovation yeah you get out of a</p>
<p begin="02:50:23.070" end="02:50:30.780" style="s2">multipolar trap that way I want to try</p>
<p begin="02:50:26.870" end="02:50:33.091" style="s2">aggregating all the little bits that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:50:30.780" end="02:50:36.360" style="s2">getting from you and seeing whether I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:50:33.091" end="02:50:38.900" style="s2">coming anywhere close okay all right so</p>
<p begin="02:50:36.360" end="02:50:41.221" style="s2">the way I&#39;m seeing it did is the father</p>
<p begin="02:50:38.900" end="02:50:43.290" style="s2">first of all you&#39;re gonna point out to</p>
<p begin="02:50:41.221" end="02:50:44.820" style="s2">me that there are all sorts of</p>
<p begin="02:50:43.290" end="02:50:47.790" style="s2">interesting things that have not been</p>
<p begin="02:50:44.820" end="02:50:49.710" style="s2">really effectively scaled up so your</p>
<p begin="02:50:47.790" end="02:50:51.511" style="s2">point about Buddhism and Jains and</p>
<p begin="02:50:49.710" end="02:50:54.841" style="s2">what-have-you</p>
<p begin="02:50:51.511" end="02:50:57.931" style="s2">it might be possible to use this</p>
<p begin="02:50:54.841" end="02:51:01.080" style="s2">enormous and luxurious developmental</p>
<p begin="02:50:57.931" end="02:51:03.660" style="s2">period for something radically different</p>
<p begin="02:51:01.080" end="02:51:04.020" style="s2">and that something you haven&#39;t said but</p>
<p begin="02:51:03.660" end="02:51:05.850" style="s2">I&#39;ll throw</p>
<p begin="02:51:04.020" end="02:51:11.670" style="s2">to mix and see whether you rejected is</p>
<p begin="02:51:05.850" end="02:51:15.619" style="s2">that man&#39;s capacity for self that is</p>
<p begin="02:51:11.670" end="02:51:18.449" style="s2">somatic eradication through fanaticism</p>
<p begin="02:51:15.619" end="02:51:21.029" style="s2">tells you how powerful the software can</p>
<p begin="02:51:18.449" end="02:51:25.020" style="s2">be that you can teach people to die for</p>
<p begin="02:51:21.029" end="02:51:28.439" style="s2">a cause let&#39;s say and which is obviously</p>
<p begin="02:51:25.020" end="02:51:31.319" style="s2">against genetic comparatives no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:51:28.439" end="02:51:35.100" style="s2">obviously against individual genetic</p>
<p begin="02:51:31.319" end="02:51:37.409" style="s2">imperative but the genetics doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="02:51:35.100" end="02:51:39.810" style="s2">at the level of the individual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:51:37.409" end="02:51:43.109" style="s2">obviously against the somatic the</p>
<p begin="02:51:39.810" end="02:51:45.149" style="s2">assumed somatic imperatives it could</p>
<p begin="02:51:43.109" end="02:51:46.770" style="s2">actually benefit inclusive fitness I</p>
<p begin="02:51:45.149" end="02:51:49.289" style="s2">think there&#39;s a very good reason to</p>
<p begin="02:51:46.770" end="02:51:53.310" style="s2">imagine that you actually benefit your</p>
<p begin="02:51:49.289" end="02:51:54.409" style="s2">clan if your deed is known so I know I</p>
<p begin="02:51:53.310" end="02:51:57.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get into that but</p>
<p begin="02:51:54.409" end="02:52:00.239" style="s2">fanaticism exists and maybe fungible I</p>
<p begin="02:51:57.960" end="02:52:04.890" style="s2">think the Tamils for example probably</p>
<p begin="02:52:00.239" end="02:52:06.510" style="s2">showed us that fanaticism can be used at</p>
<p begin="02:52:04.890" end="02:52:08.670" style="s2">a political level as long as you get</p>
<p begin="02:52:06.510" end="02:52:12.390" style="s2">access to children in Sri Lanka yeah</p>
<p begin="02:52:08.670" end="02:52:15.210" style="s2">okay so our sister children was a key</p>
<p begin="02:52:12.390" end="02:52:18.869" style="s2">thing I think so yeah right so the idea</p>
<p begin="02:52:15.210" end="02:52:21.060" style="s2">is that you in effect and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="02:52:18.869" end="02:52:23.850" style="s2">to put words in your mouth one of the</p>
<p begin="02:52:21.060" end="02:52:27.600" style="s2">lessons of human history is that the</p>
<p begin="02:52:23.850" end="02:52:30.930" style="s2">developed developmental process if not</p>
<p begin="02:52:27.600" end="02:52:33.359" style="s2">used for the traditional Darwinian</p>
<p begin="02:52:30.930" end="02:52:39.289" style="s2">imperative is available for other uses</p>
<p begin="02:52:33.359" end="02:52:41.970" style="s2">and it is of arbitrary power yeah now</p>
<p begin="02:52:39.289" end="02:52:43.739" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get into the ethics of it but</p>
<p begin="02:52:41.970" end="02:52:46.409" style="s2">first I just wanna get into feasibility</p>
<p begin="02:52:43.739" end="02:52:48.300" style="s2">so first of all there&#39;s an enormous I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:52:46.409" end="02:52:50.340" style="s2">gonna keep going back to square zero if</p>
<p begin="02:52:48.300" end="02:52:51.390" style="s2">I don&#39;t get this all right first thing</p>
<p begin="02:52:50.340" end="02:52:53.460" style="s2">is you&#39;re pointing it we&#39;re not on the</p>
<p begin="02:52:51.390" end="02:52:55.079" style="s2">efficient frontier we&#39;re screwing up</p>
<p begin="02:52:53.460" end="02:52:58.260" style="s2">everywhere we could be doing a lot</p>
<p begin="02:52:55.079" end="02:53:00.899" style="s2">better appreciate that next point is</p>
<p begin="02:52:58.260" end="02:53:03.210" style="s2">there are a ton of different things that</p>
<p begin="02:53:00.899" end="02:53:04.560" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really looked at pushing and</p>
<p begin="02:53:03.210" end="02:53:07.130" style="s2">we could afford to push on all of these</p>
<p begin="02:53:04.560" end="02:53:09.569" style="s2">things principle among those things is</p>
<p begin="02:53:07.130" end="02:53:10.890" style="s2">we should be using development for</p>
<p begin="02:53:09.569" end="02:53:13.560" style="s2">something radically different and</p>
<p begin="02:53:10.890" end="02:53:16.739" style="s2">studying cultures which have an</p>

<p begin="02:53:17.580" end="02:53:21.960" style="s2">to them to see what have we already been</p>
<p begin="02:53:20.460" end="02:53:25.050" style="s2">able to do and then we can engineer on</p>
<p begin="02:53:21.960" end="02:53:28.440" style="s2">top of that Adams is are different than</p>
<p begin="02:53:25.050" end="02:53:31.380" style="s2">bits Adams have a some somewhat finite</p>
<p begin="02:53:28.440" end="02:53:33.630" style="s2">feel to them bits feels effectively</p>
<p begin="02:53:31.380" end="02:53:35.760" style="s2">infinite so to the extent that we can</p>
<p begin="02:53:33.630" end="02:53:38.370" style="s2">move things from atoms to bits and not</p>
<p begin="02:53:35.760" end="02:53:39.780" style="s2">be coupled to a market system where you</p>
<p begin="02:53:38.370" end="02:53:42.080" style="s2">have this problem of the de bundles</p>

<p begin="02:53:42.080" end="02:53:47.311" style="s2">causes markets to fail but then</p>
<p begin="02:53:44.880" end="02:53:49.340" style="s2">something else succeeds in instead that</p>
<p begin="02:53:47.311" end="02:53:51.750" style="s2">we can start to have abundance</p>
<p begin="02:53:49.340" end="02:53:53.640" style="s2">particularly where we decouple and we</p>
<p begin="02:53:51.750" end="02:53:56.660" style="s2">learn more about recycling</p>
<p begin="02:53:53.640" end="02:53:59.400" style="s2">so that finite resources are much better</p>
<p begin="02:53:56.660" end="02:54:01.320" style="s2">appreciated for what they are that we</p>
<p begin="02:53:59.400" end="02:54:03.980" style="s2">can get to a point where we can start to</p>

<p begin="02:54:03.980" end="02:54:09.210" style="s2">particularly if somebody&#39;s producing</p>

<p begin="02:54:12.870" end="02:54:20.400" style="s2">films so I&#39;m not angry about that so now</p>
<p begin="02:54:17.700" end="02:54:22.080" style="s2">we&#39;re scaling up all of these things the</p>

<p begin="02:54:22.080" end="02:54:30.180" style="s2">this than the other thing I like it</p>

<p begin="02:54:32.311" end="02:54:38.811" style="s2">one you&#39;d have to grimace I mean I want</p>
<p begin="02:54:35.910" end="02:54:43.110" style="s2">to have not grimacing and smiling okay</p>
<p begin="02:54:38.811" end="02:54:46.080" style="s2">one is the the lot what is the minimal</p>

<p begin="02:54:46.080" end="02:54:49.590" style="s2">bring about some of these changes so</p>
<p begin="02:54:48.420" end="02:54:52.110" style="s2">this was something that I brought up in</p>
<p begin="02:54:49.590" end="02:54:55.350" style="s2">my discussion with Peter Thiel and his</p>
<p begin="02:54:52.110" end="02:54:57.570" style="s2">and my sort of somewhat mutual framework</p>

<p begin="02:54:59.311" end="02:55:05.640" style="s2">is take take a beautiful dream ask what</p>

<p begin="02:55:09.990" end="02:55:12.930" style="s2">yourself is it still beautiful so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:55:11.790" end="02:55:19.220" style="s2">one of the questions that I would ask</p>
<p begin="02:55:12.930" end="02:55:23.640" style="s2">you and then I get to the issue of</p>
<p begin="02:55:19.220" end="02:55:29.040" style="s2">certain things like lakefront property</p>
<p begin="02:55:23.640" end="02:55:30.810" style="s2">in the atomic world anyway are valuable</p>
<p begin="02:55:29.040" end="02:55:34.680" style="s2">and unique</p>
<p begin="02:55:30.810" end="02:55:36.899" style="s2">and it becomes problematic to imagine a</p>
<p begin="02:55:34.680" end="02:55:39.600" style="s2">world in which all of our previous</p>
<p begin="02:55:36.899" end="02:55:47.609" style="s2">experience was about competing for these</p>
<p begin="02:55:39.600" end="02:55:51.630" style="s2">things to imagine 100% adherence to this</p>
<p begin="02:55:47.609" end="02:55:54.390" style="s2">new way of thinking well let&#39;s go proto</p>
<p begin="02:55:51.630" end="02:55:56.880" style="s2">pian not utopian let&#39;s go that there are</p>
<p begin="02:55:54.390" end="02:55:57.270" style="s2">some 0u by proto P moving in the right</p>
<p begin="02:55:56.880" end="02:56:00.630" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="02:55:57.270" end="02:56:03.810" style="s2">alright let&#39;s say that there are some</p>
<p begin="02:56:00.630" end="02:56:05.880" style="s2">things that are harder to make</p>
<p begin="02:56:03.810" end="02:56:07.260" style="s2">adequately abundant than other things</p>
<p begin="02:56:05.880" end="02:56:09.149" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of low-hanging fruit</p>
<p begin="02:56:07.260" end="02:56:11.579" style="s2">that we can start moving and as we do it</p>
<p begin="02:56:09.149" end="02:56:14.040" style="s2">we will get there&#39;s good reason to think</p>
<p begin="02:56:11.579" end="02:56:18.540" style="s2">that there is a basis to do that in more</p>
<p begin="02:56:14.040" end="02:56:20.819" style="s2">areas so in a system where when</p>
<p begin="02:56:18.540" end="02:56:23.130" style="s2">something is more scarce it is worth</p>
<p begin="02:56:20.819" end="02:56:25.470" style="s2">more then if I&#39;m on the supply side of</p>
<p begin="02:56:23.130" end="02:56:28.710" style="s2">that I have an incentive to manufacture</p>
<p begin="02:56:25.470" end="02:56:30.270" style="s2">artificial scarcity and to definitely</p>
<p begin="02:56:28.710" end="02:56:32.460" style="s2">prevent abundance that would debase the</p>
<p begin="02:56:30.270" end="02:56:35.670" style="s2">value of the thing that I have in a</p>
<p begin="02:56:32.460" end="02:56:37.890" style="s2">world where we remove the Association of</p>
<p begin="02:56:35.670" end="02:56:40.350" style="s2">value and scarcity than where there are</p>
<p begin="02:56:37.890" end="02:56:42.060" style="s2">actual scarcities the goal is to</p>
<p begin="02:56:40.350" end="02:56:44.100" style="s2">engineer the scarcity out of the system</p>
<p begin="02:56:42.060" end="02:56:46.560" style="s2">mm-hm and so if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:56:44.100" end="02:56:48.090" style="s2">limited amount of Oceanfront then this</p>
<p begin="02:56:46.560" end="02:56:49.770" style="s2">is where we say well can we do</p>
<p begin="02:56:48.090" end="02:56:51.689" style="s2">seasteading and create a lot of</p>
<p begin="02:56:49.770" end="02:56:52.890" style="s2">Oceanfront that is really awesome where</p>
<p begin="02:56:51.689" end="02:56:54.420" style="s2">there is actually more to they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="02:56:52.890" end="02:56:55.890" style="s2">like more people are shopping at the</p>
<p begin="02:56:54.420" end="02:56:58.470" style="s2">store then we need more shopping carts</p>
<p begin="02:56:55.890" end="02:57:00.060" style="s2">and so part of the answer is how do we</p>
<p begin="02:56:58.470" end="02:57:01.770" style="s2">actually increase the abundance but not</p>
<p begin="02:57:00.060" end="02:57:02.909" style="s2">an exponential abundance because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:57:01.770" end="02:57:05.369" style="s2">talking about also steady-state</p>
<p begin="02:57:02.909" end="02:57:12.529" style="s2">population and using and a lot of shared</p>
<p begin="02:57:05.369" end="02:57:14.310" style="s2">resources and it&#39;s that coupled with</p>
<p begin="02:57:12.529" end="02:57:15.600" style="s2">psychologically healthy or more mature</p>
<p begin="02:57:14.310" end="02:57:17.369" style="s2">people that relate to these things</p>
<p begin="02:57:15.600" end="02:57:18.630" style="s2">differently both of those are necessary</p>
<p begin="02:57:17.369" end="02:57:20.310" style="s2">now there would be sufficient on their</p>
<p begin="02:57:18.630" end="02:57:23.790" style="s2">own well I like that a lot</p>
<p begin="02:57:20.310" end="02:57:27.899" style="s2">and I I do quite honestly take some hope</p>
<p begin="02:57:23.790" end="02:57:30.420" style="s2">in that I&#39;m finding that what people are</p>
<p begin="02:57:27.899" end="02:57:33.779" style="s2">now rival RIS about has changed a lot I</p>
<p begin="02:57:30.420" end="02:57:36.420" style="s2">think over the course of my life I think</p>
<p begin="02:57:33.779" end="02:57:38.550" style="s2">Millennials are much more interested in</p>
<p begin="02:57:36.420" end="02:57:40.319" style="s2">what what experiences have you had</p>
<p begin="02:57:38.550" end="02:57:44.010" style="s2">recently rather than what have you</p>
<p begin="02:57:40.319" end="02:57:44.479" style="s2">bought and purchased recently in part</p>
<p begin="02:57:44.010" end="02:57:46.430" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="02:57:44.479" end="02:57:49.310" style="s2">economy kind of turned against them but</p>
<p begin="02:57:46.430" end="02:57:52.369" style="s2">travel got cheap right and so that</p>
<p begin="02:57:49.310" end="02:57:56.869" style="s2">that&#39;s been interesting to see do you</p>
<p begin="02:57:52.369" end="02:58:00.260" style="s2">believe that we have a huge nearly</p>
<p begin="02:57:56.869" end="02:58:03.619" style="s2">universal level up in maturity and</p>
<p begin="02:58:00.260" end="02:58:09.850" style="s2">wisdom available to us through</p>
<p begin="02:58:03.619" end="02:58:14.420" style="s2">development hacking yeah and so it is</p>
<p begin="02:58:09.850" end="02:58:16.039" style="s2">both how we develop that socially which</p>
<p begin="02:58:14.420" end="02:58:18.949" style="s2">I don&#39;t think will happen uniformly I</p>
<p begin="02:58:16.039" end="02:58:21.949" style="s2">think will happen in pockets that become</p>
<p begin="02:58:18.949" end="02:58:24.439" style="s2">strange attractors that other groups</p>
<p begin="02:58:21.949" end="02:58:26.539" style="s2">want to then implement once seen because</p>
<p begin="02:58:24.439" end="02:58:31.100" style="s2">they&#39;re so clearly better at both</p>
<p begin="02:58:26.539" end="02:58:33.800" style="s2">quality of life and innovation and how</p>
<p begin="02:58:31.100" end="02:58:35.749" style="s2">long that takes to develop widely is a</p>
<p begin="02:58:33.800" end="02:58:40.460" style="s2">while like this is a multi generation</p>
<p begin="02:58:35.749" end="02:58:42.229" style="s2">thing okay I think that that would not</p>
<p begin="02:58:40.460" end="02:58:46.279" style="s2">be sufficient on its own but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:58:42.229" end="02:58:48.770" style="s2">necessary better sense making systems</p>
<p begin="02:58:46.279" end="02:58:50.479" style="s2">where we can actually solve problems</p>
<p begin="02:58:48.770" end="02:58:52.819" style="s2">without causing worse problems which</p>
<p begin="02:58:50.479" end="02:58:56.020" style="s2">we&#39;re not historically good at is also</p>
<p begin="02:58:52.819" end="02:58:58.489" style="s2">necessary and this is both some</p>
<p begin="02:58:56.020" end="02:59:00.409" style="s2">evolution in our epistemic sand our</p>
<p begin="02:58:58.489" end="02:59:06.470" style="s2">actual processes of collective sense</p>
<p begin="02:59:00.409" end="02:59:08.420" style="s2">making and collective coordination so</p>
<p begin="02:59:06.470" end="02:59:10.220" style="s2">yes I see level ups in both of those</p>
<p begin="02:59:08.420" end="02:59:13.909" style="s2">possible right now I&#39;m gonna ask a very</p>
<p begin="02:59:10.220" end="02:59:15.100" style="s2">difficult question but we have to get to</p>
<p begin="02:59:13.909" end="02:59:20.029" style="s2">it yeah</p>
<p begin="02:59:15.100" end="02:59:21.800" style="s2">in essence I&#39;ve got a riff which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:59:20.029" end="02:59:25.069" style="s2">think I&#39;ve said publicly which is that</p>
<p begin="02:59:21.800" end="02:59:28.670" style="s2">the the biggest problem with discussing</p>
<p begin="02:59:25.069" end="02:59:31.970" style="s2">sexuality is is that sexual sex is sexy</p>
<p begin="02:59:28.670" end="02:59:33.739" style="s2">and if you have something that&#39;s central</p>
<p begin="02:59:31.970" end="02:59:38.899" style="s2">to the world that is almost impossible</p>
<p begin="02:59:33.739" end="02:59:41.630" style="s2">to talk about yeah it&#39;s a very strange</p>
<p begin="02:59:38.899" end="02:59:44.239" style="s2">state of affairs assume that we solve</p>
<p begin="02:59:41.630" end="02:59:47.529" style="s2">all of these problems that don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="02:59:44.239" end="02:59:50.119" style="s2">do with status sex and reproduction</p>
<p begin="02:59:47.529" end="02:59:52.340" style="s2">according to your most optimistic</p>
<p begin="02:59:50.119" end="02:59:54.289" style="s2">scenario but we have trouble over here</p>
<p begin="02:59:52.340" end="02:59:58.650" style="s2">that there&#39;s one last little pesky</p>
<p begin="02:59:54.289" end="03:00:02.320" style="s2">problem yeah does this situation work</p>
<p begin="02:59:58.650" end="03:00:04.150" style="s2">yes now I will speak to it because as</p>
<p begin="03:00:02.320" end="03:00:08.710" style="s2">you said it is central and you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="03:00:04.150" end="03:00:10.601" style="s2">because it is central of course okay but</p>
<p begin="03:00:08.710" end="03:00:13.660" style="s2">my speaking to it is probably going to</p>
<p begin="03:00:10.601" end="03:00:16.540" style="s2">change the comment section of this video</p>
<p begin="03:00:13.660" end="03:00:19.240" style="s2">but so be it you know what if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:00:16.540" end="03:00:21.130" style="s2">want to come along for the ride they I I</p>
<p begin="03:00:19.240" end="03:00:25.780" style="s2">think that the most important thing is</p>
<p begin="03:00:21.130" end="03:00:27.730" style="s2">to just try to do this mean to say this</p>
<p begin="03:00:25.780" end="03:00:29.891" style="s2">to be horrible but let&#39;s try to take</p>
<p begin="03:00:27.730" end="03:00:33.190" style="s2">some of the stupid fun out of discussing</p>
<p begin="03:00:29.891" end="03:00:38.080" style="s2">sexuality by talking about it for what</p>
<p begin="03:00:33.190" end="03:00:40.720" style="s2">it is and a central system that has to</p>
<p begin="03:00:38.080" end="03:00:45.730" style="s2">be discussed because it is the engine of</p>
<p begin="03:00:40.720" end="03:00:49.150" style="s2">human behavior so your brother and I had</p>
<p begin="03:00:45.730" end="03:00:50.320" style="s2">this conversation when we met and</p>
<p begin="03:00:49.150" end="03:00:52.480" style="s2">obviously with his background</p>
<p begin="03:00:50.320" end="03:00:56.440" style="s2">evolutionary biology and Prime a mating</p>
<p begin="03:00:52.480" end="03:00:58.601" style="s2">and whatever I was very interested in</p>
<p begin="03:00:56.440" end="03:01:01.150" style="s2">his perspective and it took a little</p>
<p begin="03:00:58.601" end="03:01:03.700" style="s2">while but for what it&#39;s worth and let me</p>
<p begin="03:01:01.150" end="03:01:06.130" style="s2">just jump in one second Brett were he</p>
<p begin="03:01:03.700" end="03:01:09.700" style="s2">here yeah would break the theory of</p>
<p begin="03:01:06.130" end="03:01:14.230" style="s2">selection into two pieces that would be</p>
<p begin="03:01:09.700" end="03:01:16.660" style="s2">the stuff that follows natural selection</p>
<p begin="03:01:14.230" end="03:01:18.130" style="s2">the way we expected from Darwin and then</p>
<p begin="03:01:16.660" end="03:01:20.590" style="s2">you would break it into a second piece</p>
<p begin="03:01:18.130" end="03:01:25.210" style="s2">which is the stuff that goes completely</p>
<p begin="03:01:20.590" end="03:01:29.530" style="s2">counterintuitive due to sexual selection</p>
<p begin="03:01:25.210" end="03:01:31.240" style="s2">right and that division is actually part</p>
<p begin="03:01:29.530" end="03:01:33.280" style="s2">of the standard evolutionary teep</p>
<p begin="03:01:31.240" end="03:01:35.490" style="s2">toolkit he does it a little bit better</p>
<p begin="03:01:33.280" end="03:01:37.630" style="s2">and a little bit differently but that</p>
<p begin="03:01:35.490" end="03:01:40.360" style="s2">division into natural and sexual</p>
<p begin="03:01:37.630" end="03:01:42.130" style="s2">selection is part of the the territory</p>
<p begin="03:01:40.360" end="03:01:44.710" style="s2">and it really matters for when we think</p>
<p begin="03:01:42.130" end="03:01:47.080" style="s2">about resource scarcity because the</p>
<p begin="03:01:44.710" end="03:01:48.730" style="s2">resources that people need to deal with</p>
<p begin="03:01:47.080" end="03:01:51.101" style="s2">the first part the survival part are not</p>
<p begin="03:01:48.730" end="03:01:52.780" style="s2">that much right actually but the</p>
<p begin="03:01:51.101" end="03:01:54.460" style="s2">resources that people need to deal with</p>
<p begin="03:01:52.780" end="03:01:57.220" style="s2">the mating part is more than the other</p>
<p begin="03:01:54.460" end="03:01:59.230" style="s2">guy historically which is why the guy</p>
<p begin="03:01:57.220" end="03:02:01.330" style="s2">with 150 foot yacht might feel bad when</p>
<p begin="03:01:59.230" end="03:02:04.570" style="s2">the 200-foot yacht well this is up and</p>
<p begin="03:02:01.330" end="03:02:06.160" style="s2">let&#39;s say this is closed if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="03:02:04.570" end="03:02:10.690" style="s2">an evolutionary theorist I&#39;m not but we</p>
<p begin="03:02:06.160" end="03:02:14.460" style="s2">do our best there is a version of</p>
<p begin="03:02:10.690" end="03:02:20.681" style="s2">evolutionary theory which states that</p>
<p begin="03:02:14.460" end="03:02:22.391" style="s2">there needs to be crisis there needs to</p>
<p begin="03:02:20.681" end="03:02:28.000" style="s2">be a function for showing that you are</p>
<p begin="03:02:22.391" end="03:02:31.290" style="s2">better in order to keep individuals max</p>
<p begin="03:02:28.000" end="03:02:33.580" style="s2">you know sort of on that razor&#39;s edge of</p>
<p begin="03:02:31.290" end="03:02:35.921" style="s2">performance and that mating</p>
<p begin="03:02:33.580" end="03:02:38.521" style="s2">opportunities means that there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="03:02:35.921" end="03:02:43.480" style="s2">a crisis there&#39;s never enough abundance</p>
<p begin="03:02:38.521" end="03:02:45.490" style="s2">because somebody with 13 homes is more</p>
<p begin="03:02:43.480" end="03:02:46.750" style="s2">desirable than somebody with 9 homes if</p>
<p begin="03:02:45.490" end="03:02:49.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just trying to figure out if</p>
<p begin="03:02:46.750" end="03:02:50.650" style="s2">there were a crisis I mean who would do</p>
<p begin="03:02:49.240" end="03:02:52.721" style="s2">better right</p>
<p begin="03:02:50.650" end="03:02:55.240" style="s2">so we have to overcome that because that</p>

<p begin="03:03:00.940" end="03:03:12.160" style="s2">said we have to address it so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="03:03:08.351" end="03:03:15.960" style="s2">you my take on this as I explored it my</p>
<p begin="03:03:12.160" end="03:03:19.570" style="s2">process with myself has been asking ok</p>
<p begin="03:03:15.960" end="03:03:21.160" style="s2">as soon as I saw that the dynamics of</p>
<p begin="03:03:19.570" end="03:03:24.341" style="s2">this world that seemed intuitive and</p>
<p begin="03:03:21.160" end="03:03:26.261" style="s2">natural to most of us as we kind of grew</p>

<p begin="03:03:26.261" end="03:03:31.631" style="s2">self terminating and I said any of the</p>
<p begin="03:03:28.750" end="03:03:34.540" style="s2">things that we think of as normal I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="03:03:31.631" end="03:03:36.610" style="s2">willing to question deeply and so how do</p>
<p begin="03:03:34.540" end="03:03:39.521" style="s2">I think could I imagine a high-tech</p>
<p begin="03:03:36.610" end="03:03:41.771" style="s2">civilization that doesn&#39;t implode could</p>
<p begin="03:03:39.521" end="03:03:44.141" style="s2">I imagine a kind of enlightened planet</p>
<p begin="03:03:41.771" end="03:03:46.240" style="s2">what would life be like there all the</p>
<p begin="03:03:44.141" end="03:03:48.250" style="s2">different things conflict emotion</p>
<p begin="03:03:46.240" end="03:03:53.230" style="s2">resources and sexualities obviously one</p>
<p begin="03:03:48.250" end="03:03:55.181" style="s2">of the big questions and I think I think</p>
<p begin="03:03:53.230" end="03:03:56.740" style="s2">the book sex it wrong sex at dawn</p>
<p begin="03:03:55.181" end="03:03:58.811" style="s2">obviously gets plenty of things wrong</p>
<p begin="03:03:56.740" end="03:04:01.210" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to make a strong antithesis</p>
<p begin="03:03:58.811" end="03:04:04.061" style="s2">to the standard evolutionary history of</p>
<p begin="03:04:01.210" end="03:04:05.980" style="s2">Homo sapiens thesis but I think there</p>
<p begin="03:04:04.061" end="03:04:07.660" style="s2">are some key parts to it when they look</p>
<p begin="03:04:05.980" end="03:04:10.450" style="s2">at the moss wah people or the Canela</p>
<p begin="03:04:07.660" end="03:04:12.450" style="s2">people or people that did not have that</p>
<p begin="03:04:10.450" end="03:04:15.761" style="s2">had a stable society that was not</p>
<p begin="03:04:12.450" end="03:04:18.070" style="s2">primarily pair-bonded but had multi-male</p>
<p begin="03:04:15.761" end="03:04:19.931" style="s2">multi-female dynamics it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="03:04:18.070" end="03:04:21.221" style="s2">that&#39;s how humans mostly were that</p>
<p begin="03:04:19.931" end="03:04:23.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s to say that it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="03:04:29.199" end="03:04:33.640" style="s2">have been just needs to establish proof</p>
<p begin="03:04:31.810" end="03:04:35.439" style="s2">of concept and then we can try to scale</p>
<p begin="03:04:33.640" end="03:04:37.390" style="s2">it up from yeah it&#39;s a positive deviant</p>
<p begin="03:04:35.439" end="03:04:39.760" style="s2">analysis for proof of concept to then</p>
<p begin="03:04:37.390" end="03:04:42.340" style="s2">say can we make that actual is that a</p>
<p begin="03:04:39.760" end="03:04:47.080" style="s2">viable model for a new center and is</p>
<p begin="03:04:42.340" end="03:04:48.279" style="s2">that a possible thing to make and the</p>
<p begin="03:04:47.080" end="03:04:50.979" style="s2">fact that it didn&#39;t make it through</p>
<p begin="03:04:48.279" end="03:04:52.630" style="s2">evolution so far like evolution has a</p>
<p begin="03:04:50.979" end="03:04:55.300" style="s2">blind quality to it right where it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="03:04:52.630" end="03:04:59.229" style="s2">make a a DAP tation that makes sense in</p>
<p begin="03:04:55.300" end="03:05:01.750" style="s2">the moment DISA determined by something</p>
<p begin="03:04:59.229" end="03:05:03.909" style="s2">like warfare that is actually not that</p>
<p begin="03:05:01.750" end="03:05:06.489" style="s2">good long term receivin self terminating</p>
<p begin="03:05:03.909" end="03:05:07.659" style="s2">long term so the argument if it would</p>
<p begin="03:05:06.489" end="03:05:10.600" style="s2">have been a good system it would have</p>
<p begin="03:05:07.659" end="03:05:12.340" style="s2">made it well the thing that has made it</p>
<p begin="03:05:10.600" end="03:05:14.050" style="s2">is continuing to up ratchet rival risk</p>
<p begin="03:05:12.340" end="03:05:16.029" style="s2">capacity oh and that itself is gonna</p>
<p begin="03:05:14.050" end="03:05:17.979" style="s2">self-terminate metaclass hacking that</p>
<p begin="03:05:16.029" end="03:05:20.229" style="s2">somehow we&#39;ve hacked ourselves new</p>
<p begin="03:05:17.979" end="03:05:22.720" style="s2">positions we can keep surviving yeah and</p>
<p begin="03:05:20.229" end="03:05:23.979" style="s2">so one one version says that we can</p>
<p begin="03:05:22.720" end="03:05:26.140" style="s2">never escape the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="03:05:23.979" end="03:05:28.569" style="s2">imperatives the other says we will all</p>
<p begin="03:05:26.140" end="03:05:30.729" style="s2">we have always escaped whatever our last</p>
<p begin="03:05:28.569" end="03:05:32.560" style="s2">problem was and so we should be expected</p>
<p begin="03:05:30.729" end="03:05:34.540" style="s2">that even if there&#39;s only the sliver of</p>
<p begin="03:05:32.560" end="03:05:36.880" style="s2">hope we should exploit it to the fullest</p>
<p begin="03:05:34.540" end="03:05:39.159" style="s2">yeah and so generally this situation</p>
<p begin="03:05:36.880" end="03:05:41.529" style="s2">happens that we have a near-term</p>
<p begin="03:05:39.159" end="03:05:42.970" style="s2">incentive to pursue some advantage but</p>
<p begin="03:05:41.529" end="03:05:44.890" style="s2">where the disadvantage of that thing</p>
<p begin="03:05:42.970" end="03:05:46.449" style="s2">might happen over a much longer term and</p>
<p begin="03:05:44.890" end="03:05:48.159" style="s2">that&#39;s like one of the fundamental</p>
<p begin="03:05:46.449" end="03:05:49.870" style="s2">problems right the externality might</p>
<p begin="03:05:48.159" end="03:05:51.550" style="s2">show up over hundreds or thousands of</p>
<p begin="03:05:49.870" end="03:05:54.220" style="s2">years but the benefit occurs over this</p>
<p begin="03:05:51.550" end="03:05:55.989" style="s2">year so I have to do it so we have to</p>
<p begin="03:05:54.220" end="03:05:57.729" style="s2">get over that actually if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:05:55.989" end="03:05:59.680" style="s2">affecting the world in such fundamental</p>
<p begin="03:05:57.729" end="03:06:00.939" style="s2">ways over the long term we have to</p>
<p begin="03:05:59.680" end="03:06:02.830" style="s2">actually be factoring that into our</p>
<p begin="03:06:00.939" end="03:06:05.260" style="s2">decision making now that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="03:06:02.830" end="03:06:07.989" style="s2">minimum requirements of a game be if</p>
<p begin="03:06:05.260" end="03:06:13.479" style="s2">it&#39;s going to exist which also means of</p>
<p begin="03:06:07.989" end="03:06:15.250" style="s2">a viable civilization at all so when it</p>
<p begin="03:06:13.479" end="03:06:17.949" style="s2">comes to status because I think status</p>
<p begin="03:06:15.250" end="03:06:19.779" style="s2">and sexuality go largely together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:06:17.949" end="03:06:24.729" style="s2">not exactly one for one but there</p>
<p begin="03:06:19.779" end="03:06:26.979" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong correlation I was</p>
<p begin="03:06:24.729" end="03:06:29.170" style="s2">listening to you on a few podcasts and</p>
<p begin="03:06:26.979" end="03:06:31.540" style="s2">you were talking about B Prime and</p>
<p begin="03:06:29.170" end="03:06:34.029" style="s2">talking about spinners and your kind of</p>
<p begin="03:06:31.540" end="03:06:36.100" style="s2">geometric unity and I was just</p>
<p begin="03:06:34.029" end="03:06:39.690" style="s2">loving it and I was loving even the</p>
<p begin="03:06:36.100" end="03:06:42.190" style="s2">status of like you described</p>
<p begin="03:06:39.690" end="03:06:43.780" style="s2">theoretical physics and mathematics well</p>
<p begin="03:06:42.190" end="03:06:45.101" style="s2">which are topics that you know so much</p>
<p begin="03:06:43.780" end="03:06:48.040" style="s2">better than I do but that I&#39;m fascinated</p>
<p begin="03:06:45.101" end="03:06:50.680" style="s2">by and educating the public about it and</p>
<p begin="03:06:48.040" end="03:06:52.570" style="s2">there was no like status competition</p>
<p begin="03:06:50.680" end="03:06:55.120" style="s2">impulse in me that was like oh boy wait</p>
<p begin="03:06:52.570" end="03:06:56.170" style="s2">he is being seen as smart for these</p>
<p begin="03:06:55.120" end="03:06:58.391" style="s2">things I was like wow this</p>
<p begin="03:06:56.170" end="03:07:00.730" style="s2">awesome I hope that he gets more status</p>
<p begin="03:06:58.391" end="03:07:03.790" style="s2">doing that because it&#39;s obviously good</p>
<p begin="03:07:00.730" end="03:07:07.660" style="s2">for the world jeez I have such different</p>
<p begin="03:07:03.790" end="03:07:09.280" style="s2">intuitions about this I mean you know to</p>
<p begin="03:07:07.660" end="03:07:12.430" style="s2">be blunt about it</p>
<p begin="03:07:09.280" end="03:07:16.630" style="s2">I didn&#39;t really talk about this stuff</p>
<p begin="03:07:12.430" end="03:07:20.440" style="s2">for ages and there was a part of me that</p>
<p begin="03:07:16.630" end="03:07:25.210" style="s2">cared about status but this was always a</p>
<p begin="03:07:20.440" end="03:07:26.830" style="s2">part in fact I really to the extent that</p>
<p begin="03:07:25.210" end="03:07:30.130" style="s2">I think that I have anything interesting</p>
<p begin="03:07:26.830" end="03:07:32.860" style="s2">and new it is a very uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="03:07:30.130" end="03:07:35.740" style="s2">feeling I mean I could show you all</p>
<p begin="03:07:32.860" end="03:07:38.250" style="s2">sorts of cool things on you know if I</p>
<p begin="03:07:35.740" end="03:07:42.370" style="s2">came up with a new lick on the guitar I</p>
<p begin="03:07:38.250" end="03:07:44.110" style="s2">would enjoy showing it to you this is</p>
<p begin="03:07:42.370" end="03:07:46.900" style="s2">something I feel very I have felt very</p>
<p begin="03:07:44.110" end="03:07:53.439" style="s2">uncomfortable about and there are ways</p>
<p begin="03:07:46.900" end="03:07:56.930" style="s2">in which well</p>
<p begin="03:07:53.439" end="03:07:58.850" style="s2">it&#39;s very apart for me from the status</p>
<p begin="03:07:56.930" end="03:08:01.160" style="s2">game I&#39;ve been fascinated looking at</p>
<p begin="03:07:58.850" end="03:08:02.930" style="s2">some of the comments where people say</p>
<p begin="03:08:01.160" end="03:08:05.029" style="s2">you know so-and-so is in it for the</p>
<p begin="03:08:02.930" end="03:08:08.180" style="s2">grift and they just want money and this</p>
<p begin="03:08:05.029" end="03:08:10.160" style="s2">is an ego trip and I have to say the</p>
<p begin="03:08:08.180" end="03:08:12.140" style="s2">least fun part the reason I didn&#39;t do a</p>
<p begin="03:08:10.160" end="03:08:16.970" style="s2">podcast for a long time and the reason</p>
<p begin="03:08:12.140" end="03:08:18.350" style="s2">that I I didn&#39;t commercialize this and</p>
<p begin="03:08:16.970" end="03:08:20.890" style="s2">I&#39;ve left a lot of money on the table</p>
<p begin="03:08:18.350" end="03:08:23.569" style="s2">and I&#39;m intending to commercialize this</p>
<p begin="03:08:20.890" end="03:08:25.220" style="s2">is that I was very uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="03:08:23.569" end="03:08:30.109" style="s2">all of these issues they didn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="03:08:25.220" end="03:08:33.979" style="s2">and I think people imagined that their</p>
<p begin="03:08:30.109" end="03:08:35.750" style="s2">first few increments of status are fun</p>
<p begin="03:08:33.979" end="03:08:38.120" style="s2">so that getting more and more status</p>
<p begin="03:08:35.750" end="03:08:39.920" style="s2">must be awesome and I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:08:38.120" end="03:08:42.290" style="s2">think that that&#39;s true I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="03:08:39.920" end="03:08:44.120" style="s2">little bit like wow my first my first</p>
<p begin="03:08:42.290" end="03:08:47.540" style="s2">taste of heroin was pretty sweet I</p>
<p begin="03:08:44.120" end="03:08:51.609" style="s2">should do this all the time it goes into</p>
<p begin="03:08:47.540" end="03:08:54.200" style="s2">some completely different place yeah so</p>
<p begin="03:08:51.609" end="03:08:56.330" style="s2">that is counter to the narrative that</p>
<p begin="03:08:54.200" end="03:08:58.460" style="s2">we&#39;re all seeking maximum status and in</p>
<p begin="03:08:56.330" end="03:09:00.220" style="s2">competition with each other for status</p>
<p begin="03:08:58.460" end="03:09:03.229" style="s2">well if you yeah I think that there is a</p>
<p begin="03:09:00.220" end="03:09:09.100" style="s2">that is a low-resolution narrative right</p>
<p begin="03:09:03.229" end="03:09:11.950" style="s2">I think that you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:09:09.100" end="03:09:15.080" style="s2">always make fun of the fact that</p>
<p begin="03:09:11.950" end="03:09:16.640" style="s2">evolutionarily you&#39;re crazy for sugar</p>
<p begin="03:09:15.080" end="03:09:20.720" style="s2">and the fact that they give it away for</p>
<p begin="03:09:16.640" end="03:09:23.000" style="s2">free at Starbucks you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="03:09:20.720" end="03:09:24.470" style="s2">part of you that&#39;s a three-year-old kid</p>
<p begin="03:09:23.000" end="03:09:26.300" style="s2">just wants to use many packets of sugar</p>
<p begin="03:09:24.470" end="03:09:28.220" style="s2">as you possibly can it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="03:09:26.300" end="03:09:30.260" style="s2">a good thing right yeah keep going I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="03:09:28.220" end="03:09:33.080" style="s2">sorry about that well so this is the</p>
<p begin="03:09:30.260" end="03:09:35.390" style="s2">thing I think I think it&#39;s actually true</p>
<p begin="03:09:33.080" end="03:09:37.220" style="s2">that there&#39;s a lot of status that is not</p>
<p begin="03:09:35.390" end="03:09:40.340" style="s2">really that fun this is also my</p>
<p begin="03:09:37.220" end="03:09:42.439" style="s2">experience but I think it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="03:09:40.340" end="03:09:44.779" style="s2">that we can feel good about rather than</p>
<p begin="03:09:42.439" end="03:09:48.950" style="s2">bad about where someone else is doing</p>
<p begin="03:09:44.779" end="03:09:50.689" style="s2">socially well well if we yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="03:09:48.950" end="03:09:54.680" style="s2">we if we have a kind of love and trust</p>
<p begin="03:09:50.689" end="03:09:56.810" style="s2">and we have an idea like you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="03:09:54.680" end="03:09:59.479" style="s2">friends with Andrew Yang and I disagree</p>
<p begin="03:09:56.810" end="03:10:00.920" style="s2">with a bunch of his policies but I have</p>
<p begin="03:09:59.479" end="03:10:04.310" style="s2">a feeling that he is a guy who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="03:10:00.920" end="03:10:06.271" style="s2">earnest you know I&#39;m knowing knowing him</p>
<p begin="03:10:04.310" end="03:10:10.080" style="s2">socially I have the sense that</p>
<p begin="03:10:06.271" end="03:10:11.551" style="s2">it is not an ego trip for him to want to</p>
<p begin="03:10:10.080" end="03:10:14.101" style="s2">steward the country it&#39;s a-you know</p>
<p begin="03:10:11.551" end="03:10:15.780" style="s2">you&#39;re taking on a position that puts</p>
<p begin="03:10:14.101" end="03:10:17.341" style="s2">you in a life-and-death situation with</p>
<p begin="03:10:15.780" end="03:10:20.990" style="s2">the number of attempts on presidents</p>
<p begin="03:10:17.341" end="03:10:24.200" style="s2">lives let&#39;s say it&#39;s a very solemn</p>
<p begin="03:10:20.990" end="03:10:28.141" style="s2">responsibility and I think that in part</p>
<p begin="03:10:24.200" end="03:10:30.480" style="s2">we want people who we feel are grounded</p>
<p begin="03:10:28.141" end="03:10:36.120" style="s2">and I by the way I&#39;m not always grounded</p>
<p begin="03:10:30.480" end="03:10:40.950" style="s2">you know so I&#39;ve drunk my own status you</p>
<p begin="03:10:36.120" end="03:10:43.110" style="s2">know to excess at times but it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="03:10:40.950" end="03:10:45.001" style="s2">tricky thing who do I want to have</p>
<p begin="03:10:43.110" end="03:10:48.150" style="s2">status who do I not want to ask that as</p>
<p begin="03:10:45.001" end="03:10:49.771" style="s2">do I trust I have a friend who is the</p>
<p begin="03:10:48.150" end="03:10:51.391" style="s2">nicest person in the world except when</p>
<p begin="03:10:49.771" end="03:10:53.551" style="s2">he&#39;s doing well and then he becomes very</p>
<p begin="03:10:51.391" end="03:10:56.280" style="s2">difficult to deal with you know so</p>
<p begin="03:10:53.551" end="03:10:59.490" style="s2">they&#39;re like that there&#39;s the person</p>
<p begin="03:10:56.280" end="03:11:02.030" style="s2">who&#39;s fine on one glass of alcohol and</p>
<p begin="03:10:59.490" end="03:11:06.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t want them to have three yeah</p>
<p begin="03:11:02.030" end="03:11:09.631" style="s2">so I think status as a hyper normal</p>
<p begin="03:11:06.660" end="03:11:11.221" style="s2">stimuli we&#39;re in a evolutionary</p>
<p begin="03:11:09.631" end="03:11:13.261" style="s2">environment we couldn&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="03:11:11.221" end="03:11:15.660" style="s2">more than 150 people pay attention to us</p>
<p begin="03:11:13.261" end="03:11:17.370" style="s2">yeah and now we can have a huge number</p>
<p begin="03:11:15.660" end="03:11:19.440" style="s2">of people pay attention to us and have</p>
<p begin="03:11:17.370" end="03:11:22.561" style="s2">it metro sized with likes or whatever I</p>
<p begin="03:11:19.440" end="03:11:25.410" style="s2">think it is like sugar a hyper normal</p>
<p begin="03:11:22.561" end="03:11:27.330" style="s2">stimulus that is very hard for it not to</p>
<p begin="03:11:25.410" end="03:11:28.891" style="s2">be bad for us and we actually have to</p>
<p begin="03:11:27.330" end="03:11:33.511" style="s2">have a very mature relationship to it</p>
<p begin="03:11:28.891" end="03:11:35.641" style="s2">and addiction of any kind any hyper</p>
<p begin="03:11:33.511" end="03:11:37.320" style="s2">normal stimulus that decreases normal</p>
<p begin="03:11:35.641" end="03:11:39.030" style="s2">stimulus is going to end up being net</p>
<p begin="03:11:37.320" end="03:11:41.370" style="s2">bad for us I think one of the metrics</p>
<p begin="03:11:39.030" end="03:11:43.971" style="s2">for how healthy a society is is inverse</p>
<p begin="03:11:41.370" end="03:11:46.771" style="s2">relationship to addictive dynamics</p>
<p begin="03:11:43.971" end="03:11:49.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the healthy environment</p>
<p begin="03:11:46.771" end="03:11:53.221" style="s2">conditions people that are not prone to</p>
<p begin="03:11:49.320" end="03:11:55.410" style="s2">addiction which means have actual more</p>
<p begin="03:11:53.221" end="03:11:57.301" style="s2">authenticity of choice because addiction</p>
<p begin="03:11:55.410" end="03:12:00.690" style="s2">compulsion writ large is less</p>
<p begin="03:11:57.301" end="03:12:03.240" style="s2">authenticity of choice and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:12:00.690" end="03:12:05.820" style="s2">interesting is the hyper normal stimulus</p>
<p begin="03:12:03.240" end="03:12:08.540" style="s2">what porn is to sex with sugar and salt</p>
<p begin="03:12:05.820" end="03:12:11.101" style="s2">and fat concentrated in a Frappuccino or</p>
<p begin="03:12:08.540" end="03:12:12.811" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s is to food right devoid of</p>

<p begin="03:12:14.940" end="03:12:20.430" style="s2">that betray the Ultimates the the</p>
<p begin="03:12:17.940" end="03:12:22.680" style="s2">originally the proximate stimulus</p>
<p begin="03:12:20.430" end="03:12:25.050" style="s2">is tied to the ultimate and ice the the</p>
<p begin="03:12:22.680" end="03:12:26.910" style="s2">brain keeps track of the proximate and</p>
<p begin="03:12:25.050" end="03:12:30.500" style="s2">then you can disconnect some of these</p>
<p begin="03:12:26.910" end="03:12:33.630" style="s2">like birth control disconnected</p>
<p begin="03:12:30.500" end="03:12:35.910" style="s2">sexuality from procreation right and in</p>
<p begin="03:12:33.630" end="03:12:38.340" style="s2">the same way if there was a healthy</p>
<p begin="03:12:35.910" end="03:12:40.080" style="s2">status relationship of in a tribal</p>
<p begin="03:12:38.340" end="03:12:41.580" style="s2">environment where I can&#39;t really lie and</p>
<p begin="03:12:40.080" end="03:12:43.050" style="s2">people really are watching me and know</p>
<p begin="03:12:41.580" end="03:12:44.939" style="s2">me if I&#39;m thought well of it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="03:12:43.050" end="03:12:46.800" style="s2">I&#39;m actually doing well by everybody and</p>
<p begin="03:12:44.939" end="03:12:49.800" style="s2">I have authentic healthy relationships</p>
<p begin="03:12:46.800" end="03:12:54.239" style="s2">as opposed to I can signal things that</p>
<p begin="03:12:49.800" end="03:12:58.170" style="s2">aren&#39;t true hmm and not and they and</p>
<p begin="03:12:54.239" end="03:13:00.330" style="s2">even get more status through negative</p>
<p begin="03:12:58.170" end="03:13:03.270" style="s2">signaling about other people and things</p>
<p begin="03:13:00.330" end="03:13:05.880" style="s2">like that and get a lot of hits from it</p>
<p begin="03:13:03.270" end="03:13:09.290" style="s2">it&#39;s that is the same kind of thing as</p>
<p begin="03:13:05.880" end="03:13:12.149" style="s2">the fast food or the corn is and so I</p>
<p begin="03:13:09.290" end="03:13:17.520" style="s2">think we have a hypo normal environment</p>
<p begin="03:13:12.149" end="03:13:22.109" style="s2">of the healthy stimulus that actually</p>
<p begin="03:13:17.520" end="03:13:25.439" style="s2">creates a baseline well-being so most</p>
<p begin="03:13:22.109" end="03:13:27.300" style="s2">people I find that when they go camping</p>
<p begin="03:13:25.439" end="03:13:28.680" style="s2">with their friends and they&#39;re in nature</p>
<p begin="03:13:27.300" end="03:13:30.270" style="s2">and they&#39;re actually in real authentic</p>

<p begin="03:13:35.160" end="03:13:40.859" style="s2">looking opening the fridge just blindly</p>
<p begin="03:13:38.460" end="03:13:43.350" style="s2">looking less often because they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="03:13:43.350" end="03:13:49.080" style="s2">engaging interaction but in a world</p>
<p begin="03:13:46.830" end="03:13:53.310" style="s2">where I have a lot of isolation nuclear</p>
<p begin="03:13:49.080" end="03:13:54.960" style="s2">family home structures etc and not</p>

<p begin="03:13:59.340" end="03:14:04.590" style="s2">increased susceptibility to hyper normal</p>
<p begin="03:14:01.710" end="03:14:08.760" style="s2">stimuli hyper normal stimuli happened to</p>
<p begin="03:14:04.590" end="03:14:10.050" style="s2">be good for markets because on the</p>
<p begin="03:14:08.760" end="03:14:12.270" style="s2">supply side if I want to maximize</p>

<p begin="03:14:18.120" end="03:14:25.640" style="s2">whole this I really like so if I</p>
<p begin="03:14:22.890" end="03:14:25.640" style="s2">understand you correctly</p>
<p begin="03:14:28.630" end="03:14:37.060" style="s2">people don&#39;t I mean this actually starts</p>
<p begin="03:14:33.640" end="03:14:39.700" style="s2">to solve a puzzle I think I heard that</p>
<p begin="03:14:37.060" end="03:14:43.090" style="s2">somebody asked Matt Damon whether he</p>
<p begin="03:14:39.700" end="03:14:45.460" style="s2">enjoyed being famous and he said it was</p>
<p begin="03:14:43.090" end="03:14:47.850" style="s2">if I have the story right and maybe</p>
<p begin="03:14:45.460" end="03:14:51.040" style="s2">somebody else I forgive me if I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="03:14:47.850" end="03:14:55.390" style="s2">he said it wasn&#39;t even fun for 15</p>
<p begin="03:14:51.040" end="03:14:57.670" style="s2">minutes and this is the hardest thing to</p>
<p begin="03:14:55.390" end="03:15:02.560" style="s2">convey is that if you&#39;ve never had any</p>
<p begin="03:14:57.670" end="03:15:04.510" style="s2">kind of status at all right that you</p>
<p begin="03:15:02.560" end="03:15:06.100" style="s2">know I I think I said to Tim Ferriss</p>
<p begin="03:15:04.510" end="03:15:09.580" style="s2">that you only wanted to be famous to</p>
<p begin="03:15:06.100" end="03:15:12.850" style="s2">3,000 hand-chosen people want your calls</p>
<p begin="03:15:09.580" end="03:15:14.530" style="s2">returned you know you you want to be</p>

<p begin="03:15:14.530" end="03:15:21.640" style="s2">to say you do not want to be universally</p>
<p begin="03:15:19.180" end="03:15:25.720" style="s2">known and that was the hardest decision</p>
<p begin="03:15:21.640" end="03:15:28.390" style="s2">and starting this podcast was I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:15:25.720" end="03:15:30.790" style="s2">think I had another option I mean part</p>
<p begin="03:15:28.390" end="03:15:35.260" style="s2">of the point of it is to get out ideas</p>
<p begin="03:15:30.790" end="03:15:36.550" style="s2">that I worry are not institutional you</p>
<p begin="03:15:35.260" end="03:15:39.760" style="s2">know there&#39;s no institution that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="03:15:39.760" end="03:15:46.300" style="s2">figure out met Redford for months is</p>
<p begin="03:15:43.420" end="03:15:49.060" style="s2">there a way to do this without becoming</p>
<p begin="03:15:46.300" end="03:15:51.580" style="s2">part of the story right and because I</p>
<p begin="03:15:49.060" end="03:15:54.430" style="s2">think that privacy and an individual</p>
<p begin="03:15:51.580" end="03:15:55.899" style="s2">life is so much more important and I</p>
<p begin="03:15:54.430" end="03:15:58.390" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that every time you bring</p>
<p begin="03:15:55.899" end="03:16:01.899" style="s2">something up you know it means that you</p>
<p begin="03:15:58.390" end="03:16:03.490" style="s2">should have your life ripped open and be</p>

<p begin="03:16:03.490" end="03:16:07.540" style="s2">unnatural I think what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="03:16:04.899" end="03:16:09.880" style="s2">tell me is that people think that they</p>
<p begin="03:16:07.540" end="03:16:12.160" style="s2">want to be fabulously rich they think</p>
<p begin="03:16:09.880" end="03:16:15.280" style="s2">they want to be famous they think they</p>
<p begin="03:16:12.160" end="03:16:18.070" style="s2">want unlimited sexual access and in fact</p>
<p begin="03:16:15.280" end="03:16:20.229" style="s2">it is the first few tastes of these</p>
<p begin="03:16:18.070" end="03:16:22.210" style="s2">things that convince them that there</p>
<p begin="03:16:20.229" end="03:16:24.310" style="s2">must be no limit to how wonderful the</p>

<p begin="03:16:24.310" end="03:16:29.170" style="s2">and in fact there is something I mean</p>
<p begin="03:16:27.310" end="03:16:32.110" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of you know like rosebud at</p>
<p begin="03:16:29.170" end="03:16:36.120" style="s2">the end of such a yeah those are much</p>
<p begin="03:16:32.110" end="03:16:38.139" style="s2">more like addiction and fulfillment and</p>

<p begin="03:16:38.139" end="03:16:42.369" style="s2">we&#39;ll give me a spike and then a crash</p>
<p begin="03:16:40.509" end="03:16:43.810" style="s2">and then because of the crash I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="03:16:42.369" end="03:16:45.609" style="s2">craving something that will spike me</p>
<p begin="03:16:43.810" end="03:16:47.289" style="s2">because I feel really shitty and but</p>
<p begin="03:16:45.609" end="03:16:50.709" style="s2">then I get an erosion of baseline over</p>
<p begin="03:16:47.289" end="03:16:52.299" style="s2">time from the effects of that and so of</p>
<p begin="03:16:50.709" end="03:16:53.949" style="s2">course the chocolate cake is gonna make</p>
<p begin="03:16:52.299" end="03:16:55.749" style="s2">me feel good in the moment but as I have</p>
<p begin="03:16:53.949" end="03:16:58.629" style="s2">a mostly chocolate cake died at my life</p>
<p begin="03:16:55.749" end="03:17:00.279" style="s2">feels shitty er as I average right as I</p>
<p begin="03:16:58.629" end="03:17:02.259" style="s2">do the integral under the curve it gets</p>
<p begin="03:17:00.279" end="03:17:03.939" style="s2">worse whereas the salad doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="03:17:02.259" end="03:17:05.679" style="s2">give me that spike but as I get</p>
<p begin="03:17:03.939" end="03:17:07.359" style="s2">healthier my baseline of pleasure</p>
<p begin="03:17:05.679" end="03:17:09.759" style="s2">throughout not just when I&#39;m eating but</p>
<p begin="03:17:07.359" end="03:17:11.319" style="s2">all of the time goes up because I have</p>
<p begin="03:17:09.759" end="03:17:13.029" style="s2">the capacity to engage in more</p>
<p begin="03:17:11.319" end="03:17:14.709" style="s2">interesting meaningful things and my</p>
<p begin="03:17:13.029" end="03:17:16.869" style="s2">body doesn&#39;t hurt as much in whatever so</p>
<p begin="03:17:14.709" end="03:17:18.489" style="s2">I think the interesting thing is that it</p>
<p begin="03:17:16.869" end="03:17:21.399" style="s2">is actually just like a healthier</p>
<p begin="03:17:18.489" end="03:17:23.169" style="s2">relationship to or a more effective</p>
<p begin="03:17:21.399" end="03:17:25.989" style="s2">relationship to pleasure is anti</p>
<p begin="03:17:23.169" end="03:17:27.399" style="s2">addictive but I think most of these</p>
<p begin="03:17:25.989" end="03:17:29.020" style="s2">things that people think they want are</p>
<p begin="03:17:27.399" end="03:17:31.029" style="s2">hyper normal stimuli that is the</p>
<p begin="03:17:29.020" end="03:17:34.239" style="s2">dopaminergic part separated from the</p>
<p begin="03:17:31.029" end="03:17:37.659" style="s2">substance I don&#39;t know how much I</p>
<p begin="03:17:34.239" end="03:17:39.849" style="s2">believe this but I like it a lot so if I</p>
<p begin="03:17:37.659" end="03:17:44.349" style="s2">understand you correctly there is a</p>
<p begin="03:17:39.849" end="03:17:45.429" style="s2">world of pleasure I don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="03:17:44.349" end="03:17:46.989" style="s2">call it pleasure I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="03:17:45.429" end="03:17:50.709" style="s2">to call it maybe it&#39;s much more on</p>
<p begin="03:17:46.989" end="03:17:52.810" style="s2">fulfillment that we would give up that</p>
<p begin="03:17:50.709" end="03:17:55.569" style="s2">no let me say it differently what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:17:52.810" end="03:17:58.389" style="s2">really saying is we are blind to the</p>
<p begin="03:17:55.569" end="03:18:01.599" style="s2">effect that somatic pleasure and Status</p>
<p begin="03:17:58.389" end="03:18:04.270" style="s2">pleasure is crowding out fulfilment in</p>
<p begin="03:18:01.599" end="03:18:07.299" style="s2">our lives and that were we to actually</p>
<p begin="03:18:04.270" end="03:18:10.469" style="s2">understand the cost of pleasure of</p>
<p begin="03:18:07.299" end="03:18:15.969" style="s2">rivalry that there is an individual</p>
<p begin="03:18:10.469" end="03:18:19.359" style="s2">reason to abandon somatic pleasure as</p>
<p begin="03:18:15.969" end="03:18:23.889" style="s2">the be-all and end-all how we how we</p>
<p begin="03:18:19.359" end="03:18:25.989" style="s2">create a life I mean this is how many</p>
<p begin="03:18:23.889" end="03:18:27.699" style="s2">how many awesome trips to Vegas did I</p>
<p begin="03:18:25.989" end="03:18:29.379" style="s2">did I have is that the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:18:27.699" end="03:18:32.489" style="s2">going to matter most to me on my</p>
<p begin="03:18:29.379" end="03:18:38.229" style="s2">deathbed yeah I don&#39;t think it ever has</p>
<p begin="03:18:32.489" end="03:18:40.989" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever what people</p>
<p begin="03:18:38.229" end="03:18:42.159" style="s2">would be most hopeful that there let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:18:40.989" end="03:18:44.499" style="s2">give it a name because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="03:18:42.159" end="03:18:47.289" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever been down this particular</p>
<p begin="03:18:44.499" end="03:18:48.789" style="s2">route let&#39;s call it deathbed mindset for</p>
<p begin="03:18:47.289" end="03:18:50.379" style="s2">the moment just to play with it see if</p>
<p begin="03:18:48.789" end="03:18:51.040" style="s2">it works and if it doesn&#39;t work we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="03:18:50.379" end="03:18:53.771" style="s2">trash it</p>
<p begin="03:18:51.040" end="03:18:57.250" style="s2">so people on their deathbed become</p>
<p begin="03:18:53.771" end="03:18:59.860" style="s2">focused on did I do enough for my</p>
<p begin="03:18:57.250" end="03:19:01.960" style="s2">community do my children think well of</p>
<p begin="03:18:59.860" end="03:19:04.180" style="s2">me I think what happens is people</p>
<p begin="03:19:01.960" end="03:19:07.990" style="s2">realize that everything they got dies</p>
<p begin="03:19:04.180" end="03:19:10.300" style="s2">with them like all in the end its</p>
<p begin="03:19:07.990" end="03:19:12.010" style="s2">lineage only and the way I touch the</p>
<p begin="03:19:10.300" end="03:19:15.370" style="s2">world continues and there&#39;s not just my</p>
<p begin="03:19:12.010" end="03:19:19.210" style="s2">biologic kids lid each of my thoughts</p>
<p begin="03:19:15.370" end="03:19:22.420" style="s2">yeah like memes along with genes and so</p>
<p begin="03:19:19.210" end="03:19:27.130" style="s2">I think when we really start to think</p>
<p begin="03:19:22.420" end="03:19:30.220" style="s2">about this clearly we recognize that</p>
<p begin="03:19:27.130" end="03:19:33.130" style="s2">this direction is self terminating the</p>
<p begin="03:19:30.220" end="03:19:35.440" style="s2">need to get stuff from the world that</p>
<p begin="03:19:33.130" end="03:19:37.150" style="s2">when I die it ends with me that there is</p>
<p begin="03:19:35.440" end="03:19:38.830" style="s2">actually only a kind of self</p>
<p begin="03:19:37.150" end="03:19:40.870" style="s2">transcendence and permanence in the way</p>
<p begin="03:19:38.830" end="03:19:43.240" style="s2">that I touch the world which does ripple</p>
<p begin="03:19:40.870" end="03:19:50.920" style="s2">ongoingly but there&#39;s also this thing</p>
<p begin="03:19:43.240" end="03:19:53.021" style="s2">where yeah again it I feel almost a</p>
<p begin="03:19:50.920" end="03:19:55.600" style="s2">little bit shy talking about it even</p>
<p begin="03:19:53.021" end="03:20:00.250" style="s2">even more than the sex topic in some</p>
<p begin="03:19:55.600" end="03:20:02.440" style="s2">ways because I&#39;m proposing that there is</p>
<p begin="03:20:00.250" end="03:20:04.990" style="s2">something like spiritual growth I think</p>
<p begin="03:20:02.440" end="03:20:05.620" style="s2">it&#39;s actually necessary for civilization</p>
<p begin="03:20:04.990" end="03:20:12.070" style="s2">to make it</p>
<p begin="03:20:05.620" end="03:20:15.430" style="s2">and so people affirming that they are</p>
<p begin="03:20:12.070" end="03:20:17.980" style="s2">these kind to themselves needy things</p>
<p begin="03:20:15.430" end="03:20:19.630" style="s2">that need stuff from the world yeah that</p>
<p begin="03:20:17.980" end="03:20:22.240" style="s2">need other people&#39;s validation and</p>
<p begin="03:20:19.630" end="03:20:23.620" style="s2">attention and etc and living life that</p>
<p begin="03:20:22.240" end="03:20:25.600" style="s2">way were the more of it they get what</p>
<p begin="03:20:23.620" end="03:20:27.720" style="s2">they&#39;re still getting as a self the</p>
<p begin="03:20:25.600" end="03:20:29.920" style="s2">affirmation of that sense of self as</p>
<p begin="03:20:27.720" end="03:20:35.021" style="s2">opposed to coming from a place of</p>
<p begin="03:20:29.920" end="03:20:37.210" style="s2">wholeness and the desire and actual love</p>
<p begin="03:20:35.021" end="03:20:39.880" style="s2">for the beauty of life and the desire to</p>
<p begin="03:20:37.210" end="03:20:42.400" style="s2">have their life be meaningful to life</p>
<p begin="03:20:39.880" end="03:20:45.370" style="s2">that my life ends but life of the</p>
<p begin="03:20:42.400" end="03:20:47.200" style="s2">capital L doesn&#39;t end and that life</p>
<p begin="03:20:45.370" end="03:20:49.720" style="s2">starts to be central to my awareness</p>
<p begin="03:20:47.200" end="03:20:51.600" style="s2">more than my life is and my life becomes</p>
<p begin="03:20:49.720" end="03:20:54.700" style="s2">meaningful and it&#39;s coupling to life</p>
<p begin="03:20:51.600" end="03:20:56.140" style="s2">this answers the sex question it also it</p>
<p begin="03:20:54.700" end="03:20:58.360" style="s2">answers all the other questions but I</p>
<p begin="03:20:56.140" end="03:21:01.330" style="s2">don&#39;t think there is a there to break</p>
<p begin="03:20:58.360" end="03:21:02.980" style="s2">through to yeah and the problem that</p>
<p begin="03:21:01.330" end="03:21:04.720" style="s2">we&#39;re having conceiving of it in your</p>
<p begin="03:21:02.980" end="03:21:06.160" style="s2">money now again I don&#39;t think this gets</p>
<p begin="03:21:04.720" end="03:21:08.439" style="s2">that of all the issues that I&#39;ve raised</p>
<p begin="03:21:06.160" end="03:21:11.130" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s the first point at</p>
<p begin="03:21:08.439" end="03:21:14.439" style="s2">which I start to see there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="03:21:11.130" end="03:21:18.010" style="s2">really different about your perspective</p>
<p begin="03:21:14.439" end="03:21:21.250" style="s2">so just as a slow learner if we take the</p>
<p begin="03:21:18.010" end="03:21:23.560" style="s2">kind of Gerardi an idea of all desire as</p>
<p begin="03:21:21.250" end="03:21:25.930" style="s2">mimetic and I&#39;m oversimplifying it but</p>
<p begin="03:21:23.560" end="03:21:29.950" style="s2">just meaning I want what other people</p>
<p begin="03:21:25.930" end="03:21:31.300" style="s2">have and then that inexorably causes</p>
<p begin="03:21:29.950" end="03:21:35.170" style="s2">conflict and then the conflict will</p>
<p begin="03:21:31.300" end="03:21:37.989" style="s2">inexorably cause violence I think there</p>
<p begin="03:21:35.170" end="03:21:39.939" style="s2">is statistical truth to all three of</p>
<p begin="03:21:37.989" end="03:21:43.930" style="s2">those steps but not inexorable truth to</p>
<p begin="03:21:39.939" end="03:21:47.649" style="s2">any of them mmm I don&#39;t only want things</p>
<p begin="03:21:43.930" end="03:21:50.920" style="s2">that other people have I you know or</p>
<p begin="03:21:47.649" end="03:21:53.470" style="s2">that I that I learned from other people</p>
<p begin="03:21:50.920" end="03:21:57.540" style="s2">there&#39;s there there are things that are</p>
<p begin="03:21:53.470" end="03:22:00.520" style="s2">just intrinsically fascinating to me or</p>
<p begin="03:21:57.540" end="03:22:02.410" style="s2">there are wanting for other people it is</p>
<p begin="03:22:00.520" end="03:22:03.880" style="s2">not wanting for myself anything in</p>
<p begin="03:22:02.410" end="03:22:05.229" style="s2">particular just actually caring about</p>
<p begin="03:22:03.880" end="03:22:07.090" style="s2">wanting for other people there are</p>
<p begin="03:22:05.229" end="03:22:09.100" style="s2">innate creative impulses where I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:22:07.090" end="03:22:11.050" style="s2">actually need to see and eat like I have</p>
<p begin="03:22:09.100" end="03:22:13.510" style="s2">a friend who is a savant pianist</p>
<p begin="03:22:11.050" end="03:22:15.189" style="s2">brilliant pianist and he almost never</p>
<p begin="03:22:13.510" end="03:22:17.560" style="s2">will play for anybody because his</p>
<p begin="03:22:15.189" end="03:22:19.590" style="s2">experience of playing is so beautiful</p>
<p begin="03:22:17.560" end="03:22:22.359" style="s2">that he doesn&#39;t want to cheapen it by</p>
<p begin="03:22:19.590" end="03:22:25.870" style="s2">having somebody else hear it and move</p>
<p begin="03:22:22.359" end="03:22:29.649" style="s2">into a performative place and it just is</p>
<p begin="03:22:25.870" end="03:22:32.229" style="s2">his own communion with music itself so I</p>
<p begin="03:22:29.649" end="03:22:34.510" style="s2">think there is desire that emerges from</p>
<p begin="03:22:32.229" end="03:22:37.120" style="s2">our connection to life not just the</p>
<p begin="03:22:34.510" end="03:22:38.950" style="s2">social layer and then even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="03:22:37.120" end="03:22:40.359" style="s2">doing something that I&#39;m inspired by and</p>
<p begin="03:22:38.950" end="03:22:42.430" style="s2">I want to do something like that too</p>
<p begin="03:22:40.359" end="03:22:44.439" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to create conflict I can</p>
<p begin="03:22:42.430" end="03:22:46.149" style="s2">be okay with you having something and</p>
<p begin="03:22:44.439" end="03:22:50.080" style="s2">want to share it or share in that type</p>
<p begin="03:22:46.149" end="03:22:53.560" style="s2">of phenomena yeah okay now I&#39;m starting</p>
<p begin="03:22:50.080" end="03:22:57.460" style="s2">to you know I have a friend for example</p>
<p begin="03:22:53.560" end="03:23:00.819" style="s2">who&#39;s a fantastic guitarist and I</p>
<p begin="03:22:57.460" end="03:23:05.410" style="s2">noticed that when we play together he</p>
<p begin="03:23:00.819" end="03:23:09.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t play at his peak ability because</p>
<p begin="03:23:05.410" end="03:23:14.020" style="s2">he wants the pleasure of playing</p>
<p begin="03:23:09.100" end="03:23:15.250" style="s2">together yeah to to be that the thing</p>
<p begin="03:23:14.020" end="03:23:17.521" style="s2">that we share if I was a better</p>
<p begin="03:23:15.250" end="03:23:20.431" style="s2">guitarist it would be more fun</p>
<p begin="03:23:17.521" end="03:23:23.961" style="s2">to trade things back and forth but the</p>
<p begin="03:23:20.431" end="03:23:28.110" style="s2">danger of going out of shared experience</p>
<p begin="03:23:23.961" end="03:23:30.511" style="s2">is far greater and so you know I yeah I</p>
<p begin="03:23:28.110" end="03:23:33.030" style="s2">I know the things that you are saying</p>

<p begin="03:23:33.030" end="03:23:39.631" style="s2">saying back to you could be retranslated</p>
<p begin="03:23:34.801" end="03:23:42.120" style="s2">as the transcendent beyond the proximate</p>
<p begin="03:23:39.631" end="03:23:46.381" style="s2">somatic pleasures that we have is so</p>
<p begin="03:23:42.120" end="03:23:49.471" style="s2">rarely experienced at scale it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="03:23:46.381" end="03:23:52.200" style="s2">experienced at scale well a little bits</p>
<p begin="03:23:49.471" end="03:23:54.961" style="s2">and religions in religion it happens I</p>
<p begin="03:23:52.200" end="03:23:56.431" style="s2">think that in in families there are</p>
<p begin="03:23:54.961" end="03:23:58.141" style="s2">things that people don&#39;t want to share</p>
<p begin="03:23:56.431" end="03:24:03.061" style="s2">outside of the family because they bond</p>
<p begin="03:23:58.141" end="03:24:05.070" style="s2">the family yeah and but it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="03:24:03.061" end="03:24:08.301" style="s2">hard to imagine a world in which people</p>
<p begin="03:24:05.070" end="03:24:12.751" style="s2">stop coveting their own name and lights</p>
<p begin="03:24:08.301" end="03:24:14.700" style="s2">you know people being impressed by by</p>
<p begin="03:24:12.751" end="03:24:16.440" style="s2">their car their yacht their house this</p>
<p begin="03:24:14.700" end="03:24:17.551" style="s2">than the other and I think that what</p>
<p begin="03:24:16.440" end="03:24:19.561" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="03:24:17.551" end="03:24:21.421" style="s2">not hard for me to imagine well this is</p>
<p begin="03:24:19.561" end="03:24:25.200" style="s2">the thing I mean the you know the odd</p>
<p begin="03:24:21.421" end="03:24:27.450" style="s2">thing that I have in being the friend</p>
<p begin="03:24:25.200" end="03:24:29.490" style="s2">and the employee of a billionaire is</p>
<p begin="03:24:27.450" end="03:24:32.190" style="s2">that I sometimes get to borrow his life</p>
<p begin="03:24:29.490" end="03:24:36.900" style="s2">yeah and you know he&#39;s made his home</p>
<p begin="03:24:32.190" end="03:24:39.961" style="s2">available to me in Hawaii for example</p>
<p begin="03:24:36.900" end="03:24:42.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s absolutely astounding to be in</p>
<p begin="03:24:39.961" end="03:24:43.650" style="s2">control of an asset like that I have</p>
<p begin="03:24:42.120" end="03:24:47.790" style="s2">another friend who lent me his Island</p>
<p begin="03:24:43.650" end="03:24:51.120" style="s2">year after year but I also found that I</p>
<p begin="03:24:47.790" end="03:24:53.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t want or need that and that both</p>
<p begin="03:24:51.120" end="03:24:56.400" style="s2">of these gentlemen that I&#39;m referring to</p>
<p begin="03:24:53.160" end="03:24:59.101" style="s2">were much more focused on ideas than</p>
<p begin="03:24:56.400" end="03:25:01.620" style="s2">they were on Faberge eggs or displaying</p>
<p begin="03:24:59.101" end="03:25:05.761" style="s2">a Picasso or anything like that because</p>
<p begin="03:25:01.620" end="03:25:08.370" style="s2">ultimately they found they wanted to go</p>
<p begin="03:25:05.761" end="03:25:10.980" style="s2">their association with me was let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="03:25:08.370" end="03:25:13.980" style="s2">about things that might move the needle</p>
<p begin="03:25:10.980" end="03:25:15.330" style="s2">in human history rather than do you have</p>
<p begin="03:25:13.980" end="03:25:20.070" style="s2">any idea how much this bottle of wine</p>
<p begin="03:25:15.330" end="03:25:22.950" style="s2">cost and remember I was saying earlier</p>
<p begin="03:25:20.070" end="03:25:25.711" style="s2">that I think dominant paradigms co-opted</p>
<p begin="03:25:22.950" end="03:25:27.961" style="s2">psychology to define healthy psychology</p>
<p begin="03:25:25.711" end="03:25:29.101" style="s2">as supportive of the paradigm so what</p>
<p begin="03:25:27.961" end="03:25:30.961" style="s2">I&#39;m about to say in terms of what I</p>
<p begin="03:25:29.101" end="03:25:31.271" style="s2">think healthy psychology is is not the</p>
<p begin="03:25:30.961" end="03:25:33.190" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="03:25:31.271" end="03:25:36.280" style="s2">definition of healthy psychology it is</p>
<p begin="03:25:33.190" end="03:25:38.440" style="s2">one that would be fit to a to an actuary</p>
<p begin="03:25:36.280" end="03:25:40.660" style="s2">viable civilization I think</p>
<p begin="03:25:38.440" end="03:25:44.320" style="s2">psychologically healthy humans are</p>
<p begin="03:25:40.660" end="03:25:46.301" style="s2">emotionally coupled to each other so 100</p>
<p begin="03:25:44.320" end="03:25:48.160" style="s2">percent so when you&#39;re happy I&#39;m happy</p>
<p begin="03:25:46.301" end="03:25:49.780" style="s2">I&#39;m stoked for you if you&#39;re hurting I</p>
<p begin="03:25:48.160" end="03:25:54.070" style="s2">feel that I feel compassion and empathy</p>
<p begin="03:25:49.780" end="03:25:58.990" style="s2">I think the worst psychology is the</p>
<p begin="03:25:54.070" end="03:26:00.910" style="s2">inversion of sadism where I feel joy at</p>
<p begin="03:25:58.990" end="03:26:02.591" style="s2">your pain rather than joy your joy and</p>
<p begin="03:26:00.910" end="03:26:05.830" style="s2">we know your pain I think is a French</p>
<p begin="03:26:02.591" end="03:26:08.141" style="s2">expression is not sufficient that one</p>
<p begin="03:26:05.830" end="03:26:12.461" style="s2">succeed in life one&#39;s friends must also</p>
<p begin="03:26:08.141" end="03:26:13.811" style="s2">fail yeah so that is a perfect statement</p>
<p begin="03:26:12.461" end="03:26:16.601" style="s2">of what is most wrong with the world</p>
<p begin="03:26:13.811" end="03:26:19.751" style="s2">right that&#39;s that that is the heart of</p>
<p begin="03:26:16.601" end="03:26:22.601" style="s2">the worst part of game a but I think</p>
<p begin="03:26:19.751" end="03:26:25.211" style="s2">jealousy is one step away from sadism</p>
<p begin="03:26:22.601" end="03:26:25.900" style="s2">because if sadism is I feel joy at your</p>
<p begin="03:26:25.211" end="03:26:28.120" style="s2">pain</p>
<p begin="03:26:25.900" end="03:26:31.631" style="s2">jealousy is I feel pain at your joy or</p>
<p begin="03:26:28.120" end="03:26:33.601" style="s2">your success or envy right and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:26:31.631" end="03:26:37.900" style="s2">think that is a psychologically healthy</p>
<p begin="03:26:33.601" end="03:26:39.851" style="s2">place for people I think it is a largely</p>
<p begin="03:26:37.900" end="03:26:41.440" style="s2">we condition this because we watch</p>
<p begin="03:26:39.851" end="03:26:43.450" style="s2">movies where we celebrate when the bad</p>
<p begin="03:26:41.440" end="03:26:44.921" style="s2">guy gets it right and we condition the</p>
<p begin="03:26:43.450" end="03:26:46.421" style="s2"> out of we celebrate when the bad</p>
<p begin="03:26:44.921" end="03:26:48.190" style="s2">guy gets and we celebrate when our team</p>
<p begin="03:26:46.421" end="03:26:50.561" style="s2">wins and the other team loses so we can</p>
<p begin="03:26:48.190" end="03:26:52.841" style="s2">collectively decoupler empathy from</p>
<p begin="03:26:50.561" end="03:26:54.271" style="s2">other human beings arbitrarily so that</p>
<p begin="03:26:52.841" end="03:26:56.230" style="s2">we can then feel good in a war</p>
<p begin="03:26:54.271" end="03:26:59.320" style="s2">supporting you know when that type of</p>
<p begin="03:26:56.230" end="03:27:01.360" style="s2">thing occurs and we get conditioned that</p>
<p begin="03:26:59.320" end="03:27:03.730" style="s2">second place is the first loser and all</p>
<p begin="03:27:01.360" end="03:27:05.620" style="s2">those types of things but this is</p>
<p begin="03:27:03.730" end="03:27:07.511" style="s2">conditioning again and conditioning of a</p>
<p begin="03:27:05.620" end="03:27:09.881" style="s2">highly neuro plastic species so I think</p>
<p begin="03:27:07.511" end="03:27:11.711" style="s2">our intuitions are all bad if we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="03:27:09.881" end="03:27:13.330" style="s2">spent I&#39;m really questioning these</p>
<p begin="03:27:11.711" end="03:27:15.851" style="s2">things and then also looking at cultural</p>
<p begin="03:27:13.330" end="03:27:19.330" style="s2">outliers because I don&#39;t think any of</p>
<p begin="03:27:15.851" end="03:27:21.311" style="s2">this is inexorable is it is it Oh bik WA</p>
<p begin="03:27:19.330" end="03:27:22.721" style="s2">tiss yes is it an extra bone oh but I</p>
<p begin="03:27:21.311" end="03:27:23.740" style="s2">think what is ubiquitous is</p>
<p begin="03:27:22.721" end="03:27:25.900" style="s2">psychopathology</p>
<p begin="03:27:23.740" end="03:27:28.301" style="s2">well Daniel I think what I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="03:27:25.900" end="03:27:31.450" style="s2">from our conversation is is that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="03:27:28.301" end="03:27:33.971" style="s2">got a lot of examples that are at the</p>
<p begin="03:27:31.450" end="03:27:35.561" style="s2">proof-of-concept level of things that</p>
<p begin="03:27:33.971" end="03:27:37.061" style="s2">are under exploited you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="03:27:35.561" end="03:27:40.511" style="s2">observation that we&#39;re far off the</p>
<p begin="03:27:37.061" end="03:27:44.530" style="s2">efficient frontier that there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="03:27:40.511" end="03:27:44.800" style="s2">giant overlooked opportunity which is</p>
<p begin="03:27:44.530" end="03:27:47.740" style="s2">the</p>

<p begin="03:27:51.160" end="03:27:55.390" style="s2">thirteen could be used for something</p>
<p begin="03:27:53.649" end="03:27:58.210" style="s2">radically different which i think is the</p>
<p begin="03:27:55.390" end="03:28:01.390" style="s2">the biggest hope in your whole complex</p>
<p begin="03:27:58.210" end="03:28:04.780" style="s2">of ideas together with the idea that</p>
<p begin="03:28:01.390" end="03:28:07.000" style="s2">there are realms beyond somatic pleasure</p>
<p begin="03:28:04.780" end="03:28:09.880" style="s2">that most of us spend our entire lives</p>
<p begin="03:28:07.000" end="03:28:13.240" style="s2">not knowing what it&#39;s like to break</p>
<p begin="03:28:09.880" end="03:28:16.660" style="s2">through the status and wealth and</p>
<p begin="03:28:13.240" end="03:28:18.300" style="s2">security games and effectively we have</p>
<p begin="03:28:16.660" end="03:28:21.910" style="s2">no idea at the top of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="03:28:18.300" end="03:28:24.760" style="s2">when fully realized is and that it might</p>
<p begin="03:28:21.910" end="03:28:26.950" style="s2">be possible to at least begin the game</p>
<p begin="03:28:24.760" end="03:28:29.410" style="s2">to buy us some time to try to figure out</p>
<p begin="03:28:26.950" end="03:28:33.340" style="s2">what we would do at scale now I still</p>
<p begin="03:28:29.410" end="03:28:35.439" style="s2">don&#39;t see any world in which we can</p>
<p begin="03:28:33.340" end="03:28:37.030" style="s2">defeat all these multipolar traps but I</p>
<p begin="03:28:35.439" end="03:28:39.670" style="s2">think what you&#39;re really saying to me</p>
<p begin="03:28:37.030" end="03:28:45.040" style="s2">again always correct me if I&#39;m wrong is</p>
<p begin="03:28:39.670" end="03:28:48.250" style="s2">that we could potentially change what</p>
<p begin="03:28:45.040" end="03:28:50.500" style="s2">winning feels like and that when we do</p>
<p begin="03:28:48.250" end="03:28:52.359" style="s2">that then this prisoner&#39;s dilemma is</p>
<p begin="03:28:50.500" end="03:28:56.109" style="s2">don&#39;t look right any longer because I no</p>

<p begin="03:29:01.540" end="03:29:05.410" style="s2">jail term and we have to remove the</p>

<p begin="03:29:45.189" end="03:29:50.590" style="s2">have a system like a corporation where</p>
<p begin="03:29:47.830" end="03:29:52.960" style="s2">my playing by the rules fully gets me</p>

<p begin="03:31:37.480" end="03:31:44.881" style="s2">with us here on the portal and just</p>
<p begin="03:31:39.940" end="03:31:47.410" style="s2">briefly I want to say I think that I</p>
<p begin="03:31:44.881" end="03:31:52.330" style="s2">think that you&#39;re doing this is awesome</p>
<p begin="03:31:47.410" end="03:31:55.450" style="s2">I you know there there are people who</p>
<p begin="03:31:52.330" end="03:31:57.670" style="s2">say we need divergent ideas and</p>
<p begin="03:31:55.450" end="03:32:00.370" style="s2">heterodox ideas but that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="03:31:57.670" end="03:32:02.801" style="s2">grounded clear thinking and you know</p>
<p begin="03:32:00.370" end="03:32:06.101" style="s2">critical thinking and I think for you to</p>
<p begin="03:32:02.801" end="03:32:08.051" style="s2">bring heterodox thinkers and have but</p>
<p begin="03:32:06.101" end="03:32:10.660" style="s2">not just agree with them but have real</p>
<p begin="03:32:08.051" end="03:32:11.750" style="s2">dialectic conversation that is earnestly</p>
<p begin="03:32:10.660" end="03:32:14.600" style="s2">seeking to bring about</p>
<p begin="03:32:11.750" end="03:32:15.980" style="s2">better understanding is beautiful I was</p>
<p begin="03:32:14.600" end="03:32:20.180" style="s2">really excited about that</p>
<p begin="03:32:15.980" end="03:32:22.010" style="s2">I I wish that I could have communicated</p>
<p begin="03:32:20.180" end="03:32:23.960" style="s2">clearer having had better sleep last</p>
<p begin="03:32:22.010" end="03:32:26.960" style="s2">night but hopefully it wasn&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="03:32:23.960" end="03:32:28.970" style="s2">unintelligible well I traveled from San</p>
<p begin="03:32:26.960" end="03:32:30.440" style="s2">Francisco to do this and so I think I</p>
<p begin="03:32:28.970" end="03:32:32.990" style="s2">was probably a little off my game at</p>
<p begin="03:32:30.440" end="03:32:34.630" style="s2">particularly at the beginning but we can</p>
<p begin="03:32:32.990" end="03:32:37.310" style="s2">do this again and I just want to say</p>

<p begin="03:32:37.310" end="03:32:41.420" style="s2">words I&#39;ll take them to heart I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="03:32:39.620" end="03:32:44.150" style="s2">to get courage myself to do a little bit</p>
<p begin="03:32:41.420" end="03:32:45.830" style="s2">more in this space and so far I got to</p>
