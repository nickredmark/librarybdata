<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:04.000" style="s2">something that i think will reflect</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">um a kind of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.000" end="00:01:08.080" style="s2">we could say a new a paradigm a new the</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">new paradigm let&#39;s have media the new</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.080" end="00:01:12.880" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">of online you know information</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.880" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">uh ideas something that&#39;s removed from</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:21.439" style="s2">from woke that&#39;s removed from censorship</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">which is you know open and</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.439" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">and interesting and we&#39;re all i think</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">i think right uh if everybody would</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">agree with that so i thought of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">i thought of uh you know framing this</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">discussion as being a discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">what is this this new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:42.720" style="s2">right what is this what is this</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say kind of shifting uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.720" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">ambiguous space that we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.680" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">and uh tom is often speaking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.680" end="00:01:52.000" style="s2">post-post-modernism what&#39;s after</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.000" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">uh on our site we often talk about uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:59.520" style="s2">the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">from the big media platforms um</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.520" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a term that me and alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">use a lot uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">how to create the next exodus um we also</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:08.239" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:09.759" style="s2">other terms that we you know we throw</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.239" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">around in our circles one is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.759" end="00:02:13.520" style="s2">is called the renaissance so we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">talking about the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.520" end="00:02:16.560" style="s2">from the big social media platforms</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;ve also been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.560" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">the renaissance and in in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.800" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">rediscovering let&#39;s say more primordial</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.959" style="s2">notions and ideas and thoughts and um</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:28.239" style="s2">and also in the last conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.959" end="00:02:28.959" style="s2">thought it might be interesting to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.239" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">alchemy which i believe i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">daniel you have an interest in that and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">at least i do and that might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">also a subject of conversation so does</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">anybody want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">riff on on my introduction on what am</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:50.480" style="s2">what i was going here</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">yeah let me pick up on that so totally</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.480" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">it does feel like we&#39;re at the end</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">of a time period of an age right um</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of conversations talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">about post-post-modernism trans</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">modernism metamodernism what what do we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:07.360" style="s2">call that which we are living in today</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">um i think the way that i would connect</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.360" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">that to perhaps alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">and would be something like you know one</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:16.480" style="s2">of the things that alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">does as far as i can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.480" end="00:03:21.680" style="s2">it works with the prime matter that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">human perception and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.680" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">that i contend is that time is a feature</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">of human perception not of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">reality so when we&#39;re talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">comes after post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">we&#39;re assuming linear time</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">but to me the question is more like</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">who is capable of actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">putting down the foundations for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.120" style="s2">which comes after post-modernism because</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">one of the features of postmodernism as</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.120" end="00:03:50.720" style="s2">i guess we all kind of understand is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s saturated</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.720" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the end of everything nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">new everything is in decay</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.640" style="s2">late civilizational decay right a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">bit like the dark ages or</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.360" style="s2">late rome and i feel like the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">put down the foundations for something</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.360" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">new is kind of what we are all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">to name it precociously is perhaps less</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">interesting than</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">talking about how it can come to be and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s i guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">our interest in in alchemy especially in</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">the age of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">of digital technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:25.120" style="s2">okay oh and you have anything to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">about that you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.120" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">i think yeah like i might zoom back to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:34.240" style="s2">one of the things you said when you just</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">started off about this um</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.240" end="00:04:37.680" style="s2">what this new paradigm kind of looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:40.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.680" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">and i think the way i always conceive</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.320" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">about this it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the media first it&#39;s this new</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:49.840" style="s2">information communication technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.840" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">really changed things um</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:57.360" style="s2">the essay to read to start thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">about this way</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.360" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">is um is jordan hall&#39;s essays which are</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">pretty much like</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">classic by now in whatever bubble this</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">theological question so in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">that perhaps at the</p>

<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">um there was a theological transition of</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">and one of the things that i contend is</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">it is the prerogative and the mission</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">is the way to go that that future is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:49.600" style="s2">really about maximizing pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">reducing pain and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.600" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">put down certain guidelines that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">sort of the dogmas of the age right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">um dugan criticizes this obviously from</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">his point of view but the critique</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">is nonetheless notable when he he says</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">century of the blue church includes</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">human rights like the dogmatic category</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">of the individual which is so</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">uh that we cannot even conceive of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.440" end="00:12:18.320" style="s2">because we are to it like fish are too</p>

<p begin="00:12:18.320" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">we don&#39;t you know in other times and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">other places people might consider the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">world to be based around</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">rather than just trying to get your</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">exactly and and this is not even i would</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">sort of expand on that and say that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">to say individual as a word is already a</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:21.279" style="s2">really going to the depth of really how</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">are we even talking about these things</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">let&#39;s question them</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:26.800" style="s2">more deeply uh and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">unasked questions behind the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.800" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">you know the emergence of something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">it&#39;s its consequences leading up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">today and sort of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">warfare situation that we include</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:39.600" style="s2">ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">and so that&#39;s why owen and i always come</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.600" end="00:13:43.600" style="s2">back again to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">this idea of alchemy this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.600" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">ontological designing</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.519" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">as a potential solution because it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">the theological dogmas that frame how we</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">ourselves subjects are something that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">is in crisis and we need to step up and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.680" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">with with platforms and conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">to really try to not only figure out</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">what might be a way that we could share</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">but even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:14.560" style="s2">the way we talk about that is generative</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">ontologically</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.560" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">i want to know a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">you mean by alchemy um</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.199" style="s2">because alchemy is is normally</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">considered sort of a prototype of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.199" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">science and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">full of all kinds of superstition and</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">that but i</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">i think the appeal of alchemy is that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">you can play more it&#39;s not so reductive</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">as as</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">you know mechanical science uh uh can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">in other words</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">it it it it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">the imaginative aspect is your the</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">subjective imaginative aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">included</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:50.160" style="s2">you know in the experiment right</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">uh uh with with the objects um</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.160" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">so so so the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">we use the term alchemy is in a way kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">uh interchangeable with ontological</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">design which is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">we are performing changes in perception</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">and and the subjectivity of the being</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.760" end="00:15:09.279" style="s2">itself and by framing perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">individual within a set of relationships</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.840" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">the idea of artistically mediated belief</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">right uh and i think that it gets a</p>

<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">something other you are pretending in a</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">and i think that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.360" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">anti-hydarian or something right</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.919" style="s2">heidegger was always talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.760" style="s2">what is it that the word the german word</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">live that we create these spiritual mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.000" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">temples that we&#39;re supposed to inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.039" style="s2">and the thing that i would bring up is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.039" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">theological ability capacity talents</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">resources to be able to create these say</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">performances worth living is um</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">is pretty [ __ ] big and scary and hard</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very pathetic it lies behind the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">bard absolute it is not for those who</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">it is not for the many it is for the few</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">and i&#39;m not really even sure</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">that um i&#39;d like to sort of pierce that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.200" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">fail and then put my head through that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">right even nietzsche said something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">for the lovers of the light</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">stay in the shadow something like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.320" style="s2">so point being</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s very serious to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.320" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">time mind temples within which we might</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">live which is perhaps the task that</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:22:59.760" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">collectively trying to address uh as</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.760" end="00:23:04.320" style="s2">we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">past the time horizon of the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.320" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">whatever postmodernism represents</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">um yeah that was well said i i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">seriousness you&#39;re talking about often</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">gets forgotten you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">when we speak about all these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">because they&#39;re so salient and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">you know attractive and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:22.480" style="s2">this bright light pulling us towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">something and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.480" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">um it&#39;s incredibly hard we have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">kind of uh i don&#39;t know we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">able to stand like</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">i&#39;m speaking a bit metaphorically here i</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:35.919" style="s2">feel forgiving but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:38.559" style="s2">we have to kind of stand in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.919" end="00:23:39.840" style="s2">of the chaos and not be you know torn to</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.559" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">pieces</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.840" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">if that makes any sense that&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">yeah i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:46.240" style="s2">the idea that&#39;s come up the images</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">coming into my head about this</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.240" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">performatism</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">is like the distinction say between</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">let&#39;s say like</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.320" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">guns and roses going up and performing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">as guns and roses and slash an axle</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">slash an axle versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">some cover band going up and performing</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">as like guns two roses and putting on a</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">wig to look like the front man and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">look like the lead guitarist</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.880" end="00:24:06.880" style="s2">you know the second one are doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">performance of performance there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.880" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">a second order mimeticism there</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">whereas like the uh in the former case</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">like guns and roses</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">are actually doing the real thing they</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">are just expressing themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">artistically</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">so they are performing but they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">it in a way that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:25.520" style="s2">that is that is the expression where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">the second order performance is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.520" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">performing as them does that make some</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">sense oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:32.640" style="s2">well well i think the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">about what you&#39;re saying i mean if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.640" end="00:24:35.840" style="s2">if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">rolling stones and you&#39;re singing for 40</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.840" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">years satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">i i wouldn&#39;t describe there a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">no more meaning than if some cover band</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">would do it because it&#39;s devoid of any</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">meaning at that point</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right so but there what what</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">i wanted to say there</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">like different definitions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.120" style="s2">performatism and i don&#39;t know but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:57.360" style="s2">it&#39;s unattended here but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.120" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">performance you speak of you perform as</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.360" end="00:24:59.760" style="s2">a band</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">made like a cover band then you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.760" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">like the post-modern notion of it</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:05.039" style="s2">where you can like in in a butlerian way</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.480" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.039" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">uh perform agenda by by now</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.480" end="00:25:11.760" style="s2">announcing it by a woman giving birth</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.760" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">as a speech act and then you have this</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:19.679" style="s2">postmodern notion of performatism why</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">where you are engaging say with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.679" end="00:25:25.679" style="s2">with an artifact with a piece of art and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">you&#39;re creating some new</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.679" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">world view or some new experience or</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">some new</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">form of looking looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">with the world in this height</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">heideggerian sense and so these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">different notions of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:40.480" style="s2">what performance yeah and so it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.480" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">well but back to guns and roses um i</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">i think that um the the trick is or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">difficulty is</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">is that in the beginning you have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">you have this inspiration that comes</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">kind of from</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">a primordial place and you take a risk</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">and you put yourself out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">and then you become a caricature of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">yourself afterwards right</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">uh you become a you you just and you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">further and further from that state</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">of uh you know inspiration which never</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">you know the ends off in the jewish</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:14.000" style="s2">tradition means without</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">end right or the you know uh this this</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.000" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">this state of creativity without end and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">i think the alchemical</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:23.039" style="s2">task is is tapping into that state</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:24.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very hard when you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.039" end="00:26:27.120" style="s2">with structures right because</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.880" end="00:26:28.559" style="s2">because because you get attached to a</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.120" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">structure and that structure becomes</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.559" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">reified</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:34.480" style="s2">and you know you get some some you get</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">some feedback by and then the structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.480" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">starts to take to take you over so</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:39.760" style="s2">maybe um the art of making a structure</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.760" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">that that works um is finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.360" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">to to keep that ever that that ends off</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">spirit without end you know let me riff</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.760" style="s2">on that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.039" style="s2">performance uh irving goffman this</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.760" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">canadian guy</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.039" end="00:26:59.039" style="s2">uh used to talk about performances as</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">being this ubiquitous element of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.039" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">everyday life when you go to a pharmacy</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">to buy some</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">medicine uh it&#39;s it&#39;s normal that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">people there sometimes are wearing like</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">white robes but why they don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re not in the lab it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:12.080" style="s2">performative aspect so do priests</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s it really has this charge</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.080" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">of being a prop in a ritual</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">or the front or a setting in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">performance</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">right uh the performances of everyday</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">life great book and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:26.960" style="s2">they actually um have a function which</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.760" style="s2">is a function to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.960" end="00:27:31.120" style="s2">the flows and perhaps the let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.760" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.120" end="00:27:35.360" style="s2">extended shared libidinal economy the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">meaning economy of everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.360" end="00:27:38.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason why they wear a coat</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:39.679" style="s2">because there&#39;s a charge of credibility</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">to it because there&#39;s a charge of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.679" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">hygiene cleanliness etc but you pointed</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">to something really cool</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.520" style="s2">which was like um talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">not so much the functional profane</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.520" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">rituals and the performances</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">like you know going to a pharmacy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">getting some medicine and the guy being</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:56.640" style="s2">wearing a white robe</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">but the the other perhaps more spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.640" end="00:28:01.600" style="s2">uh or more meaning dense</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">performances so the other day i went to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.600" end="00:28:07.919" style="s2">a church here in gdansk in</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">in poland and i was amazed that how</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.919" end="00:28:11.360" style="s2">you know throughout europe time and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">again you find these amazing cathedrals</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.360" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">these these huge buildings</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">with with such holiness with such charge</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">uh and i was talking to my friend and i</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">you know i&#39;m i&#39;m i was</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">sort of reinforcing that spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.120" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">charge of the place that that beauty of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">the place then he made a very good point</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">yeah but um do you think everyone who</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">went to church and goes to church</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.720" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">actually understands</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:41.120" style="s2">the depth of the spirituality as you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">trying to explain right now or</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.120" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">did they just follow the ritual because</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">everyone else did it and just followed</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:47.520" style="s2">the exoteric</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">part of the doctrine without really</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.520" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">understanding the esoteric part of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great point so you alluded</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">to that andrew which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">i would say the following uh it is for</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:02.480" style="s2">the few to understand the esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">to be the channelers of the paints off</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.480" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">the dimensions and to craft that into</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:08.640" style="s2">exoteric symbols</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">that then you know if they&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.640" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">crafted enough then perhaps you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">actually building a holy word building a</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">temple building a symbolic house where</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.600" style="s2">everyone else can live now</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:18.799" style="s2">if there&#39;s no holiness at the core then</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.600" end="00:29:20.799" style="s2">god has left the temple</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.799" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">he will not return and all that&#39;s left</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">is rot and ruins and the desert</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">coming over and covering up the sphinx</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">yeah whilst popping yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.880" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">your mention of the church brings up</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:36.559" style="s2">something which is a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">difficulty in the design of society&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.559" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">big and small and indeed</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:41.520" style="s2">cultures and subculture</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.840" end="00:29:48.799" style="s2">cults which is that the strength of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.799" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">is something like equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">amount of authenticity that each of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:56.159" style="s2">top participants brings to it</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">and the larger it gets the more it</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.159" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">scales the more people</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:01.919" style="s2">will end up showing up for just this</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">like social decorum for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.919" end="00:30:05.679" style="s2">going to church because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">do when you go to church</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.679" end="00:30:10.720" style="s2">or going to work because you get paid to</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">go to work and responsibly you know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.720" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">go to a job interview and they say</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">why do you want to work in this job and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">you come up with some [ __ ] reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">about how you&#39;ve always wanted to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">chef</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">or a a teacher but the truth is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">well in most cases it&#39;s because i i need</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">to earn money</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">and now i need to say something good to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">make you think that i&#39;m at least good</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:32.399" style="s2">enough at lying so that other people</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">will believe that i want to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.399" end="00:30:36.799" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:38.960" style="s2">whereas building a a</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.799" end="00:30:40.480" style="s2">the advantage of building a small sector</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.960" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">a secret society</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.480" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">and i believe this is the reason the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">secret societies have existed throughout</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:49.360" style="s2">to create a little closed container</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">where the</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">libido energy and attraction is such</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">is devoting a lot of themselves to what</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:31:01.279" style="s2">might be achieved in that space</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:02.799" style="s2">yeah and well it&#39;s true that the um the</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.279" end="00:31:05.039" style="s2">esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.799" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">uh is always uh you know governed by a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.039" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">certain kind of elitism</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">right it&#39;s iliteraterian if that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not egalitarian and it never can be</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">that&#39;s just the way it is because</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s only a certain amount of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:22.320" style="s2">that want to step that close to the fire</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.960" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">right so so so so</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.320" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">in in a traditional society people would</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">you know they would they would</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:30.880" style="s2">understand uh that you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">you&#39;re cut out for that or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re not cut out for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">you do other things and you you have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">ordinary life</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">and you know within the realm but there</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">there is a central core there is as as</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">you express so well daniel there is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">kind of burning</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s this hearth and there&#39;s fire</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">that that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">that you you you are receiving the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">blessings from from from</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">from that just just just by being a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:31:59.679" style="s2">person or doing whatever you do</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">um but the problem today is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.679" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">everybody wants to kind of get into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:05.600" style="s2">esoteric</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">uh and nobody wants to to do the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.600" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">preliminaries the steps that that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">required</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">to become there so everybody thinks you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">have access to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">to uh i don&#39;t know maybe maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m being you know conservative</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">when i&#39;m talking like that or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">i agree with you i think you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:23.679" style="s2">pragmatic let me</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">throw something to that which i wholly</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.679" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">agree with what you said right there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">here&#39;s a thought there&#39;s perhaps two</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">ways to address or to reach</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">um this inner burning core or rather to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">reach the core</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">of the alchemical pursuit one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:38.640" style="s2">through heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">because of the law of equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.640" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">exchange right there&#39;s no free lunch you</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">have to get something in return and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:44.880" style="s2">can give a lot of time a lot of effort</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:46.399" style="s2">time is the only wealth that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">can be one of two types that</p>

<p begin="00:34:07.120" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">you know in the more archaic religions</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.000" style="s2">uh you would do this cheap thing where</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">in order to pay that debt right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.399" style="s2">to tie back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">to tom and parallax uh you know we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.919" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">else that is out there for the sake of</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.000" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">some personal gain</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">is rampant and it gets chaotic because</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">you want to burn the collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.240" end="00:34:38.960" style="s2">accumulated capital of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">the sacrifices of you know a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s something to be gained out</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">of that perhaps more instantly but</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the fire that burns very</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">brightly but perhaps does not sustain</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:55.440" style="s2">does that make sense yeah uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:58.480" style="s2">well the fact that it doesn&#39;t sustain</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.440" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">itself i think it does sustain itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.480" end="00:35:02.000" style="s2">but but it doesn&#39;t need it doesn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">mean it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.000" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">already present in everything</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">but but it it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a human life</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">that burns itself out</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">somehow um or at least it burns itself</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">until there&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:19.920" style="s2">anything to burn uh elephant levi</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">this occultist mentioned in one of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.920" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">books like the history of magic i think</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:27.119" style="s2">you know uh at the time when the the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:29.839" style="s2">jews were prisoners in babylon</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.119" end="00:35:30.160" style="s2">there were these babylonian kings who</p>

<p begin="00:35:30.160" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">i think the magi and i&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">relate the story and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">probably butchering them but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">was that they knew or someone there was</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.119" style="s2">warned that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">cyrus quote unquote the great was</p>

<p begin="00:35:46.640" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">but they chose to do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">i think was the prophet daniel who</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">warned them and they chose to do nothing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">to throw they instead chose to throw</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">to go out in a dying bang and an orgy</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">that immediately</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">lights so bright that even the skies</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:05.119" style="s2">looked like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">they were day and it was actually the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.119" end="00:36:06.880" style="s2">night something like that and then they</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:08.960" style="s2">died</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.880" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">and with them all their secrets and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.960" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">kind of happened again in the fall of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">rome again right</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">you can you can there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">early stage civilizations mid-stage</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:20.000" style="s2">civilizations there&#39;s late-stage</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">civilizations uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.000" end="00:36:23.520" style="s2">everything has kind of this life cycle</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">the word life being essential here</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.520" end="00:36:27.040" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what we&#39;re navigating</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.040" end="00:36:30.800" style="s2">honestly at this point in history</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">yeah do you hear me do you hear me with</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:38.400" style="s2">with my phone now</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">yeah yeah all right that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.079" style="s2">something that dr murray said in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">in the podcast yesterday let me come</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.079" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">back to that because he said</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">uh historically speaking it&#39;s a sign of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">end of a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:55.599" style="s2">if topics like identity politics and uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:57.920" style="s2">trans issues take uh uh first ring</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:36:59.200" style="s2">amongst other things you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s like you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.200" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">when the uh greek empire</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.200" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">fall fell and and their</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:11.280" style="s2">emphasis on on you know gender topics at</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">that time and so that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.280" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">and yeah i thought well just just you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.119" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">know everything splinters into into</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:20.640" style="s2">little you know groups and factions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">tribes and exactly yes and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.640" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">everybody&#39;s at each other&#39;s throat</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the war of all against war i i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:28.079" style="s2">war of all against all</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">but i wonder i wonder why that what what</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.079" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">gender has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:32.160" style="s2">do with that that that&#39;s that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.160" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">i think it has to do with the uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">technology has a role to play in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">i&#39;m going to connect mark fisher and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:41.119" style="s2">occultism so</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">he did it already whatever but like</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.119" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">hauntology this idea that we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">haunted by the fantasies or in french</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">fantasma</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">of um surplus libido that finds no</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">to be held with it and when that vessel</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">is broken</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">vessels that are uh for example power</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">apparatuses in society institutions like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">marriage</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">or things like old gender roles they</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">were vessels vessels have the property</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">to constrain and oppress but they also</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">hold something together when you break</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:13.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like the pandora&#39;s box is open the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.920" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">yeah the pattern it goes wide open at</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">the moment right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:23.599" style="s2">if you can deconstruct the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">if you can deconstruct the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.599" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">perceptions we have</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:31.520" style="s2">like uh we are for men and not for</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">like uh other identities and</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.520" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">and disrupt that kind of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">then you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">deconstruct basically everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:40.079" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">and that is a demonic force in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.079" end="00:38:44.160" style="s2">sense because it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a process of continual</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.160" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">and uh and and you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.920" style="s2">and and ripping apart people&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:55.599" style="s2">common sense axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.920" end="00:38:57.839" style="s2">views of themselves you know ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.599" end="00:39:01.680" style="s2">people in the world being</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.839" end="00:39:03.680" style="s2">you know assaulted by subhuman messaging</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.680" end="00:39:06.240" style="s2">on some level you know that makes them</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.680" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">doubt everything about themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.240" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">you know from their health to their sex</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">to you know whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">precisely yeah well look the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">contemporary capitalist society mark</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">fisher makes this point in capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.359" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">reasonism i think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">very essentially unsatisfying</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">like never before has bad subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">in the lacanian sense been more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:31.520" style="s2">felt by people and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">they&#39;re clinging for something that</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.520" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">feels</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">real that feels legit that feels</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">authentic and</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">like gender is one of the oldest things</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:44.480" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">capitalism it predates feudalism it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.480" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">predates tribalism basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.480" end="00:39:50.960" style="s2">and and it&#39;s also worth pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">that actually us guys here we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.960" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">quite interested like andrew and i both</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:55.839" style="s2">involved with the men&#39;s movement tom</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t know quite how connected with</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.839" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">you you are as well but fragger like</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">daniel i&#39;ve mentioned it to you a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:03.280" style="s2">of times it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">there is also a positive project along</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.280" end="00:40:06.319" style="s2">these alignment of gender lines it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">like we&#39;re not standing here</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">observing that that the current point is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">devol or devolving and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:17.359" style="s2">collapsing the people bickering about</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">genders but there is also something very</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.359" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">real about that gender polarity that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">investigated and primed into you know we</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">also see</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:28.960" style="s2">um andrew you just spoke to rachel</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">haywire and</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.960" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">raven connolly right like they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">this project like</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">the philosopher queens which i find</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">super interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">main part just because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">male voices in this space doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">philosophy work and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">i&#39;m intrigued to see what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">femininity they might be able to uncover</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">that goes beyond the the identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:52.480" style="s2">feminism</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:53.839" style="s2">not feminism but female perspective</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.480" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">mm-hmm yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.839" end="00:40:57.599" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah there&#39;s a few things to</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">say about that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.599" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">is um in the state of total</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:02.880" style="s2">fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">you know people just you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.880" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">the war of all against all and</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">and and and there&#39;s the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:10.560" style="s2">society falling apart</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">but then there&#39;s you know first</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.560" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">mountains and rivers are mountains</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">rivers then they&#39;re not and then they</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:16.319" style="s2">have to become mountains and rivers</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:18.400" style="s2">again with a capital m and a capital r</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.319" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">right they have to so we have that there</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.400" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">has to be a new synthesis right i guess</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:25.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a hegelian thing as well right</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">within that negativity there has to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.280" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">new synthesis so there has to be um</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.599" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">a new concretion or or you know using</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">this hegelian language of something</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:34.640" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">which would be it would it would be it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.640" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">would be both a return</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:39.920" style="s2">and it would also it would also be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">path forward</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.920" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">and me and alexander have been speaking</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">of this as being the exodus myth</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">in a sense that&#39;s what the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:51.599" style="s2">missing in exodus myth like a way out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:54.800" style="s2">this you could say identitarian</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.599" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">uh you know uh you know stomach eating</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.800" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">itself or</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">brain eating itself or zombie kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:01.200" style="s2">apocalypse or whatever you want to call</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:04.480" style="s2">it it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">a a landscape of total nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.480" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">uh and then and then um and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">so there is this need to rediscover uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">the exodus myth</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">yeah and you don&#39;t have that and what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:18.560" style="s2">mean by the exodus myth is</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">not necessarily a there&#39;s a social level</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.560" end="00:42:20.720" style="s2">to that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:22.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an inner outer and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.720" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">secret level to that you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.640" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s the getting out</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">of the the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">present paradigm and then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">you know liberating</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">yourself in some kind of way so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">actually have a constructive view and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:37.280" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:37.839" style="s2">forward vision and how to have a have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.839" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">have to have discovered a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">constructive meaning and mission in your</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">life which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:49.760" style="s2">you know we talk about as being the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">phallic um</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.760" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">which is very counter-intuitive to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">the discourse that&#39;s out there which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:58.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:43:00.960" style="s2">is all about sort of um</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.160" end="00:43:03.359" style="s2">sort of you know healing our you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.960" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">healing our wounds</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.359" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">yeah i think right if i if i if i may</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:09.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">that i was thinking about all day you</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.280" end="00:43:13.599" style="s2">know i was partaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">at some forum metamodern forum and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.599" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">there was a question you know what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">and you know it was all you know about</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">oscillating i</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">i will fit this in in our uh current</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">conversations like what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">meta-modernism it&#39;s an oscillation</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">between you know modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.720" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:33.200" style="s2">and and you know the the the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.720" end="00:43:33.760" style="s2">the paradigm is pretty similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.200" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">wilbur</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.760" end="00:43:37.119" style="s2">was doing the integrating what what came</p>

<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">but you know my my my impulse but my</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">is is that you know additionally to the</p>

<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">but you know if you talk about emergence</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s still something there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">and you don&#39;t understand it but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:21.680" style="s2">new paradigm and you can&#39;t really</p>

<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">aspect of emergence is kind of missing</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">you have to integrate modernism the good</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:50.720" style="s2">post modern didn&#39;t really name their</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.359" end="00:45:52.000" style="s2">project post-modernism that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.720" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">something that came</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.000" end="00:45:55.520" style="s2">after but then there&#39;s also this sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">the idea of modernism i believe is about</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">conquering territory so the modern</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.400" style="s2">project kind of quite explicitly you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">know as expansionist</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.400" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">and they were gonna use rationality and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:09.680" style="s2">science to do these things</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:11.839" style="s2">then post-modernism was almost about</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.680" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">conquering modernism itself by turning</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.839" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">this very intellectual critique on its</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:16.880" style="s2">language games</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">and pulling it apart and now the meta</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.880" end="00:46:20.640" style="s2">modern seem to think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">if we can just recognize that then we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.640" end="00:46:24.560" style="s2">can conquer it all</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to be all right and</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.560" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">precisely the wrong point to look at you</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">know daniel you said something to me</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">that i felt very deeply the other day</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">which is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">in some deep sense we have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:37.119" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost to techno capital it&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">run and growing up from winning us and</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.920" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of taken us over</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">and so i was writing about this in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">email fred earlier it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird hegelian inversion</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">where just at the point where</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">modern man thought he was going to take</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.440" style="s2">over the world with his machines they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">turned around and consumed him</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.440" end="00:46:59.200" style="s2">and now we&#39;re all in the belly of this</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">and we&#39;re like what the [ __ ] yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">interesting because we were we had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">discussion today on uh about i</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">i i was reading this guy&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">catalastim</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">and his formula was you know modernism</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">post-modernism and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">trans modernism and i jumped on that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">because i thought i thought</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">at least it has the transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">aspect in it where we&#39;re modern</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">where metamodernism seems like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">jacking off to me like</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:28.480" style="s2">if i can be a little bit blunt like uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.480" end="00:47:32.079" style="s2">whereas the transcendental right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">you know like like uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.079" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">tom wrote a book about about will and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:40.400" style="s2">transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">that that has some meat to it uh um</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.400" end="00:47:44.000" style="s2">to me and then and then you were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">you objected a little bit because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.000" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">seemed like okay here&#39;s another prefix</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">or whatever and it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">game and you know that we can play and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">i could see your point as well but um</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">that i see this is that uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:56.960" style="s2">there&#39;s two modes uh to look at it one</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">of them is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.960" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">is that which show one intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">dislikes and which i</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.440" style="s2">understand why he says that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">being against</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.440" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">term coining prematurely uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">and the other one which is which is i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">think the juice of the matter which</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:14.800" style="s2">we&#39;re all actually trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">which is the hardest thing so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.800" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">we try to look to the past and figure</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:19.839" style="s2">out our frame is</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">the actual phallic energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.839" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">establishment of the edifying of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">constructing of the proper way to relate</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:37.520" style="s2">um i have personally like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.280" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">come hmm i lost your voice</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.520" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">is that just me or um</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know if you i kept it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">maybe just rehash the point daniel</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:50.319" style="s2">okay so the point is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.480" style="s2">i i i i want to get to the point that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.319" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">uh domesticated</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.480" end="00:48:57.440" style="s2">right pandora&#39;s box is open uh we live</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.240" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">so we were to uh creating these</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">names that we put onto reality to sort</p>

<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.880" style="s2">at this point in history</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">at the very moment when we finish</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.880" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">perhaps naming the thing that we see</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">and put it out there that is already</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">outdated it&#39;s already over because of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">speech because of acceleration</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">yeah the game is over the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">you put a name on so obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">there&#39;s the other way which is the uh i</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">would call it more of a phallic delisian</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">way of engaging with the flux of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">things become and that&#39;s why i come back</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">to the applied science of domesticating</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">uh ghosts of the behaviorism</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">of um you know belief so so nick land</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:49.839" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">guideboar and so many people speak about</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.839" end="00:49:53.040" style="s2">intelligence having become autonomous as</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:55.359" style="s2">a process so</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.040" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">our ghosts i keep coming back to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.359" end="00:49:59.119" style="s2">idea that in french</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">fantasy or sexual fantasy is called</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.119" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">fantasma i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.800" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">if i&#39;m right on this but i think they</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">they overlapping away and that just</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.839" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s precise why because this surplus</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:09.680" style="s2">libido right that does not fit into the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">old vessels has run amok</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.680" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">capitalism wants to make a buck out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.000" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">that so really incentivizes that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:18.319" style="s2">and so it just runs amok to the point</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">where all these ghosts this army of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.319" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">dead</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:22.079" style="s2">is currently in charge of things we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">i think that within the cacophony of</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.000" end="00:50:28.079" style="s2">chaos the the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:29.839" style="s2">or a worthwhile message that is more</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.079" end="00:50:31.280" style="s2">towards the trend that you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">is necessary andrew</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.280" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">uh something edifying something</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:36.240" style="s2">constructive something more phallic</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">something that is more about like okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.240" end="00:50:39.920" style="s2">how do we</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">do things for me is to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.920" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">proper way to engage</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">is just talk about how to domesticate</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:48.240" style="s2">how to what do you mean by that as you</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:50.559" style="s2">said domesticate</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.240" end="00:50:52.000" style="s2">ghosts and and my mind went blank and i</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t quite sure what you meant by</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:53.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">yeah so what i mean by that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.760" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">know our thoughts appear in our minds uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">uh not out of a void right there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">a context</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a memetic context there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">discursive context</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">uh you know i have a name i use</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:08.000" style="s2">sentences to have a predicate and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">subject that that&#39;s already like a thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.000" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">in itself the power as foucault said is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:12.559" style="s2">something that&#39;s embedded in everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.559" end="00:51:19.599" style="s2">and what capitalism post-modernism did</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">is to basically throw that into</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.599" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">into chaos and technocapitalism is king</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">in doing that and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">let me see if i get this in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">not too too confusing</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:31.040" style="s2">and contrived the spectacle becomes</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:32.559" style="s2">autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.040" end="00:51:34.079" style="s2">all of the ideas that we have are</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.559" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">integrated into this the belly of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.079" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">large machine</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.599" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">and they transcend us they become too</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">large and in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">we are no longer and i we are</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:45.119" style="s2">subservient to this machine we</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:47.040" style="s2">all right the ideas that we have are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.119" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">our own the tastes</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.040" end="00:51:51.280" style="s2">that we have are formed governed by men</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.280" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">largely never heard of this was said by</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">walter lipman in the in the 20s and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">30s this was said by bernays who by the</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:02.839" style="s2">so already there he was intuiting this</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.040" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.839" end="00:52:06.559" style="s2">psychoanalysis was already getting to at</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">the time as well which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.559" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">yeah these ghosts these these will these</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:14.079" style="s2">liberal</p>

<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">enough right</p>

<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">extremely fast and the rate at which</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">they become obsolete</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">is accelerating so that&#39;s why the art of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">building the new vessels for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">is an art of domesticating desire of</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">designing</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">desire itself because right now</p>

<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:57.040" style="s2">they make a bucket of this and</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.280" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">i think that the creative thing to do to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.040" end="00:53:01.280" style="s2">edify is really to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:02.160" style="s2">construct and this construction will not</p>

<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">landscape really settling the new sphere</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s currently at war the war of</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:19.839" style="s2">everyone against everyone that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">dugan calls new machia</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.839" end="00:53:23.040" style="s2">and i think that from that landscape</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.040" end="00:53:28.720" style="s2">you know things happening after this</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">what i like about what you&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.720" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">and you mentioned and</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.200" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">uh magic and and in our preliminary talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.000" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">we even talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:41.839" style="s2">crowley i have a friend who is like a a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">professor in a university in berlin and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.839" end="00:53:47.040" style="s2">he had a order</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">of occult art right and so that was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.040" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">that was an order</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.400" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">for literature basically but they used</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:57.200" style="s2">these old techniques to bring out new</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:54:00.559" style="s2">forms of description of</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.200" end="00:54:02.720" style="s2">of of fantasma you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.559" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">it was not just it was not just poetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.720" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">there was like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">a vivid a living thing being invoked</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.880" style="s2">there and this is like one of these</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">great prerogatives of magic uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.880" end="00:54:16.559" style="s2">still i think that that it can do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.559" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">that it still uh offers the the tools</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:23.359" style="s2">and the techniques to</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">you know crack open the the models of</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.359" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">the world that we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">and you know be confronted by the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">and to create something new in there</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">you know yeah i&#39;ve been studying this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:36.559" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">this form of uh you know hermetic cabela</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.559" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">recently and right the methodology is</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:43.200" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">um because okay you have these cards uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.200" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">and you you you you you you stare at an</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">you know in it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:51.520" style="s2">usually an alchemical image you know of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.000" style="s2">mercury and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.520" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">sulfur and symbolized by the sun and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.000" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">moon and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">you know actually the sun is feminine</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">and the moon is masculine and that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:00.559" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">and that which is i thought kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.559" end="00:55:04.640" style="s2">interesting and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">you look at this card which is a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.640" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">primordial design and you stare at it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">and you allow your mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.799" style="s2">to to um to uh and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">you can use your intellect and an</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.799" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">associative mind to</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">to to to go deeper into this image and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">you study it for several days like nine</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">days</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:23.200" style="s2">um the first part of the meditation is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:25.040" style="s2">you study the these in</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.200" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">this image the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.040" end="00:55:29.200" style="s2">meditation is you visualize the image</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:31.200" style="s2">and you try to keep it the image just</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:33.680" style="s2">the pure visualization of the image</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.200" end="00:55:34.960" style="s2">in silence and and you deepen the just</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.680" end="00:55:36.400" style="s2">the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">part of the image so it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.400" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">embodied right that&#39;s the second stage</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:43.119" style="s2">of the practice and the third stage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">the practice is you dissolve</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.119" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">everything uh and and usually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">sort of a bliss that arises</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:52.720" style="s2">and and and there&#39;s a kind of pure</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">creative spirit right that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.720" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">that comes which can be anything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">sort of in this dissolving stage</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">um and so i thought that that model uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:04.799" style="s2">was was very very interesting in terms</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.799" end="00:56:07.839" style="s2">you know you know how we can we can we</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">can look at alchemy</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.839" end="00:56:12.160" style="s2">and magic because there was nothing</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:15.440" style="s2">particularly like uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">uh i don&#39;t know freak freaky but it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.440" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">all very</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">all very uh straight straight forward on</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:23.200" style="s2">one level at the same time right</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.400" style="s2">all right so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve been made</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.200" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">familiar to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.400" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">this sort of way to relate to memes and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.319" style="s2">symbols because now</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">uh they saturate and permeate every</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.319" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">aspect of our lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">in other words the reason why pentagrams</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:36.720" style="s2">and and little</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.799" style="s2">horus eyes don&#39;t really work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.720" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">today in their magical</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.799" end="00:56:42.240" style="s2">accursed character at least in the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">that we fantasize that use</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.240" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">that they used to in the past is because</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:47.200" style="s2">they&#39;ve become deflated</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">there&#39;s so many other symbols around</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.200" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">them that by sheer virtue of scale</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">like uh they they just don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">same impact in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.640" style="s2">already calloused perception let me just</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">read something to you about</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.640" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">the mad prophet uh nick land who&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">nothing but an occultist talking about</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:06.720" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">said what is concealed the occult</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.720" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">is an alien order of time which betrays</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:12.319" style="s2">itself through coincidences</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:13.359" style="s2">synchronicities and similar indications</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.319" end="00:57:15.839" style="s2">of an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.359" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">arrangements of fate i think this</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.839" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">connects to the cabal</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:22.480" style="s2">deeply an example is the kabbalistic</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:23.359" style="s2">pattern occulted in ordinary languages a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.480" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">cannot emerge without eroding itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.280" style="s2">since the generalized human</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:31.920" style="s2">understanding and the liberated usage</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.280" end="00:57:33.280" style="s2">of letter clusters as numerical units</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.920" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">would shut down the channel of</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:35.440" style="s2">coincidence i know this sounds a little</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.440" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">weird but coincidence</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">also known as alien information so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">only because people use</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">words without numerizing them that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:47.359" style="s2">remain open as conduits for something</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.359" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">to dissolve the screen that hides such</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:53.119" style="s2">things and by hiding them enables them</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:54.640" style="s2">to continue</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.119" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">is diffused with the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.640" end="00:57:59.680" style="s2">signal and liquidate the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">now for me this is this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.680" end="00:58:02.000" style="s2">referring to that process that we were</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">talking to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.000" end="00:58:06.319" style="s2">about andrew of figuring out a</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">relationship to the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.319" end="00:58:09.359" style="s2">what is hidden what is true and this</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.400" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.359" end="00:58:14.240" style="s2">kind of a schizoanalytical or or a very</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.400" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">creative pursuit as well of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.240" end="00:58:16.960" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:18.240" style="s2">where ideas come from how do we relate</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.960" end="00:58:19.559" style="s2">to them how do they react and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.240" end="00:58:22.799" style="s2">symbols have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.559" end="00:58:26.880" style="s2">rediscovered and renewed in</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.799" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">in in a in a view that is is um</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.880" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t know how to say that with with</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:33.520" style="s2">the correct view rather than</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">as as some kind of parlor game or or you</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.520" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.119" style="s2">there has to be some kind of study</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">behind you know you know uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.119" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">what is the ground of of all of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.599" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">symbols that bubble up from it you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:46.160" style="s2">and um rather than them becoming some</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:48.960" style="s2">kind of reified</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.160" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">formulaic kind of you know like very</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.960" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">very easily</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">you know we we have this potential to</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">create all these cults right</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">uh uh we have this very these days which</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:01.599" style="s2">which is is a bit terrifying so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.599" end="00:59:05.359" style="s2">that and and that practice that</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">that we&#39;re just talking about and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.359" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">the danger that is hidden within it</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.119" end="00:59:11.839" style="s2">the madness of actually reinventing the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:13.599" style="s2">whole root of reality for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.839" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">it&#39;s a serious game it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.599" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">game um</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">that&#39;s where master morality comes from</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:20.559" style="s2">from confronting this abyss</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">and coming back to tell the story to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.559" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">everyone else so there&#39;s a few that go</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:26.880" style="s2">that are brave enough to risk uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.440" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">stepping out of this memetic house</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.880" end="00:59:29.119" style="s2">within which we live</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s those who follow those who</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.119" end="00:59:33.040" style="s2">do that&#39;s that&#39;s for me that&#39;s the bard</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.040" end="00:59:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s master morality itself how do do</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:41.920" style="s2">you have specific practices to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:47.760" style="s2">uh go down the abyss and rejuvenate the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.920" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">ideas and memes and narratives</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.760" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">i would say not really i mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:57.440" style="s2">what i try to do i&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">to give myself a real like strong</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.440" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">grounding in yoga and yoga meditation at</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:06.079" style="s2">the moment almost as a preliminary to</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.839" style="s2">anything else and that does uh points</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.079" end="01:00:10.079" style="s2">involve i mean like where this overlaps</p>

<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.680" end="01:06:21.920" style="s2">is it something that you can create is</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">it that kind of performativism or is it</p>

<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a bit of both so look at look</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.480" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">at the best music or the best art it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">always a mad artist right something on</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.760" end="01:06:43.359" style="s2">uh and and that you know the better the</p>

<p begin="01:06:43.359" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">not necessarily but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:47.359" style="s2">relationship there right there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">the other way around which</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.359" end="01:06:50.960" style="s2">is laboratory music fabricated music</p>

<p begin="01:06:50.960" end="01:06:54.000" style="s2">you know justin bieber has zero</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">longevity or</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.000" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">or pop music has zero longevity but</p>

<p begin="01:07:02.000" end="01:07:05.200" style="s2">so i think that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.359" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">different the same thing but on</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.200" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">ends of the same spectrum uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:12.640" style="s2">so yes this could be created q and r</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">could be created perhaps in a laboratory</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.640" end="01:07:14.960" style="s2">a memetic laboratory with creative</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:17.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.960" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">um but i think that there&#39;s a dimension</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.680" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">where you know you actually have to have</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:22.400" style="s2">some real pathos</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a cheap kind of magic though</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.400" end="01:07:26.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t it it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.480" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">it&#39;s uh like we were talking about a</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.960" end="01:07:31.280" style="s2">sacrifice earlier it&#39;s like sacrificing</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:32.160" style="s2">a lamb to get what you want or something</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.280" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.160" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s probably very</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">appealing to some people to to</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:41.520" style="s2">to go that route it&#39;s my mcdonald&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:42.960" style="s2">do you you know how do you fight it how</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.520" end="01:07:45.520" style="s2">do you how do you put</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.960" end="01:07:46.559" style="s2">beams that destroy memes or or or</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.520" end="01:07:49.760" style="s2">something like that like</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.559" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">like uh uh for me the alchemy</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.760" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">alchemical process might be like you you</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">would create you would you would create</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:56.160" style="s2">a meme that would destroy this tendency</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:58.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.160" end="01:08:00.559" style="s2">of of of driving people in saying or</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.799" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">unless you&#39;re an accelerationist i guess</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.559" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">i guess that</p>

<p begin="01:08:08.480" end="01:08:12.319" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um i mean i think what</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.520" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">you&#39;re driving</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.319" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">andrew is this need to inoculate</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:23.600" style="s2">and i think the fact that we exist</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.759" end="01:08:25.440" style="s2">within this media landscape where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.600" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">being bombarded by</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.679" end="01:08:37.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a real like the alchemical</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">practice is to just notice that a that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:08:42.799" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">one can unplug from that and say like</p>

<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:48.560" style="s2">if that is the dynamic of where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:50.239" style="s2">how can we channel it towards something</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.560" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">transcendent as opposed to getting</p>

<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:56.239" style="s2">well i said yeah and this is where i</p>

<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">can yeah i i wanted to ask one thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:06.239" style="s2">you know if you if you talk about these</p>

<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">you know like in in prehistoric or</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.640" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">ancient times</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:17.920" style="s2">it was legitimized through a priest or a</p>

<p begin="01:09:17.920" end="01:09:21.759" style="s2">right so but what you what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.600" end="01:09:25.520" style="s2">talking about this pepper that that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.759" end="01:09:27.120" style="s2">like 20 year olds basically it&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.520" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">of yeah but there there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.120" end="01:09:30.719" style="s2">to legitimization except that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.719" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">right yes because you said it so so</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:38.560" style="s2">true alchemist fabricating those things</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:40.159" style="s2">that because in that case you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.560" end="01:09:41.600" style="s2">it was just chance it was like a quick</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.159" end="01:09:45.279" style="s2">coincidence and so</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.600" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">then it got it i would say the internet</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.279" end="01:09:47.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:49.640" style="s2">is the priest that is blessing it you</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.440" end="01:09:51.359" style="s2">know it&#39;s the 4chan board that put the</p>

<p begin="01:09:51.359" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">right but on some</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.880" end="01:09:59.920" style="s2">shared space it&#39;s like if we were in a</p>

<p begin="01:09:59.920" end="01:10:03.280" style="s2">and all of a sudden ram&#39;s head showed up</p>

<p begin="01:10:04.880" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely why some people talk</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:09.600" style="s2">about the digital flood or the epistemic</p>

<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:37.520" style="s2">what it shows is this this</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.920" end="01:10:38.800" style="s2">is the fact that perhaps there&#39;s no one</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.520" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">actually driving today there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.800" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">actually it shows that children are</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.080" style="s2">driving</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">the whole thing you know babies right</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.080" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">babies are running the show</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.040" end="01:10:53.440" style="s2">dilemma thing on netflix right</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:55.280" style="s2">and all those guys those it guys they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.440" end="01:10:58.159" style="s2">they&#39;re brilliant asperger</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.280" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">kids who are are have really super high</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.159" end="01:11:02.239" style="s2">iqs and no wisdom right</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">so no wonder they created a monster they</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.239" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">have no wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.440" end="01:11:06.800" style="s2">and they have no authority there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:08.320" style="s2">authority there&#39;s no shaman</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.800" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">you know who is who is taking them</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.320" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">through the steps</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2">towards to toward towards towards wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re just uh they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">just completely</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.239" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">um you know making it up as they go</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">along and so so</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:24.320" style="s2">so again when then we have these figures</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:26.320" style="s2">like greta</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.320" end="01:11:29.360" style="s2">you know uh i think that it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.320" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">like a a child&#39;s crusade or something</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.360" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">i i i let me let me refine on that and</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:35.120" style="s2">why i don&#39;t necessarily agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:36.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.120" end="01:11:38.239" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a property of two things</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.400" end="01:11:39.840" style="s2">one of them is the system so now the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.239" end="01:11:41.040" style="s2">system is decentralized whereas before</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.840" end="01:11:42.480" style="s2">the institution was paramiddle and</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.040" end="01:11:43.440" style="s2">there&#39;s someone at the top who has the</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.480" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">power to</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.440" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">say this is how it&#39;s going to be period</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:48.560" style="s2">right and you know the academia and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:50.159" style="s2">schools back in the day</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.560" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">there was like a clear chain of command</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.159" end="01:11:54.640" style="s2">of truth this is this is where truth</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">will flow down the kabbalistic tree of</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.640" end="01:11:58.719" style="s2">life for the societal pyramid</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:11:59.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s it there&#39;s no other</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.719" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.520" end="01:12:02.960" style="s2">whereas today the properties of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:04.159" style="s2">system of the internet of</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.960" end="01:12:06.719" style="s2">technocapitalism</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.159" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">the internet as technology decentralized</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.719" end="01:12:09.920" style="s2">its meaning making and then capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:13.040" style="s2">creating an incentive</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.920" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">being the market for the proliferation</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.040" end="01:12:16.800" style="s2">so the system has those properties in</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:17.679" style="s2">itself which is even more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.800" end="01:12:20.480" style="s2">having the children</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.679" end="01:12:21.520" style="s2">run it um so that&#39;s one thing right</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.480" end="01:12:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s the system</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.520" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2">argument it&#39;s it&#39;s of the system so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.600" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">not the children it&#39;s the algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">that are running it is that sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:29.679" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying or</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">it&#39;s the system being kind of the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.679" end="01:12:33.920" style="s2">vessel</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">for unchained desire being rampant</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.920" end="01:12:37.280" style="s2">this is the spectacle by gita board this</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:39.040" style="s2">is uh the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.280" end="01:12:41.040" style="s2">autonomous collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.040" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">techno capitalism according to nick land</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.040" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">which is collective human libido being</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">unchained</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:48.239" style="s2">from any other vessel becoming</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.080" style="s2">i think andrew you&#39;re right to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.400" end="01:12:53.600" style="s2">children that is precisely the point</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.080" end="01:12:55.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the childish libido that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.600" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">unconstrained that is not learned to</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:13:00.880" style="s2">channel itself towards something higher</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:02.239" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s this weird confluence between</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.880" end="01:13:05.679" style="s2">the the youth culture</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.239" end="01:13:07.360" style="s2">uh yeah hero you know worse you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.679" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">worship that alexander always talks</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.360" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">about</p>

<p begin="01:13:12.560" end="01:13:15.199" style="s2">the all these people being the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.239" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">symbol of</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.199" end="01:13:18.560" style="s2">of something but what it&#39;s sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.880" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">empty kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.560" end="01:13:21.920" style="s2">kind of uh kind of thing there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.920" end="01:13:27.920" style="s2">it&#39;s self-terminating and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:30.400" style="s2">lead to wisdom and transcendence and and</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.920" end="01:13:33.040" style="s2">and you know real beauty and all those</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.400" end="01:13:34.719" style="s2">things right</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.040" end="01:13:36.560" style="s2">what do you think of jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.719" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">then because because he</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.560" end="01:13:43.360" style="s2">he is he still rests on this</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:46.719" style="s2">pyramidal uh structure of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.360" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">of society he is like a professor and he</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.719" end="01:13:51.679" style="s2">he charged the the symbols in a new way</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:54.320" style="s2">you know so and he created</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.679" end="01:13:55.920" style="s2">memes so so it&#39;s like uh it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.320" end="01:13:57.120" style="s2">antitheath what you just said yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.920" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">that&#39;s what i was sort of</p>

<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:02.400" style="s2">that kind of thing even if he was off in</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.960" end="01:14:05.040" style="s2">in certain ways</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.400" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">but but but but i think i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.040" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:09.520" style="s2">the kind of the kind of thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:12.719" style="s2">need yeah</p>

<p begin="01:14:15.760" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:19.760" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly a different way of what</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.159" end="01:14:24.000" style="s2">daniel is describing</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.760" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">because it&#39;s not uh okay</p>

<p begin="01:14:26.480" end="01:14:32.400" style="s2">point to bring up but</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.400" end="01:14:35.280" style="s2">he was became big on the internet he</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.400" end="01:14:36.800" style="s2">is a psychoanal psychologist that talks</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.280" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">about the bible and christianity so</p>

<p begin="01:14:56.239" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">movements is for me a symptom of</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">these dynamics that i described so it</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:04.719" style="s2">was a very decentralized internet age</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:08.239" style="s2">phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.719" end="01:15:10.000" style="s2">that he had it all right and perhaps by</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.239" end="01:15:10.560" style="s2">tapping into that variety of things that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.000" end="01:15:14.400" style="s2">they did</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.560" end="01:15:16.880" style="s2">he damn it he put ahead</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.400" end="01:15:17.520" style="s2">to a lot of desire that was already out</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.880" end="01:15:19.280" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.520" end="01:15:21.600" style="s2">of people looking for meaning and</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.280" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">looking for for a way out an exit for</p>

<p begin="01:15:22.239" end="01:15:26.800" style="s2">uh yeah i think he kind of became the</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.199" end="01:15:29.199" style="s2">archetype that was missing</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.800" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">in the culture and that also destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.199" end="01:15:32.400" style="s2">him in a sense that it was it&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:34.800" style="s2">for one person to bear</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.400" end="01:15:35.600" style="s2">it&#39;s like that has to be distributed</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.800" end="01:15:38.880" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.600" end="01:15:40.880" style="s2">on some levels and he his view of sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:42.880" style="s2">of the sovereign individual</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:45.520" style="s2">kind of conquering and pulling himself</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.880" end="01:15:47.679" style="s2">up by the bootstraps and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.520" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">is is very is great but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.679" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">like the first part of the story</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:55.120" style="s2">it needs to be completed by uh um</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:57.440" style="s2">by a vision that you know where where</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.120" end="01:15:58.400" style="s2">this responsibility is distributed i</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.440" end="01:16:00.480" style="s2">think right</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.400" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">uh you know does that make any sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.480" end="01:16:04.159" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying like it has to be again</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:06.080" style="s2">it does that that makes that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.159" end="01:16:09.199" style="s2">change and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.080" end="01:16:12.239" style="s2">one sort of savior who who is you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.199" end="01:16:14.239" style="s2">you know because then then the he</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.239" end="01:16:15.520" style="s2">develops a kind of a christ complex and</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.239" end="01:16:16.560" style="s2">then you know of course he gets</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.520" end="01:16:20.159" style="s2">crucified</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.560" end="01:16:22.880" style="s2">um absolutely like i think if he</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.159" end="01:16:23.760" style="s2">had developed a community around him and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.880" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">grown it</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:28.320" style="s2">slowly it might have been a very</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.000" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">different story but in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.320" end="01:16:36.080" style="s2">he tapped into this very primal</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">symbolic charge and then distributed it</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.080" end="01:16:39.840" style="s2">entirely in a way that led people to</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:40.400" style="s2">just be there this is the daddy i never</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.840" end="01:16:42.960" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.400" end="01:16:44.800" style="s2">he&#39;s the savior as you said andrew he</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.960" end="01:16:46.400" style="s2">just became this christ figure</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.800" end="01:16:48.080" style="s2">you know you look at the youtube videos</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.400" end="01:16:50.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.080" end="01:16:52.960" style="s2">quite eerily like it was like he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.960" end="01:16:54.000" style="s2">second coming of christ almost like</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.960" end="01:16:56.640" style="s2">peterson&#39;s come</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.000" end="01:16:57.840" style="s2">to save us i mean intriguingly as well</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.640" end="01:16:58.719" style="s2">just based by what we&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.840" end="01:17:00.320" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.719" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">he also has a voice that sounds a bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.320" end="01:17:04.719" style="s2">like a frog for a while</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:06.239" style="s2">right round on the chance sure no i</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.719" end="01:17:06.800" style="s2">think he took a photo with kermit the</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.239" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">frog</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.800" end="01:17:10.080" style="s2">kind of unknowing about this whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:12.400" style="s2">conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.080" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">but that that exploded something off as</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.400" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">well um</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">there&#39;s something else i wanted to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">about him um</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.199" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">no it&#39;s gone from my mind yeah but i</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.920" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.880" end="01:17:32.719" style="s2">you&#39;re on point um</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.960" end="01:17:35.199" style="s2">he got drawn into the political game</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.719" end="01:17:36.640" style="s2">right he got drawn into the old battle</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.199" end="01:17:39.600" style="s2">of left versus right</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.640" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">20th century west versus east you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.600" end="01:17:41.360" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.920" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">you know whatever like yeah there was a</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.360" end="01:17:46.960" style="s2">there was a what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">manikin good or evil</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:51.600" style="s2">sense of mission that he had which which</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:52.960" style="s2">was powerful in a sense but you know i</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.600" end="01:17:55.120" style="s2">don&#39;t know that the taoists say that</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.960" end="01:17:57.840" style="s2">charisma as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.120" end="01:17:59.120" style="s2">sickness or something um i kind of felt</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.840" end="01:18:02.000" style="s2">that about his charisma</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.120" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">and in some kind of way in retrospect</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.000" end="01:18:06.320" style="s2">although although i think he was very he</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:08.000" style="s2">was genuinely very heroic and brave in</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.320" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">what he did and he generally lifted a</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.000" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">lot of people up and and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">so i so so i i don&#39;t want to sound like</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:16.960" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:20.000" style="s2">you know cutting him down</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.960" end="01:18:21.760" style="s2">that&#39;s coming to mind yeah i so</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.000" end="01:18:23.040" style="s2">owen you remember when we talked to mack</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.760" end="01:18:25.040" style="s2">once and he said that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.040" end="01:18:28.320" style="s2">any critique of a contemporary sort of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.040" end="01:18:30.719" style="s2">left suw situation is recuperated as</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.320" end="01:18:32.239" style="s2">white supremacy and recuperation is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.719" end="01:18:34.719" style="s2">term that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.239" end="01:18:35.840" style="s2">uh situation is theory which is the idea</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.719" end="01:18:39.199" style="s2">that you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.840" end="01:18:41.040" style="s2">che guevara you know the revolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.199" end="01:18:43.040" style="s2">even revolutionary causes like the one</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.040" end="01:18:44.159" style="s2">of shagovara eventually gets recuperated</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.040" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">into capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.159" end="01:18:47.360" style="s2">even if it&#39;s by selling t-shirts that</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:51.120" style="s2">says right</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.360" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">every sort of the 60s became uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.120" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">yoga moms in 2020 so</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:58.320" style="s2">perhaps jordan peterson also got</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">recuperated by the by the machine by</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.320" end="01:19:02.719" style="s2">being brought into this</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.239" end="01:19:04.480" style="s2">field of you know capitalism versus</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:08.080" style="s2">communism which is for me</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.480" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">um just just just a distraction from the</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:12.640" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">um perhaps pathetic nature of what he</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.640" end="01:19:15.040" style="s2">was actually tapping into i mean when he</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">when he was</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.040" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">making a million videos on youtube</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:23.360" style="s2">youtube about the bible it being</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">uh it being um</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.360" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">hyperlinked and making videos about</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:27.840" style="s2">christianity that had a million views i</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.840" end="01:19:31.199" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the true energy</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:33.040" style="s2">coming in but that obviously gets</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.199" end="01:19:36.080" style="s2">recuperated</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.040" end="01:19:37.920" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.080" end="01:19:39.520" style="s2">like when you become famous there are</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.920" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">two versions of you</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.520" end="01:19:43.199" style="s2">you know you have you have the red</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:44.640" style="s2">reductive version of you which becomes</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.199" end="01:19:47.679" style="s2">kind of an avatar</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.640" end="01:19:48.400" style="s2">for a certain ideology uh-huh and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.679" end="01:19:50.640" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.400" end="01:19:51.440" style="s2">your substance gets gets lost in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.640" end="01:19:53.360" style="s2">noise and</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.440" end="01:19:54.960" style="s2">and you know a certain amount of people</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.360" end="01:19:56.719" style="s2">are aware of your substance but most</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:06.719" style="s2">your ideological you know because he was</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:08.480" style="s2">his critique</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.719" end="01:20:10.960" style="s2">it was against ideology and then he</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.480" end="01:20:13.520" style="s2">became a sort of ideologue himself</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.960" end="01:20:14.080" style="s2">indoors there was or something about</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.520" end="01:20:16.480" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.080" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">but isn&#39;t that also andrew greek tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.480" end="01:20:19.679" style="s2">that</p>

<p begin="01:20:19.679" end="01:20:22.159" style="s2">up are</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:23.440" style="s2">exactly the same traits that bring us</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.159" end="01:20:25.440" style="s2">down exactly</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.440" end="01:20:27.199" style="s2">um yeah there&#39;s something very tragic</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.440" end="01:20:28.080" style="s2">about it it&#39;s almost like unspeakable or</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.199" end="01:20:29.600" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.080" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">you know like in the sense like he died</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.600" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">or something like he just disappeared</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.880" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:34.639" style="s2">it&#39;s almost hard to speak about him now</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.120" end="01:20:35.679" style="s2">because he&#39;s because what happened it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.639" end="01:20:37.120" style="s2">like somebody somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.679" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">some person who&#39;s still out there is</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.120" end="01:20:41.440" style="s2">like a ghost and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.360" end="01:20:43.199" style="s2">you you talked about haunting so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.440" end="01:20:44.960" style="s2">this we&#39;re living in this time where</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.199" end="01:20:46.639" style="s2">jordan peterson is sort of haunting us</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.960" end="01:20:48.480" style="s2">in some kind of a way because he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.639" end="01:20:50.480" style="s2">not he&#39;s not actually out there</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.480" end="01:20:52.239" style="s2">doing his thing anymore but he&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.480" end="01:20:55.440" style="s2">haunting the landscape</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.239" end="01:20:57.920" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of like a ghost yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:20:59.440" style="s2">no because we we all at some point will</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.920" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">fall out of time</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.440" end="01:21:02.639" style="s2">you know when when the personality</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:04.719" style="s2">traits and that what we learned just</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.639" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit the environment anymore</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.719" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">and then we become we then we become</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:13.040" style="s2">ghosts and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:15.040" style="s2">you know like not active actors anymore</p>

<p begin="01:24:57.920" end="01:25:01.920" style="s2">movement in some sense because</p>
