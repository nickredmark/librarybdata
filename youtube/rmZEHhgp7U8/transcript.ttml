<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.140" style="s2">thank you so much for joining me very</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.040" end="00:00:07.560" style="s2">welcome while we were waiting for you to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.140" end="00:00:10.440" style="s2">enter I was giving my best attempt at a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:11.910" style="s2">little introduction to you and and and</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.440" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">your ideas and your kind of larger</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.910" end="00:00:15.990" style="s2">project at least as far as I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">able to understand you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.990" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">trying to do and the kind of the major</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">aspects of your ideas but as I think I</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">said to you in the email I&#39;ve only come</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">around to your work quite recently you</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">were suggested to me by someone who who</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">watches these streams I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">and reads my blog and stuff as someone</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">that you know he thought you and I would</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">have a lot to talk about and that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">should look into you and I I&#39;m grateful</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.309" style="s2">for this suggestion because I enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">reading a lot of your texts this week</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.309" end="00:00:42.809" style="s2">and yes I&#39;m just excited to talk with</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">you oh but where I was going with that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.809" end="00:00:48.180" style="s2">is that I you know my I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:49.739" style="s2">your project necessarily perfectly well</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.180" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">so maybe one way we could just kick it</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.739" end="00:00:55.949" style="s2">off is do you maybe could you tell us in</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">your own words how do you see like what</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.949" end="00:01:01.079" style="s2">how do you how do you see the the larger</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:02.370" style="s2">from a larger perspective the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.079" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">you&#39;ve been writing under the blog deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.370" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">code for instance and the talking points</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.379" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">that you&#39;ve really been kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">about and talking about in different</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">places how would you describe you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:13.110" style="s2">when you meet someone like on a bus stop</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:16.049" style="s2">or something and they ask you like you</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.110" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">know what aren&#39;t you that guy who writes</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.049" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">that blog deep code what&#39;s that all</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:23.119" style="s2">about you know how do you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:27.840" style="s2">in a kind of high level overview way</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.119" end="00:01:31.130" style="s2">well I guess first the first order is</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.840" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">that I genuinely endeavor to give people</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.130" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">as honest and full a answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.930" style="s2">question is as is possible and so a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:42.150" style="s2">of it depends on who I&#39;m talking to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.930" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">in this case I&#39;m talking to you and by</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.150" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">proxy to some invisible audience that</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">may or may not be also watching this</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:51.329" style="s2">video so in that context I suppose may</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">be the best way to answer it is is in</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.329" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">terms of a narrative which is how did I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">come to find myself choosing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:02:04.790" style="s2">great yeah so the arc basically has I</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:08.850" style="s2">think three major pieces to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.790" end="00:02:14.490" style="s2">developmentally I I think a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.850" end="00:02:20.210" style="s2">standard child of the 80s nerd archetype</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.490" end="00:02:24.720" style="s2">so very low EQ low socialization</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.210" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">introspection introversion on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.720" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">spectrum a little bit maybe yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:33.210" style="s2">depends I&#39;ve had a substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">high-quality help so I think I show up</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.210" end="00:02:39.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot less on the spectrum that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:42.150" style="s2">maybe I used to okay but yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.720" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">and then the natural attraction to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.150" end="00:02:46.320" style="s2">portfolio of nerd stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:47.910" style="s2">available in that timeframe so an avid</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:50.190" style="s2">player of role-playing games an avid</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.910" end="00:02:52.230" style="s2">reader science fiction and fantasy an</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.190" end="00:02:54.360" style="s2">avid player of strategy and board games</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.230" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">and of course a substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.360" end="00:03:00.090" style="s2">time spent on computers originally on</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:01.500" style="s2">you know computers that had tape drives</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.090" end="00:03:02.970" style="s2">and then disk drives and then hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.500" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">drives and then those cool things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.970" end="00:03:06.360" style="s2">could communicate with other computers</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">etc etc right so that&#39;s a one major arc</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.360" end="00:03:14.160" style="s2">and ironically enough much like our</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">current we&#39;ve got nominee for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.160" end="00:03:20.490" style="s2">Supreme Court I was also a quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">unsuccessful in well no I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.490" end="00:03:23.520" style="s2">make that bear law because there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:27.210" style="s2">much noise on that I did not have any</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.520" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">girlfriends or any kind of female</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.210" end="00:03:32.820" style="s2">companionship in any fashion until early</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:35.790" style="s2">in college so which is sort of part of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.820" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">that same archetype this had important</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.790" end="00:03:41.070" style="s2">impacts in terms of socialization in EQ</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">so I kind of maxed out that player class</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.070" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">in terms of being a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:48.390" style="s2">technology entrepreneur I was involved</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:52.530" style="s2">in three successful technology ventures</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.390" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">in the late 90s and early 2000s the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.530" end="00:03:55.590" style="s2">was a company that I was the CEO and</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">founder of called DivX that I took</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.590" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">public in 2006 and in 2007 ish I retired</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:11.750" style="s2">from that entire phase of my life cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:16.260" style="s2">then in 2008 I was in retirement and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.750" end="00:04:20.220" style="s2">sort of allowing myself to play</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.260" end="00:04:21.959" style="s2">so that play consisted of finding out</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.220" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">what the what was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.959" end="00:04:25.410" style="s2">going on in the social field so doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:27.389" style="s2">things like going to Necker Island and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.410" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">hanging out with Richard Branson or</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:32.520" style="s2">going to the Aspen Institute and hanging</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:36.990" style="s2">out with you know whatever Bill Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.520" end="00:04:38.699" style="s2">and going to the Santa Fe Institute and</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.990" end="00:04:41.039" style="s2">hanging out with people like Murayama</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.699" end="00:04:43.259" style="s2">there&#39;s a Nobel president physicist you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.039" end="00:04:44.669" style="s2">know geniuses over there definitely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.259" end="00:04:46.380" style="s2">exactly in fact I&#39;m hoping to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.669" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">go back there again in mid-october</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.380" end="00:04:51.030" style="s2">so immersing myself in that and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:53.190" style="s2">sort of playing in that in that field</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.030" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">which had become available to me because</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.190" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">I suddenly found myself wealthy and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">happened in the context of the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:05.849" style="s2">financial crisis so I happen to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:09.150" style="s2">place where I could just sort of ask</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.849" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">questions and people who should have</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.150" end="00:05:12.139" style="s2">good answers to those questions happen</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:14.099" style="s2">to be sitting next to me at lunch</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.139" end="00:05:16.380" style="s2">like you know Nobel prize-winning</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.099" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">economists and literally the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.380" end="00:05:21.150" style="s2">invented the credit default swap as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.180" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">concept and what I discovered was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.150" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">rather shocking degree of asymmetry</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">between the narrative that was being</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:32.639" style="s2">presented at the public level and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">reality of the people who actually had</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">some degree of insight into what was</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:39.599" style="s2">going on and so I started just following</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:41.880" style="s2">that basic thread you know they</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.599" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">asymmetry between the the commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.880" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">narrative and the people who knew was</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:47.990" style="s2">going on but in you might call a model</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:51.599" style="s2">free or a random walk I just started</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.990" end="00:05:55.139" style="s2">following my curiosity and what I found</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.599" end="00:05:58.380" style="s2">was a really rather surprising degree of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.139" end="00:06:01.130" style="s2">commonality which was people who knew a</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.380" end="00:06:05.900" style="s2">whole lot about some particular subject</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.130" end="00:06:10.590" style="s2">tended to say that the commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.900" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">conventional wisdom was highly unaware</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.590" end="00:06:16.409" style="s2">of the actual risk that was bedded in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:17.940" style="s2">the domain that they had expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.409" end="00:06:19.469" style="s2">they kind of didn&#39;t matter what it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.940" end="00:06:21.659" style="s2">so if they happen to be a person who had</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.469" end="00:06:25.169" style="s2">this is like ten years ago the most</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.659" end="00:06:28.229" style="s2">expertise in the impact of climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.169" end="00:06:30.089" style="s2">change on coral reefs or it happened to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.229" end="00:06:32.310" style="s2">be somebody who had the most expertise</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.089" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">on the fragility of the game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.310" end="00:06:35.370" style="s2">aspects associated with cyber warfare or</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:38.370" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.370" end="00:06:41.550" style="s2">peace everybody who had expertise on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.370" end="00:06:44.550" style="s2">impact of immigration on socio political</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.550" end="00:06:46.949" style="s2">systems or you know fill in the blank</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.550" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">the the the N and this was actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.949" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">rather large I talk to lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:51.810" style="s2">people covering lots of lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2">territory and what I found universally</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.810" end="00:06:56.610" style="s2">was almost everybody was in fact rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.300" end="00:07:00.630" style="s2">panicked when it came to their specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.610" end="00:07:04.500" style="s2">domain of expertise and this this shows</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.630" end="00:07:07.260" style="s2">up is a really interesting order I say</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.500" end="00:07:08.820" style="s2">not inverse has an oblique but similar</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.260" end="00:07:11.100" style="s2">relationship to a concept called Gelman</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.820" end="00:07:13.500" style="s2">aphasia are you familiar with that no no</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.100" end="00:07:15.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a neat concept so murray gell-mann</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.500" end="00:07:17.669" style="s2">it&#39;s his current term and he happens to</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.990" end="00:07:19.289" style="s2">know a lot about certain subjects</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.669" end="00:07:21.570" style="s2">actually a large number but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.289" end="00:07:23.699" style="s2">pick physics as an example and what he</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.570" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">noticed is that he would find himself</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.699" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">reading some piece of popular literature</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:30.120" style="s2">a book most noted most notably a</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.220" style="s2">magazine or newspaper so said the New</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.120" end="00:07:34.020" style="s2">York Times for example and he happens to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.220" end="00:07:36.600" style="s2">flip to a story that happens to be about</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.020" end="00:07:38.130" style="s2">physics and because he happens to be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.600" end="00:07:40.440" style="s2">domain expert he notices that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.130" end="00:07:41.849" style="s2">article is really terrible like it has</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.440" end="00:07:45.410" style="s2">most of its facts wrong in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.849" end="00:07:47.880" style="s2">oftentimes upside down or backwards and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.410" end="00:07:48.330" style="s2">he gets very upset it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.880" end="00:07:49.919" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.330" end="00:07:51.539" style="s2">and then he flips the page to another</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.919" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">article that happens to be outside of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.539" end="00:07:55.530" style="s2">his domain of expertise and he</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:07:57.870" style="s2">immediately forgets that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.530" end="00:07:59.310" style="s2">category of journalism and assumes that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.870" end="00:08:03.210" style="s2">this particular article is of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.310" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">mostly correct so he has an aphasic</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.210" end="00:08:07.349" style="s2">relationship to a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">of the fact that the common story may in</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.349" end="00:08:11.639" style="s2">fact be universally asymmetrically out</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:15.419" style="s2">of alignment with what the domain</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.639" end="00:08:16.530" style="s2">experts happen to know so this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.419" end="00:08:18.780" style="s2">of like the inverse of that but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.530" end="00:08:20.750" style="s2">domain experts are completely aware of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.780" end="00:08:24.090" style="s2">the fact that their particular domain is</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.750" end="00:08:25.020" style="s2">super fragile and heading in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.090" end="00:08:27.479" style="s2">direction of fragility</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.020" end="00:08:28.830" style="s2">but enter into an almost a delusional</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.479" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">relationship with their own area of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.830" end="00:08:34.709" style="s2">expertise by assuming that everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:37.169" style="s2">else is actually okay right right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.709" end="00:08:39.959" style="s2">basically I found myself as being</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.169" end="00:08:43.680" style="s2">somewhat uncommon ly holding an</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.959" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">awareness of the fact that most things</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.680" end="00:08:48.780" style="s2">actually seem to be much higher holding</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:49.350" style="s2">much higher risk than was normally</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.780" end="00:08:51.570" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.350" end="00:08:53.520" style="s2">and as I started adding these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.570" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">together noticing that these risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.520" end="00:09:00.210" style="s2">factors ended up being self reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">as opposed to ameliorating so this that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.210" end="00:09:05.400" style="s2">entered into a recognition that or</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:06.870" style="s2">rather rather building a model and</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.400" end="00:09:08.820" style="s2">attempting to make sense of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.870" end="00:09:11.460" style="s2">on like why is this happening what does</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.820" end="00:09:12.360" style="s2">it mean and because I was in a place</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.460" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">where I could ask people lots of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.360" end="00:09:16.020" style="s2">questions again I started being able to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:21.660" style="s2">get access to very high quality models</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.020" end="00:09:23.820" style="s2">around how culture works how sociology</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.660" end="00:09:25.680" style="s2">actually fits in the context of say</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.820" end="00:09:28.950" style="s2">human psychological development and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.680" end="00:09:30.150" style="s2">began constructing a metal model of and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.950" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">how everything fits together in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.150" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">synthetic integration of the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:37.320" style="s2">disciplines and different to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:38.700" style="s2">of the whole system including the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.320" end="00:09:40.710" style="s2">natural system of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.700" end="00:09:43.830" style="s2">environment the human system the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.710" end="00:09:45.900" style="s2">anthropological system and the anoetic</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.830" end="00:09:47.700" style="s2">cysts in the system that operates the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.900" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">level of human intelligence in</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.700" end="00:09:51.720" style="s2">consciousness and how these systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:54.780" style="s2">actually interoperate and in basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.720" end="00:09:58.440" style="s2">that meta model told me was that things</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.780" end="00:10:04.470" style="s2">were in fact actually rather bad that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.440" end="00:10:08.130" style="s2">the civilization and the world that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.470" end="00:10:10.500" style="s2">are dependent upon are actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.130" end="00:10:11.640" style="s2">extraordinarily fragile and continuing</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.500" end="00:10:13.620" style="s2">to move in the direction of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.640" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">fragility and that this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.620" end="00:10:17.940" style="s2">can actually be model reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:19.950" style="s2">that we have a decent framework it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.940" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">awesome frameworks because you can&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.950" end="00:10:24.060" style="s2">experiments very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:27.570" style="s2">decent frameworks to explain and have</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.060" end="00:10:29.400" style="s2">predictive capacity so then in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.570" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">the third phase this is the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.400" end="00:10:36.390" style="s2">phase I began indifferent to use that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:38.250" style="s2">that model or that set of models in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.390" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">context of what would seem to actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.250" end="00:10:42.420" style="s2">be going on so here we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:45.420" style="s2">around 2011 around the time of occupy</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.420" end="00:10:47.670" style="s2">and the Arab Spring and begin making</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.420" end="00:10:53.070" style="s2">predictions about what future states</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.670" end="00:10:54.780" style="s2">might show up in different contexts and</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.070" end="00:10:57.540" style="s2">making meaning out of what events did</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.780" end="00:11:01.080" style="s2">occur in the context of the models to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.540" end="00:11:03.089" style="s2">refine the models and in the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.080" end="00:11:06.120" style="s2">arc then it is basic</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.089" end="00:11:07.529" style="s2">three major pieces one is what I just</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.120" end="00:11:11.329" style="s2">described so you may not think of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.529" end="00:11:11.329" style="s2">as a making sense of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.050" end="00:11:22.920" style="s2">the second is endeavoring to construct a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.300" end="00:11:25.319" style="s2">way to to endeavor to design a place</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.920" end="00:11:28.709" style="s2">where we could and in principle should</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.319" end="00:11:31.290" style="s2">go so given that where we are seems</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.709" end="00:11:33.660" style="s2">highly unstable what might something</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.290" end="00:11:38.160" style="s2">look like that is in fact not highly</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.660" end="00:11:39.930" style="s2">unstable by the way in in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.160" end="00:11:41.819" style="s2">what we expect the future to look like</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.930" end="00:11:43.410" style="s2">so not just highly not just stable in</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.819" end="00:11:45.420" style="s2">sort of the immediate term but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.410" end="00:11:48.050" style="s2">somehow intrinsically stable in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.420" end="00:11:51.809" style="s2">context of for example exponential</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.050" end="00:11:54.360" style="s2">technology and then the third piece is</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.809" end="00:11:56.009" style="s2">transition what what kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.360" end="00:11:58.860" style="s2">might be put in place to enable us to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.009" end="00:12:00.779" style="s2">move the maximum amount of what we care</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.860" end="00:12:04.769" style="s2">about from where we are to where we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.779" end="00:12:06.839" style="s2">to go and that&#39;s it so that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.769" end="00:12:09.389" style="s2">that&#39;s the story that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.839" end="00:12:11.579" style="s2">compact and useful that&#39;s very useful</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.389" end="00:12:13.019" style="s2">that&#39;s really great yeah for someone</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.579" end="00:12:15.059" style="s2">who&#39;s only come across you quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.019" end="00:12:16.949" style="s2">recently that definitely gives me much</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.059" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">more context and background for thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.949" end="00:12:19.679" style="s2">about ya just who you are and where</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">you&#39;re coming from and how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.679" end="00:12:24.809" style="s2">writing so that I have read how they</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:26.249" style="s2">came to be so that&#39;s really useful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.809" end="00:12:28.470" style="s2">interesting a few things come to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.249" end="00:12:31.559" style="s2">listening to you give that story one is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.470" end="00:12:33.059" style="s2">I&#39;d it makes me think a lot about Nassim</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.559" end="00:12:36.389" style="s2">Taleb are you familiar with him I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.059" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">sure yeah it sounds like a lot of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.389" end="00:12:40.769" style="s2">of consistencies in your stories and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:42.240" style="s2">I&#39;ve always thought he&#39;s really smart</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.769" end="00:12:44.220" style="s2">and really on top of a lot of things so</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.240" end="00:12:46.499" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting just noting that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.220" end="00:12:47.759" style="s2">another thing that I wonder I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.499" end="00:12:49.499" style="s2">was just to kind of jump right in I</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.759" end="00:12:53.069" style="s2">guess with with difficult questions if</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.499" end="00:12:56.490" style="s2">you don&#39;t mind I mean I think a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.069" end="00:12:59.009" style="s2">about the degree to which it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.490" end="00:13:01.499" style="s2">possible anymore for us to should talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.009" end="00:13:02.819" style="s2">with these kinds of steering metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.499" end="00:13:04.889" style="s2">kind of like you were just using you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.819" end="00:13:07.139" style="s2">know we think of we tend to think of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.889" end="00:13:08.579" style="s2">society as this kind of ship and if</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.139" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">we&#39;re smart and we figure out how it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.579" end="00:13:12.269" style="s2">works and we can kind of communicate to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:14.730" style="s2">each other different proposals and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.269" end="00:13:16.589" style="s2">try to kind of steer the ship based on</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:16.920" style="s2">on these proposals to get us from one</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.589" end="00:13:19.760" style="s2">state</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.920" end="00:13:22.500" style="s2">to another and I want I just wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.760" end="00:13:26.040" style="s2">that precisely what&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.500" end="00:13:29.550" style="s2">in some sense global techno capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.040" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">has be is be is becoming so complex and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.550" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">so fast</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">if the runaway process is so great that</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:37.380" style="s2">a kind of you know non-human super</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:40.980" style="s2">intelligence in the form of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.380" end="00:13:44.519" style="s2">global markets is basically now escaped</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.980" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">our control to the degree that the even</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.519" end="00:13:48.120" style="s2">using the kinds of implicit metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:50.220" style="s2">that you were using about like how we</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.120" end="00:13:53.010" style="s2">can kind of steer humanity from one one</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.220" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">state to another you know I I&#39;m not at</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.010" end="00:13:56.839" style="s2">all convinced that that&#39;s not possible</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:59.459" style="s2">but I have to admit I&#39;m I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.839" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">concerned and about that about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.459" end="00:14:04.470" style="s2">possibility that perhaps that entire way</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:06.839" style="s2">of thinking is is just no longer</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.470" end="00:14:08.070" style="s2">something that we have access to like</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.839" end="00:14:09.750" style="s2">there we are not steering the ship</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.070" end="00:14:11.940" style="s2">anymore in other words and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.750" end="00:14:14.550" style="s2">we are now predominantly being steered</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.940" end="00:14:16.709" style="s2">by non-human intelligence forces that</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.550" end="00:14:18.839" style="s2">are over and above our heads and quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.709" end="00:14:20.310" style="s2">beyond our control I I wonder if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.839" end="00:14:24.930" style="s2">you know what you think about that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.310" end="00:14:28.350" style="s2">think that&#39;s an accurate assessment this</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.930" end="00:14:31.529" style="s2">is my so let me put it in some context</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.350" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">sure what I heard you say and I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.529" end="00:14:34.140" style="s2">it&#39;s probably also important to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:35.880" style="s2">sure we stay somewhat in sync since</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.140" end="00:14:37.380" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;ve just met and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.880" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">about rather complicated things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.380" end="00:14:46.040" style="s2">that&#39;s true great what I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:50.850" style="s2">was first something on the lines of some</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.040" end="00:14:54.750" style="s2">question about how it is that groups of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:14:59.180" style="s2">humans are able to collaborate in making</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.750" end="00:15:02.600" style="s2">effective choices in the world second</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.180" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">that there is some relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.600" end="00:15:10.410" style="s2">how it first comes to being and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:12.779" style="s2">context that it finds itself in third</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.410" end="00:15:18.569" style="s2">that the context that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.779" end="00:15:23.610" style="s2">in is substantially more either</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.569" end="00:15:27.720" style="s2">turbulent or daunting or itself agenting</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.610" end="00:15:29.730" style="s2">then the how that we have in Category in</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.720" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">number one and therefore we find</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.730" end="00:15:33.269" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:36.209" style="s2">no longer able to have effective agency</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.269" end="00:15:40.829" style="s2">is that a fair Restatement sure that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.209" end="00:15:47.339" style="s2">works yeah okay so I completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.829" end="00:15:51.119" style="s2">however let me then share how I respond</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.339" end="00:15:55.339" style="s2">to that second the first is to take a</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.119" end="00:15:55.339" style="s2">look at in the context of category one</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.300" end="00:16:02.579" style="s2">what what might be the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.339" end="00:16:05.209" style="s2">conditions on how much collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.579" end="00:16:09.449" style="s2">intelligence we could actually aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.209" end="00:16:15.209" style="s2">under different configurations as it</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.449" end="00:16:17.999" style="s2">were second in category two is there any</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.209" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">way of having a sense of whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.999" end="00:16:21.929" style="s2">dealing with a practical problem or a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:24.749" style="s2">principled problem and a practical</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.929" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">problem is I can&#39;t if I can only lift a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.749" end="00:16:27.949" style="s2">hundred pounds I&#39;m doing with the two</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:31.369" style="s2">hundred pound weight I can&#39;t lift it a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.949" end="00:16:33.809" style="s2">principal problem is I can&#39;t lift myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.369" end="00:16:36.029" style="s2">all right that&#39;s there&#39;s problems that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.809" end="00:16:38.519" style="s2">are insoluble in principle and problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.029" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">that are insoluble in practice right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.519" end="00:16:45.329" style="s2">then the third is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:47.220" style="s2">characteristics of the problem that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.329" end="00:16:48.809" style="s2">that we have to deal with you know are</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.220" end="00:16:53.639" style="s2">we dealing with something where there is</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.809" end="00:16:55.559" style="s2">a for example a large state complexity</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.639" end="00:16:56.759" style="s2">are we dealing with something there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.559" end="00:16:59.610" style="s2">large state of complexity also has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.759" end="00:17:00.990" style="s2">large rate of growth are we doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.610" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">something as a large state of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.990" end="00:17:05.610" style="s2">a large rate of growth and has an</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:08.939" style="s2">adaptive relationship with category one</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.610" end="00:17:12.539" style="s2">whereby the more capable we become the</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.939" end="00:17:16.620" style="s2">more capable it becomes etc you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.539" end="00:17:19.289" style="s2">what are the characteristics now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.620" end="00:17:20.520" style="s2">this level of thinking and by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.289" end="00:17:24.059" style="s2">should mention I&#39;m going to use the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.520" end="00:17:28.500" style="s2">I here where in fact the the deep code</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.059" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">project is a collaboration but many of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.500" end="00:17:32.429" style="s2">the folks in the collaboration choose to</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:34.169" style="s2">remain anonymous and so I&#39;ll just sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.429" end="00:17:36.299" style="s2">of take responsibility and a good rule</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.169" end="00:17:38.970" style="s2">of thumb is to the degree to which it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.299" end="00:17:40.409" style="s2">appears to be good stuff that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.970" end="00:17:41.970" style="s2">out of deep code you can assume that</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.409" end="00:17:44.309" style="s2">somebody else did it and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.970" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">which it&#39;s poorly done you can assume in</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.309" end="00:17:51.220" style="s2">blame</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:53.110" style="s2">I appreciate your modesty and then when</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.220" end="00:17:54.130" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing me speak directly you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.110" end="00:18:00.970" style="s2">take that for what it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.130" end="00:18:02.440" style="s2">sure okay so category one this is where</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.970" end="00:18:05.290" style="s2">I began the process of doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.440" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">for example considering the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.290" end="00:18:08.530" style="s2">I don&#39;t if you spend any time take a</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:11.710" style="s2">look at that but that was an effort to</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.530" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">take a look at the collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.710" end="00:18:15.490" style="s2">intelligence coordinating mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:20.200" style="s2">that had achieved the highest level of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.490" end="00:18:23.020" style="s2">actual efficacy in in history which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.200" end="00:18:25.450" style="s2">sort of where we are right now now that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.020" end="00:18:27.310" style="s2">that analysis has basically two pieces</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.450" end="00:18:28.960" style="s2">to it you know I guess three one is</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.310" end="00:18:30.850" style="s2">aesthetic here&#39;s what it looks like and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">feels like but the most important parts</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.850" end="00:18:37.170" style="s2">are what its limits are it actually has</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.940" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">boundary conditions and so it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.170" end="00:18:42.280" style="s2">not capable is let&#39;s say for example it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.180" style="s2">can only be a hundred pounds and so if</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.280" end="00:18:44.860" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a problem which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.180" end="00:18:48.070" style="s2">about 100 pounds it&#39;s not the right tool</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.860" end="00:18:52.090" style="s2">and then secondarily in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.070" end="00:18:52.870" style="s2">historical location now for many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.090" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">that we can drill into if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.870" end="00:18:58.090" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s also in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:59.470" style="s2">a rate downward which is that the blue</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.090" end="00:19:01.930" style="s2">church as an effective collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.470" end="00:19:05.470" style="s2">intelligence is decreasing in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.930" end="00:19:06.430" style="s2">effectiveness so at its best it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.470" end="00:19:07.900" style="s2">deal with the problems we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.430" end="00:19:10.930" style="s2">with and it&#39;s also not at its best in</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.900" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">fact it&#39;s kind of in our way so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.930" end="00:19:16.690" style="s2">one one piece the another piece is then</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:19.000" style="s2">endeavoring at this is what the concept</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.690" end="00:19:23.770" style="s2">is called deep code going to the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.000" end="00:19:26.620" style="s2">principles that that we could find what</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.770" end="00:19:27.700" style="s2">might be the is there any reason to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.620" end="00:19:29.350" style="s2">believe that there are in fact limits</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.700" end="00:19:32.470" style="s2">that the blue church is for example the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.350" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">best or are there different ways of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.470" end="00:19:37.240" style="s2">designing collective intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:41.320" style="s2">can give rise to something which is say</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.240" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">substantially better and I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.320" end="00:19:45.220" style="s2">the word better here sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">metaphorically just gooder than the blue</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.220" end="00:19:49.660" style="s2">church and while we&#39;re at it since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:51.790" style="s2">not really useful to design something</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.660" end="00:19:52.840" style="s2">which is good but not good enough is</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.790" end="00:19:54.190" style="s2">there any reason to believe that in</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.840" end="00:19:57.010" style="s2">principle it could be quote unquote good</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.190" end="00:19:58.630" style="s2">enough to address the problematic that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.010" end="00:20:00.940" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.630" end="00:20:02.290" style="s2">and then secondarily this has actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.940" end="00:20:05.020" style="s2">never been published but also taking a</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.290" end="00:20:06.250" style="s2">look at the problem domain you give it a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.020" end="00:20:07.870" style="s2">term what was it called late stage</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.250" end="00:20:10.030" style="s2">capitalism or techno capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.870" end="00:20:12.190" style="s2">something like that oh I I was just I</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.030" end="00:20:13.930" style="s2">think colloquially calling it yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.190" end="00:20:17.080" style="s2">can have like global techno capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.930" end="00:20:18.280" style="s2">or whatever you want really yeah so that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.080" end="00:20:22.180" style="s2">was an area and by the way there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.280" end="00:20:26.500" style="s2">even other aspects by the way so in</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.180" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">terms of the metamodel you have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.500" end="00:20:29.920" style="s2">base complexity which is it turns out is</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.420" style="s2">a big enough problem that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.920" end="00:20:33.750" style="s2">that the blue church couldn&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.420" end="00:20:35.890" style="s2">that so just like the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.750" end="00:20:37.560" style="s2">humanity&#39;s relationship with the natural</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.890" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">environment all by itself is actually</p>

<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:46.990" style="s2">discovered that in the 70s then you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.690" end="00:20:49.390" style="s2">the magenta capacity the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.990" end="00:20:50.770" style="s2">itself which is kind of like that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.390" end="00:20:53.790" style="s2">problem of trying to swim out into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.770" end="00:20:57.340" style="s2">ocean to a drowning person mmm that as</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.790" end="00:20:59.290" style="s2">it is flailing about endeavoring to be a</p>

<p begin="00:20:59.290" end="00:21:02.410" style="s2">fashion it could take you down with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.450" end="00:21:06.490" style="s2">so you have to sort of address that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.410" end="00:21:08.800" style="s2">problem then you have the agenting</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.490" end="00:21:12.730" style="s2">capacity of functional collective</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.800" end="00:21:14.470" style="s2">intelligences that are orbiting around</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.730" end="00:21:18.130" style="s2">but not part of the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.470" end="00:21:25.210" style="s2">construct this includes for example say</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.130" end="00:21:26.560" style="s2">Google or the NSA these are collective</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.210" end="00:21:28.570" style="s2">intelligence structures that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.560" end="00:21:30.010" style="s2">relatively functional institutions and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.570" end="00:21:32.050" style="s2">therefore operating at a much higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.010" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">level than the blue church were at large</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.050" end="00:21:36.760" style="s2">which of course is operating it now a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:39.640" style="s2">relatively low level I&#39;ve used the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.760" end="00:21:42.430" style="s2">phrase the characteristic of sort of a a</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.220" end="00:21:51.880" style="s2">enough to let them land a punch they can</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.750" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">still knock you out but if you just sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.880" end="00:21:53.920" style="s2">of play a little bit of rope-a-dope</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:56.920" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna collapse with their own</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.920" end="00:21:57.940" style="s2">volition you think that&#39;s weird them you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.920" end="00:22:00.730" style="s2">think that&#39;s where the blue church is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.940" end="00:22:02.680" style="s2">right now oh yes I&#39;m reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.730" end="00:22:05.020" style="s2">confident my confidence on that is say</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.680" end="00:22:07.690" style="s2">above 85% I like that metaphor I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.020" end="00:22:09.160" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense yeah and if</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.690" end="00:22:11.850" style="s2">you use that to sort of watch what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.160" end="00:22:15.350" style="s2">happening in the anglo-american sphere</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.850" end="00:22:17.640" style="s2">I think you&#39;ll find that it predicts</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.350" end="00:22:20.430" style="s2">circumstances pretty effectively right</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.640" end="00:22:22.980" style="s2">okay but then you&#39;ve got again these</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.430" end="00:22:25.650" style="s2">sort of these splinter collective</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.980" end="00:22:28.770" style="s2">intelligences that have much higher</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.650" end="00:22:32.070" style="s2">attracting capacity and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.770" end="00:22:34.110" style="s2">the the collective intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.070" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">I&#39;ve called Leviathan I think Brett</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">or emergent Goliath which is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.560" end="00:22:41.910" style="s2">talking about which is a sort of global</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:45.480" style="s2">scale techno capitalism that runs almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.910" end="00:22:48.800" style="s2">like an ant hive or a hive mind under a</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:58.710" style="s2">since making a choice making and</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.350" end="00:23:01.170" style="s2">delivering on agency we can drill down</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.710" end="00:23:03.150" style="s2">any way you like but the good news is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.170" end="00:23:06.510" style="s2">seems quite likely that we can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.150" end="00:23:08.940" style="s2">develop a substantially more effective</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.510" end="00:23:10.980" style="s2">collective intelligence orders of</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.980" end="00:23:15.780" style="s2">magnitude more than the blue church that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.980" end="00:23:19.700" style="s2">this is more than adequate to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.780" end="00:23:24.830" style="s2">the problem of physical complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.700" end="00:23:30.990" style="s2">anthro complexity radically outcompetes</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.830" end="00:23:32.010" style="s2">Leviathan however may not be adequate to</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.010" end="00:23:37.460" style="s2">complexity right okay so maybe we can do</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.910" end="00:23:39.270" style="s2">a little bit more syncing up of</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.460" end="00:23:41.130" style="s2">vocabularies but I thought that was all</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.270" end="00:23:42.450" style="s2">really interesting and we should we</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.130" end="00:23:44.310" style="s2">should continue to drill down on that</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.450" end="00:23:45.750" style="s2">but I&#39;m thinking I was it&#39;s occurring to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.310" end="00:23:47.640" style="s2">me now maybe I was a little bit rude in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.750" end="00:23:49.350" style="s2">not giving you a little short spiel</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.640" end="00:23:51.300" style="s2">about myself because you have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.350" end="00:23:53.310" style="s2">what you&#39;ve stepped into and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.300" end="00:23:54.330" style="s2">listening and who I am even so without</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.310" end="00:23:57.180" style="s2">much thought about my existential</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.330" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">English that I expected it would be it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.180" end="00:24:01.590" style="s2">less what English what&#39;s up let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.270" style="s2">British the only information I have from</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.590" end="00:24:04.590" style="s2">you is associated with the UK oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.270" end="00:24:06.150" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah so you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.590" end="00:24:08.310" style="s2">confused and disoriented so I should</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.150" end="00:24:11.490" style="s2">tell you I yeah I&#39;m an American I moved</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.310" end="00:24:12.750" style="s2">here for I&#39;m a professor here so I moved</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.490" end="00:24:15.810" style="s2">here for an academic job and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.750" end="00:24:17.850" style="s2">here for like five years but so yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.810" end="00:24:20.730" style="s2">like a by profession I&#39;m a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.850" end="00:24:23.420" style="s2">traditional political scientist I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.730" end="00:24:25.240" style="s2">mostly quantitative statistical research</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.420" end="00:24:27.040" style="s2">but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.240" end="00:24:28.710" style="s2">long been interested in questions of</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.040" end="00:24:31.150" style="s2">political theory and basically I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.710" end="00:24:32.140" style="s2">without going on about my whole story I</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.150" end="00:24:34.600" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.140" end="00:24:37.720" style="s2">I basically just academia is not what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.600" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">hoped it would be and I&#39;m just really</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.720" end="00:24:42.100" style="s2">bored basically and I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:44.590" style="s2">something I&#39;m you know I&#39;m looking for</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.100" end="00:24:46.540" style="s2">something much much better than what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.590" end="00:24:47.860" style="s2">can make an offer so I basically just</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.540" end="00:24:49.930" style="s2">turned to the Internet and I&#39;m just kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.860" end="00:24:51.540" style="s2">of going wild like blogging and having</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.930" end="00:24:55.450" style="s2">these conversations with whoever I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.540" end="00:24:58.300" style="s2">trick on meeting me in the chat rooms so</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.450" end="00:25:00.460" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t an example of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.300" end="00:25:02.260" style="s2">we were just having what&#39;s the what do</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.460" end="00:25:03.970" style="s2">you mean well you you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.260" end="00:25:05.670" style="s2">identified that one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.970" end="00:25:09.070" style="s2">organs of sense picking the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.670" end="00:25:10.870" style="s2">academia right is so inadequate that</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.070" end="00:25:12.190" style="s2">even though you are relatively present</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.870" end="00:25:13.750" style="s2">within the center of it you are</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.190" end="00:25:15.550" style="s2">nonetheless choosing to spend your time</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.750" end="00:25:18.730" style="s2">in an emergent collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.550" end="00:25:20.590" style="s2">ie the internet doesn&#39;t and one might</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.730" end="00:25:24.010" style="s2">say there are particular reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.590" end="00:25:26.530" style="s2">that makes sense to you yes for sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.010" end="00:25:30.010" style="s2">yeah exactly so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.530" end="00:25:32.590" style="s2">where I&#39;m at and so I should tell you a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.010" end="00:25:34.870" style="s2">little bit also about my the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.590" end="00:25:38.860" style="s2">milieu in which I do my blogging and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.870" end="00:25:42.220" style="s2">these live streams and how should I put</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.860" end="00:25:44.140" style="s2">this we it&#39;s often I&#39;m often kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.220" end="00:25:47.230" style="s2">called or lumped in with people known as</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.140" end="00:25:48.940" style="s2">kind of acceleration is though I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.230" end="00:25:50.890" style="s2">you a little bit about though just kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.940" end="00:25:52.030" style="s2">of very broadly how I&#39;m inclined to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.890" end="00:25:53.080" style="s2">things and this will probably make a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.030" end="00:25:55.150" style="s2">little bit more sense out of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.080" end="00:25:56.980" style="s2">question that I originally posed you and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.150" end="00:25:58.420" style="s2">so the way that I tend to see it with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.980" end="00:26:02.800" style="s2">lot of the people who I write with and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.420" end="00:26:04.270" style="s2">talk with is that basically modernity</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.800" end="00:26:06.160" style="s2">was was a real turning point and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.270" end="00:26:08.040" style="s2">specifically what happens at the turning</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.160" end="00:26:15.010" style="s2">point of modernity is that capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.040" end="00:26:17.500" style="s2">kind of this superhuman or you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.010" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">extra human force that kind of gets out</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.500" end="00:26:21.670" style="s2">of the bag basically so you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:24.760" style="s2">most of pre modernity as this attempt by</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.670" end="00:26:28.380" style="s2">humans to kind of contain or to lock</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.760" end="00:26:31.090" style="s2">down the explosive and and quite brutal</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.380" end="00:26:32.620" style="s2">implications of intelligence itself you</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.090" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">know the production of intelligence you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.620" end="00:26:38.260" style="s2">know most like a lot of you know early</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:38.919" style="s2">pre-modern religious teachings so can</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.260" end="00:26:40.299" style="s2">can be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.919" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">interpreted as you know be careful what</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.299" end="00:26:44.470" style="s2">you do with intelligence because if you</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:46.929" style="s2">let the if you let it out of the bag too</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.470" end="00:26:49.149" style="s2">recklessly you know you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.929" end="00:26:50.739" style="s2">gonna regret it and so we tend to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.149" end="00:26:52.619" style="s2">modernity as kind of the point at which</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.739" end="00:26:55.269" style="s2">well that kind of happened and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.619" end="00:26:58.330" style="s2">intelligence was escaped it escaped its</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.269" end="00:27:00.789" style="s2">box and and initiated this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.330" end="00:27:02.859" style="s2">recursive explosive process that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.789" end="00:27:04.989" style="s2">know we we begins with you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.859" end="00:27:06.850" style="s2">industrialization and we&#39;re now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.989" end="00:27:09.340" style="s2">continuing to live through especially</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.850" end="00:27:11.619" style="s2">with you know the approach of you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.340" end="00:27:15.659" style="s2">self-improving artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.619" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">and all of this so in that in that light</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.659" end="00:27:20.440" style="s2">myself and a lot of people I talk with</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">are inclined to see the increasing</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.440" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">social complexity that you talk about as</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">this kind of yeah this kind of loosely</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">organized super intelligence this kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:39.629" style="s2">of in human or non-human super</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:42.609" style="s2">intelligence that is basically now now</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.629" end="00:27:44.169" style="s2">so great or it operates at such a high</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.609" end="00:27:45.879" style="s2">level of it&#39;s able to integrate so much</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.169" end="00:27:49.720" style="s2">more information than any of us are as</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.879" end="00:27:51.309" style="s2">mere you know biological entities that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.720" end="00:27:52.989" style="s2">basically it has its own purposes that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.309" end="00:27:54.850" style="s2">capitalism has its own purposes which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.989" end="00:27:57.609" style="s2">the abstract increase of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.850" end="00:28:00.629" style="s2">itself and and what majority looks like</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.609" end="00:28:02.830" style="s2">is this this abstract process in which</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.629" end="00:28:03.850" style="s2">intelligence is increasing itself and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.830" end="00:28:06.580" style="s2">anything that gets in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.850" end="00:28:08.830" style="s2">intelligence increasing itself basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.580" end="00:28:10.269" style="s2">gets will just be destroyed and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.830" end="00:28:16.090" style="s2">and kind of killed off as as as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.269" end="00:28:18.100" style="s2">deadweight and so in that view a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.090" end="00:28:21.369" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying still I mean what you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.100" end="00:28:24.369" style="s2">just said was very compelling but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.369" end="00:28:25.779" style="s2">hard for me too it&#39;s hard so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.369" end="00:28:30.789" style="s2">inclined to see like a lot of the blue</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.779" end="00:28:33.759" style="s2">church stuff as basically quite meek</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.789" end="00:28:36.070" style="s2">attempts of human beings to basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.759" end="00:28:38.769" style="s2">kind of pull people&#39;s heartstrings and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.070" end="00:28:42.190" style="s2">push the buttons of of you know moral</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.769" end="00:28:44.789" style="s2">intuitions to basically hang on as long</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.190" end="00:28:47.409" style="s2">as they can in a kind of increasing</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.789" end="00:28:49.059" style="s2">intelligence scenario where you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.409" end="00:28:51.090" style="s2">they&#39;re increasingly obsolete so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.059" end="00:28:52.310" style="s2">like this disingenuous game to basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.090" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.310" end="00:28:57.470" style="s2">and resources they can in kind of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:29:00.350" style="s2">their last gasping breaths of you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.470" end="00:29:02.180" style="s2">their agency being being kind of taken</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.350" end="00:29:04.490" style="s2">over so that&#39;s just a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.180" end="00:29:06.170" style="s2">my my kind of the larger perspective</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.490" end="00:29:08.240" style="s2">that I&#39;m bringing to the table I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.170" end="00:29:10.370" style="s2">necessarily wedded to that just giving</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.240" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">you giving you that as background so let</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.370" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">me test some yeses quite some questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.790" end="00:29:23.240" style="s2">does your ontology it sounded to me and</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.040" end="00:29:24.260" style="s2">I think this is probably wrong but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.240" end="00:29:27.640" style="s2">sounded to me like your ontology</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.260" end="00:29:32.090" style="s2">consists of two ontological objects</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.640" end="00:29:35.540" style="s2">biological human beings and a single</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.090" end="00:29:38.330" style="s2">kind of super intelligence known as</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.540" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">techno capitalism is that an accurate</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.330" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">statement no I don&#39;t think I see what</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:47.930" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking I could I could probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:49.820" style="s2">clarify better in saying that it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.930" end="00:29:54.680" style="s2">like there is abstract intelligence as</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.820" end="00:29:56.960" style="s2">this kind of alien alien seed at the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.680" end="00:29:59.650" style="s2">beginning of of the universe or</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.960" end="00:30:03.640" style="s2">something like that which then you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.650" end="00:30:05.810" style="s2">manifests itself in this in this long</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.640" end="00:30:08.750" style="s2">developmental process in which</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.810" end="00:30:11.020" style="s2">biological humans are one phase of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.750" end="00:30:13.400" style="s2">and then biological humans who create</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.020" end="00:30:16.160" style="s2">capitalism are kind of higher phase of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.400" end="00:30:17.950" style="s2">it but really this is one process this</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.160" end="00:30:21.290" style="s2">is one long process of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.950" end="00:30:23.540" style="s2">basically increasing itself is what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.290" end="00:30:25.880" style="s2">what it looks like and so there prefer</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.540" end="00:30:28.340" style="s2">like part of human history we could get</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.880" end="00:30:30.740" style="s2">away with the with the framework that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.340" end="00:30:33.170" style="s2">were in control you know so long as</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.740" end="00:30:35.450" style="s2">intelligence so long as collective</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.170" end="00:30:37.430" style="s2">intelligence was relatively constrained</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.450" end="00:30:39.950" style="s2">beneath a certain threshold you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.430" end="00:30:42.020" style="s2">these this language that we are so</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.950" end="00:30:44.390" style="s2">inclined to use where you know we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.020" end="00:30:45.920" style="s2">looking at the at the territory and we</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.390" end="00:30:47.450" style="s2">are making these maps and we are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.920" end="00:30:50.450" style="s2">making plans from from point A to point</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.450" end="00:30:53.870" style="s2">B in how we want to guide our future</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.450" end="00:30:56.030" style="s2">that kind of worked for a little while</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.870" end="00:31:00.770" style="s2">so long as the forces were relatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.030" end="00:31:04.250" style="s2">weak but once once abstract in</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.770" end="00:31:06.910" style="s2">intelligence gets out of our box then</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.250" end="00:31:06.910" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:13.309" style="s2">something else something else is is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.670" end="00:31:15.860" style="s2">emerging that&#39;s that&#39;s beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.309" end="00:31:19.549" style="s2">biological containers but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.860" end="00:31:21.650" style="s2">necessarily I&#39;m not necessarily drawing</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.549" end="00:31:23.809" style="s2">like a really important hard distinction</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.650" end="00:31:25.040" style="s2">between our biological containers and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.809" end="00:31:28.280" style="s2">and whatever that is I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.040" end="00:31:29.090" style="s2">that&#39;s useful distinction or not um okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.280" end="00:31:31.610" style="s2">so let me see if I can try a few</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.090" end="00:31:38.660" style="s2">different things one is I&#39;m noticing</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.610" end="00:31:42.980" style="s2">that I don&#39;t have any sense of there</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.660" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">being a point where there was a a real</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.980" end="00:31:48.770" style="s2">notion that individual biologically</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:53.870" style="s2">individual human beings had any strong</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.770" end="00:31:57.490" style="s2">sense of high order autonomy an outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.870" end="00:32:01.340" style="s2">of some kind of larger context so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.490" end="00:32:03.020" style="s2">whether it is the sense of real</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.340" end="00:32:07.510" style="s2">significant low order autonomy say for</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.020" end="00:32:09.650" style="s2">example the during high christendom</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.510" end="00:32:12.500" style="s2">where there is a sense of there being a</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.650" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">divine plan that was just what it was or</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.500" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">whether it&#39;s simply the real recognition</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:18.650" style="s2">that say for example your family has</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.850" end="00:32:22.280" style="s2">significant influence over what you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.650" end="00:32:23.929" style="s2">in life and it is larger than you and of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.280" end="00:32:26.660" style="s2">course beyond your family many many</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.929" end="00:32:28.669" style="s2">other kinds of nested end non nested</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.660" end="00:32:31.580" style="s2">forms of things that are larger than you</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.669" end="00:32:35.510" style="s2">that impose upon your particular agency</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.580" end="00:32:38.330" style="s2">I would imagine that it is a rare human</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.510" end="00:32:41.210" style="s2">a handful who have ever had any real</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.330" end="00:32:43.549" style="s2">sense of any meaningful degree of actual</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.210" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">agency in the world that was larger than</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.549" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">the context in which they found</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:48.890" style="s2">themselves and I would say that most</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:54.260" style="s2">them were probably psychotic manic visit</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.890" end="00:32:56.179" style="s2">but I&#39;m here okay so let&#39;s see we can go</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.260" end="00:32:58.340" style="s2">to a deeper level so then I would said</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.179" end="00:33:02.600" style="s2">that the ontology that I&#39;m working with</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.340" end="00:33:05.350" style="s2">is a one that is actually III largely</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:08.440" style="s2">accept the basic premise that there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.350" end="00:33:12.230" style="s2">the this this notion of intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.440" end="00:33:13.580" style="s2">real I think we&#39;ll discover that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.230" end="00:33:17.780" style="s2">have some very interesting conversations</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.580" end="00:33:19.300" style="s2">about what it is and that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.780" end="00:33:23.530" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.300" end="00:33:25.000" style="s2">this thing intelligence are well quite</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.530" end="00:33:26.770" style="s2">specifically these this is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.000" end="00:33:29.260" style="s2">that gives rise to curves that are super</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.770" end="00:33:30.970" style="s2">linear and therefore it is sort of only</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.260" end="00:33:32.920" style="s2">a matter of time before those</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.970" end="00:33:34.300" style="s2">characteristics take over from linear</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.920" end="00:33:36.490" style="s2">and sub linear characteristics and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.300" end="00:33:39.220" style="s2">become the primary drivers in any kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.490" end="00:33:41.170" style="s2">of system that has intelligence that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.220" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2">way of saying larger what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.170" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">yeah I got from however the specific</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:53.710" style="s2">system design to use that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:33:56.740" style="s2">language they gives rise to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.710" end="00:33:59.220" style="s2">level of intelligence I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.740" end="00:34:02.260" style="s2">area that I have the most inquiry into</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.220" end="00:34:03.880" style="s2">that my proposition is that the system</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.260" end="00:34:05.590" style="s2">does that so I would outset the blue</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.880" end="00:34:08.020" style="s2">church is a particular system design</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.590" end="00:34:11.050" style="s2">that gives rise to a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.020" end="00:34:12.370" style="s2">collective intelligence I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.050" end="00:34:14.919" style="s2">say for example the Chinese People&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.370" end="00:34:16.600" style="s2">Army is the system design that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.919" end="00:34:18.399" style="s2">access to a certain level of collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.600" end="00:34:19.840" style="s2">intelligence you and I in collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.399" end="00:34:21.340" style="s2">right now or a system design that gives</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.840" end="00:34:24.460" style="s2">rise to a certain level of potential</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.340" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">collective intelligence and then global</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.460" end="00:34:27.899" style="s2">techno capitalism is a system design</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:31.510" style="s2">that gives rise to a certain level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.899" end="00:34:33.399" style="s2">collective intelligence and I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.510" end="00:34:37.860" style="s2">separating out a particular system</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.399" end="00:34:40.780" style="s2">design from the large arc of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.860" end="00:34:43.840" style="s2">attractor of what we might call Maxum</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.780" end="00:34:45.880" style="s2">intelligence that we might see as being</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.840" end="00:34:49.780" style="s2">that which is pulling in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.880" end="00:34:52.300" style="s2">creating an evolutionary pull for all</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.780" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">the various systems designs that are in</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.300" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">competition with each other so in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:34:58.690" style="s2">context where I the way I&#39;ve sort of I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:01.600" style="s2">personally have described history is</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.690" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">that there was for a long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.600" end="00:35:07.030" style="s2">a relatively small amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">intelligence attractor in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.030" end="00:35:15.010" style="s2">the strictly thermodynamic attractor and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:16.180" style="s2">the dissipative structure attractor that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.010" end="00:35:19.600" style="s2">is characteristic of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.180" end="00:35:24.130" style="s2">biological evolution but over time</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.600" end="00:35:27.070" style="s2">because of the intrinsic higher than</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.130" end="00:35:29.560" style="s2">super super linear characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.070" end="00:35:31.990" style="s2">the intelligence attractor it has played</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.560" end="00:35:33.180" style="s2">a larger and larger role the famous</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.990" end="00:35:36.150" style="s2">exponential</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.180" end="00:35:38.700" style="s2">and so we we are now poised in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.150" end="00:35:40.800" style="s2">position where the combined forces of</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.700" end="00:35:44.369" style="s2">the thermodynamic and the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.800" end="00:35:48.810" style="s2">attractors are beginning to lose their</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.369" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">sway over the resources of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.810" end="00:35:52.710" style="s2">favor of some configuration which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:55.819" style="s2">more fully in alignment with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.710" end="00:35:58.109" style="s2">dynamics of the intelligence attractor</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.819" end="00:35:59.220" style="s2">okay that&#39;s that&#39;s fascinating so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.109" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">drawing a distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.220" end="00:36:02.220" style="s2">evolutionary attractor and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:03.450" style="s2">intelligence attractor because I would</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.220" end="00:36:05.069" style="s2">have thought of those as basically the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.450" end="00:36:07.650" style="s2">same thing so maybe you could speak more</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.069" end="00:36:11.450" style="s2">to that it&#39;s not sure yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.650" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">evolutionary attractor is dominated by</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.450" end="00:36:19.410" style="s2">the necessity of seeking maximally</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:25.369" style="s2">efficient in energetic processing</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.410" end="00:36:27.720" style="s2">systems and has episodic access to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.369" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">the innovative capacities that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.720" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">intelligence attractor on a playing</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:37.109" style="s2">field that is still dominated by</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.630" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">energetic dynamics okay okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.109" end="00:36:41.400" style="s2">basically it it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:43.380" style="s2">that yeah that explains a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.400" end="00:36:45.930" style="s2">the the friction I guess in in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.380" end="00:36:47.760" style="s2">ontology is then because but that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.930" end="00:36:50.900" style="s2">good that&#39;s that&#39;s useful because I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.760" end="00:36:54.720" style="s2">thinking more along the lines that in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.900" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">cues your ontology I think of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.720" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">as a kind of abstract system design that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:04.920" style="s2">is itself a kind of intelligence because</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:09.329" style="s2">it&#39;s doing something it&#39;s in its</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.920" end="00:37:11.310" style="s2">processing information and it&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.329" end="00:37:12.869" style="s2">something but we as humans don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.310" end="00:37:14.460" style="s2">where we don&#39;t know exactly what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.869" end="00:37:17.510" style="s2">doing we don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.460" end="00:37:20.220" style="s2">right yeah but so this is some easily</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.510" end="00:37:23.880" style="s2">repeat what I said using the the now</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.220" end="00:37:26.460" style="s2">shared language it&#39;s doing two things it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.880" end="00:37:29.730" style="s2">is processing information and it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.460" end="00:37:31.530" style="s2">processing energy and the energetic</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.730" end="00:37:32.970" style="s2">processing is the dominant</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.530" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">characteristic of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.970" end="00:37:38.339" style="s2">attractor and the information processing</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:40.170" style="s2">is this secondary characteristic so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.339" end="00:37:41.490" style="s2">is why we talk about the thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.170" end="00:37:43.619" style="s2">survival of the fittest or they</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.490" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">selection event is this election event</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.619" end="00:37:49.420" style="s2">at the level of energetics and</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:51.340" style="s2">level of information replication so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.420" end="00:37:55.150" style="s2">have to survive and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.340" end="00:37:57.210" style="s2">reproduce and since most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.150" end="00:37:59.380" style="s2">problematics that are resolved by</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.210" end="00:38:01.060" style="s2">biologically evolved systems have to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.380" end="00:38:07.300" style="s2">with competition for scarce energetic</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.060" end="00:38:09.790" style="s2">resources the primary selection event</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.300" end="00:38:12.070" style="s2">for information processing has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.790" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">biased towards effectiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.070" end="00:38:19.720" style="s2">efficiency as opposed to generativity</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:24.550" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll give you an example Bletchley</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.720" end="00:38:29.910" style="s2">Park so in Bletchley Park the exigencies</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.550" end="00:38:32.200" style="s2">of the energetic conflict overrode the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.910" end="00:38:35.170" style="s2">information processing aspirations of</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.200" end="00:38:36.340" style="s2">Turing so Turing head as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.170" end="00:38:37.900" style="s2">representative of somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.340" end="00:38:41.700" style="s2">operating at a very high level in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.900" end="00:38:45.370" style="s2">intelligence domain had to subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.700" end="00:38:46.690" style="s2">the what may have been a dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.370" end="00:38:49.330" style="s2">can you imagine what would happen if the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.690" end="00:38:50.980" style="s2">resources of Bletchley Park if Turing</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.330" end="00:38:53.500" style="s2">had been able to fully coordinate the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.980" end="00:38:54.910" style="s2">allocation of those resources but he</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.500" end="00:38:57.130" style="s2">couldn&#39;t because he was operating in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.910" end="00:38:58.390" style="s2">context which is actually designed very</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.130" end="00:39:01.120" style="s2">much like your sort of modern pre</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.390" end="00:39:02.440" style="s2">modernity post modernity metaphor he was</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.120" end="00:39:04.170" style="s2">operating in a system which was still</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.440" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">intrinsically designed to round</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.170" end="00:39:09.130" style="s2">preservation of energetic resources and</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:12.810" style="s2">local selective advantages in an</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.130" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">energetic conflict hmm so it used</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.810" end="00:39:18.490" style="s2">innovation it used intelligence but it</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:22.210" style="s2">used intelligence as opposed to being</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.490" end="00:39:25.650" style="s2">driven by intelligence first so do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.210" end="00:39:28.650" style="s2">agree with kind of a proposition I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.650" end="00:39:32.170" style="s2">alluding to implicitly which is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.650" end="00:39:35.340" style="s2">capitalism is a kind of global force</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.170" end="00:39:38.530" style="s2">that is in Crete is is shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.340" end="00:39:41.170" style="s2">distribution of of selection pressure it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.530" end="00:39:44.110" style="s2">towards intelligence do you say that or</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.170" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">no I do right and so if you think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.110" end="00:39:49.750" style="s2">the blue church is kind of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:54.330" style="s2">kind of this like union of humans trying</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.750" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">to basically kind of hold up this this</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.330" end="00:40:00.130" style="s2">agreement to to to select for things</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:02.140" style="s2">other than</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.130" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">intelligence against the increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.140" end="00:40:09.010" style="s2">strong selection pressures of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:10.510" style="s2">and oh that&#39;s neat I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.010" end="00:40:12.520" style="s2">thought about it in that fashion and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.510" end="00:40:13.930" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say that it was other than</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.520" end="00:40:18.190" style="s2">intelligence but I would say in addition</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.930" end="00:40:21.630" style="s2">to so the blue the blue church is a so</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.190" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">sort of not monomaniacal in its</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.630" end="00:40:28.390" style="s2">optimization efforts or at least it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:30.430" style="s2">not monomaniacal against pure</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.390" end="00:40:32.620" style="s2">intelligence whereas as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.430" end="00:40:34.810" style="s2">capitalism may in fact be mana</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.620" end="00:40:36.490" style="s2">maniacally optimizing for a particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.810" end="00:40:38.410" style="s2">kind of intelligence so then this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.490" end="00:40:41.290" style="s2">where I maybe I break with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.410" end="00:40:45.190" style="s2">narrative it is my considered</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.290" end="00:40:48.670" style="s2">perspective that as a systems design and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.190" end="00:40:51.970" style="s2">as an intent capitalism is optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.670" end="00:40:53.380" style="s2">for the wrong kind of intelligence which</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.970" end="00:40:57.520" style="s2">is to say the kind that is less</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.380" end="00:40:59.440" style="s2">intelligent and is a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.520" end="00:41:03.730" style="s2">inefficient and in fact intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.440" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">self terminating systems design so it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.730" end="00:41:06.850" style="s2">something that needs to be considered</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:12.100" style="s2">and is in fact something that we find</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.850" end="00:41:13.510" style="s2">ourselves in in conflict with but I see</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.100" end="00:41:17.100" style="s2">no reason I have actually had very</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.510" end="00:41:19.060" style="s2">strong reasons to believe that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.100" end="00:41:20.580" style="s2">how do I say this right there&#39;s a term</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.060" end="00:41:24.970" style="s2">that we used to use</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.580" end="00:41:26.620" style="s2">so how godlike in power hmm so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.970" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">interesting I mean that it definitely</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.620" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">flatters my priors and and moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:35.830" style="s2">intuitions for sure but I am curious</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:39.190" style="s2">maybe you could say more about how like</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.830" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">how do you substantiate a a reference to</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.190" end="00:41:46.180" style="s2">a superior form of intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:48.460" style="s2">that you could argue is is superior to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.180" end="00:41:51.010" style="s2">that which is being selected by the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.460" end="00:41:53.370" style="s2">intelligent system we&#39;ve ever had do you</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.010" end="00:41:53.370" style="s2">know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.340" end="00:42:01.000" style="s2">actually I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.530" end="00:42:02.500" style="s2">confusing question so maybe say it again</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.000" end="00:42:03.580" style="s2">it seems obvious to me so I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.500" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">I want to see what I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.580" end="00:42:09.270" style="s2">sure so I too want to think it sure</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:11.140" style="s2">seems to me also that capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.270" end="00:42:12.490" style="s2">selects very particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.140" end="00:42:13.450" style="s2">intelligence and as the system as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.490" end="00:42:15.490" style="s2">whole its</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.450" end="00:42:17.109" style="s2">quite irrational and lacking in another</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.490" end="00:42:19.630" style="s2">kind of intelligence from another</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.109" end="00:42:19.990" style="s2">perspective obviously so I&#39;m on board</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.630" end="00:42:21.790" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.990" end="00:42:24.460" style="s2">but well then what I try to I try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.790" end="00:42:26.170" style="s2">think that through and if capitalism is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.460" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">this kind of collective super</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.170" end="00:42:29.530" style="s2">intelligence over and above all of our</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:32.109" style="s2">heads and it capitalism you know global</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.530" end="00:42:34.630" style="s2">prices global price system integrates</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.109" end="00:42:37.270" style="s2">more like global capitalism knows more</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.630" end="00:42:40.170" style="s2">about what we want than we do in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.270" end="00:42:43.660" style="s2">sense precisely it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of insane</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.170" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">brutality is in some sense precisely</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.660" end="00:42:52.119" style="s2">that it it it&#39;s able to kind of measure</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:55.750" style="s2">and allocate and distribute resources in</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.119" end="00:42:58.030" style="s2">line with the sum total of human desires</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.750" end="00:43:00.460" style="s2">in a way that is actually more effective</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.030" end="00:43:03.970" style="s2">and more intelligent than any of us</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.460" end="00:43:06.040" style="s2">could could create you know um you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.970" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">through like purposeful designed like</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.040" end="00:43:13.599" style="s2">planning programs mm-hm and so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:16.140" style="s2">to me that it&#39;s very difficult to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.599" end="00:43:18.069" style="s2">that there exists some other standard of</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:20.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s some other form of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.069" end="00:43:23.170" style="s2">intelligence that we could point to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.920" end="00:43:25.660" style="s2">that would be like more intelligent than</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.170" end="00:43:31.900" style="s2">whatever it is capitalism is is telling</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.660" end="00:43:34.150" style="s2">us should come next oh okay yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.900" end="00:43:35.319" style="s2">makes sense and it still strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.150" end="00:43:39.569" style="s2">obvious so let&#39;s actually walk through a</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.319" end="00:43:39.569" style="s2">little bit okay um let me think</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.690" end="00:43:48.190" style="s2">hmm how do we do this right let me try</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.839" end="00:43:49.810" style="s2">one path I don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.190" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">but it might kind of help move this</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.810" end="00:43:56.349" style="s2">forward a little bit go for it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:58.089" style="s2">with the ability to actually take we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.349" end="00:44:00.099" style="s2">actually look at the system design of</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.089" end="00:44:02.380" style="s2">capitalism we can look at it at its</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.099" end="00:44:08.740" style="s2">intrinsic dynamics and therefore we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.380" end="00:44:13.990" style="s2">actually model the the kind of processes</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.740" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">that it&#39;s capable of operating in and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.990" end="00:44:17.710" style="s2">can understand what the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:20.109" style="s2">conditions are because we can model it</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.710" end="00:44:24.099" style="s2">and so that we can then begin to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.109" end="00:44:25.810" style="s2">okay well given that what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.099" end="00:44:27.220" style="s2">are we designed that may in fact give</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.810" end="00:44:29.339" style="s2">rise to a higher or</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.220" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">and now it may not be actual so up</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.339" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">ontological proposition possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:37.569" style="s2">probable actual so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.920" end="00:44:39.640" style="s2">distinction and we can take a look at it</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.569" end="00:44:42.190" style="s2">say oh there&#39;s a way of identifying that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.640" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">the possible intelligence of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.190" end="00:44:47.290" style="s2">is X the actual intelligence of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:49.810" style="s2">capitalism is something smaller than X</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.290" end="00:44:51.430" style="s2">but actually relatively close to X can</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.810" end="00:44:52.810" style="s2">we design a form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.430" end="00:44:55.720" style="s2">intelligence where the possible</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.810" end="00:44:58.510" style="s2">intelligence is larger than X and that</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.720" end="00:45:02.440" style="s2">the actual intelligence is able to move</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.510" end="00:45:06.670" style="s2">from 0 to larger than X in the context</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.440" end="00:45:08.500" style="s2">of capitalism so we can we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.670" end="00:45:10.390" style="s2">first of all we can actually do that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.500" end="00:45:12.400" style="s2">recognize that the same exact</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.390" end="00:45:13.540" style="s2">relationship ah cool this is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.400" end="00:45:15.609" style="s2">metaphor of the previous discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.540" end="00:45:17.319" style="s2">Bletchley Park capitalism is Bletchley</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.609" end="00:45:19.660" style="s2">Park this is sort of the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.319" end="00:45:22.450" style="s2">this is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.660" end="00:45:24.970" style="s2">it is a systems architecture which was</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.450" end="00:45:26.740" style="s2">originated in a context of fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.970" end="00:45:29.740" style="s2">trying to solve the problem of energetic</p>

<p begin="00:45:33.069" end="00:45:37.690" style="s2">endeavors to constantly control it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.079" end="00:45:41.260" style="s2">like modern it&#39;s a parameter to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.690" end="00:45:43.540" style="s2">modernity modernity took the tried to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.260" end="00:45:46.329" style="s2">take the notion of intelligence and put</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.540" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">it in a control structure and use the</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.329" end="00:45:50.079" style="s2">control structure to give act a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:52.450" style="s2">selective advantage by getting access to</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.450" end="00:45:55.839" style="s2">but in the context of a control</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.780" style="s2">structure is like a steam engine or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.839" end="00:46:01.680" style="s2">train exact right metaphor and so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.780" end="00:46:05.020" style="s2">does is it says okay fine Minh and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.680" end="00:46:07.780" style="s2">Oppenheimer get together and work on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.020" end="00:46:09.640" style="s2">Manhattan Project but we the military</p>

<p begin="00:46:17.050" end="00:46:20.740" style="s2">and don&#39;t go any faster than you can go</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.630" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">Bletchley Park is the same thing Google</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.740" end="00:46:26.500" style="s2">is the same thing right how do we enable</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:28.510" style="s2">the innovative capacity of human</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.500" end="00:46:33.550" style="s2">intelligence in various kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:46:36.069" end="00:46:40.300" style="s2">under the constraints the capital is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.050" end="00:46:42.940" style="s2">it&#39;s capitalism itself</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.300" end="00:46:44.200" style="s2">sets in this case for example it has to</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.940" end="00:46:47.020" style="s2">actually have a high quality return</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.200" end="00:46:48.640" style="s2">investment otherwise it should it throws</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.020" end="00:46:50.320" style="s2">an error it cannot actually be perceived</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.640" end="00:46:52.390" style="s2">as a valid use of intelligence in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.320" end="00:46:53.350" style="s2">context of capitalism all right we see</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.390" end="00:46:55.480" style="s2">things like for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.350" end="00:47:00.640" style="s2">cryptocurrency space we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.480" end="00:47:03.310" style="s2">see the recognition of a blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.640" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">in the form of intelligence the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.310" end="00:47:07.690" style="s2">making and choice making capacities that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:10.600" style="s2">describe the total of sovereignty the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.690" end="00:47:11.950" style="s2">geometric sovereignty of capitalism and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.600" end="00:47:14.110" style="s2">we&#39;re beginning to notice that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.950" end="00:47:16.180" style="s2">in fact an abstraction layer that</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.110" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">capitalism is an instantiation of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.180" end="00:47:19.870" style="s2">abstraction layer we can identify that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:21.160" style="s2">abstraction layer and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.870" end="00:47:22.690" style="s2">actually use principle design to</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.160" end="00:47:24.940" style="s2">construct a form of collective</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.690" end="00:47:27.820" style="s2">intelligence which is categorically</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.940" end="00:47:28.510" style="s2">superior to capitalism and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.820" end="00:47:31.930" style="s2">pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.510" end="00:47:33.780" style="s2">we just invert the relationship please</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.930" end="00:47:36.340" style="s2">tell me more about that sounds good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.780" end="00:47:41.740" style="s2">so so let me just kind of drop again</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.340" end="00:47:43.660" style="s2">into a narrative so let&#39;s take let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.740" end="00:47:45.130" style="s2">actually take the actual narrative of</p>

<p begin="00:48:29.740" end="00:48:35.020" style="s2">that are earlier in the tree mmm-hmm so</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.380" end="00:48:36.820" style="s2">by any measure if I take the total</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.020" end="00:48:39.130" style="s2">number of human beings collaborating in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.820" end="00:48:40.480" style="s2">the space of Google and I measure the</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.720" end="00:49:02.170" style="s2">in terms of actuation so almost nil</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.030" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a classic blue church construct so</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.170" end="00:49:05.020" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece the second piece is</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:06.070" style="s2">then week okay so this says this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.020" end="00:49:08.260" style="s2">actually part of this arcs that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.070" end="00:49:09.700" style="s2">talking about cool and this is a story</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.260" end="00:49:11.800" style="s2">where capitalism is endeavoring to</p>

<p begin="00:49:18.910" end="00:49:22.210" style="s2">right machines that then collaborate</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.210" end="00:49:26.380" style="s2">are in fact even more collectively</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.650" end="00:49:27.880" style="s2">intelligent so then we take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.380" end="00:49:30.910" style="s2">the actual characteristics of what that</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.880" end="00:49:34.900" style="s2">evolutionary dynamic looks like and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.910" end="00:49:39.400" style="s2">we notice is a an increasing shift from</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.900" end="00:49:42.910" style="s2">a an organizational and a human</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.400" end="00:49:47.080" style="s2">resources basis towards a certain kind</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.970" end="00:49:56.740" style="s2">relationships which is to say you want a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.820" end="00:49:58.450" style="s2">more a flatter you want a vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.740" end="00:50:00.850" style="s2">abundance oriented we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.450" end="00:50:03.010" style="s2">kind of open up that can of worms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.850" end="00:50:05.470" style="s2">what that set of concepts means but a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.010" end="00:50:09.070" style="s2">different structure of motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.470" end="00:50:12.040" style="s2">orientation direction and a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.070" end="00:50:15.010" style="s2">topology of the organizational framework</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.040" end="00:50:17.530" style="s2">which is same or driven by agency at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:19.480" style="s2">edge and in collaborative groups and</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.530" end="00:50:21.640" style="s2">less driven by top-down command and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.480" end="00:50:24.460" style="s2">control I could say by the way that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.640" end="00:50:27.300" style="s2">Apple under Jobs and Tesla under musk</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.460" end="00:50:30.490" style="s2">perhaps would present a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.300" end="00:50:32.440" style="s2">phylogenetic tree a much more much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.490" end="00:50:33.850" style="s2">top-down driven but still highly</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.440" end="00:50:35.320" style="s2">optimized kind of construct that has</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.850" end="00:50:39.970" style="s2">certain intelligence capabilities for</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.320" end="00:50:41.440" style="s2">sure that&#39;s fascinating Jordan now the</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.970" end="00:50:44.560" style="s2">question one question I have though is</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.440" end="00:50:47.920" style="s2">do you see that as something that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.560" end="00:50:51.220" style="s2">primarily have to engineer as you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.920" end="00:50:54.070" style="s2">thinking reflective creative agents</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.220" end="00:50:56.170" style="s2">operating on social reality or is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.070" end="00:50:59.380" style="s2">you just described in the last part is</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.170" end="00:51:03.250" style="s2">that endogenous to capitalism almost in</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.380" end="00:51:05.890" style="s2">a kind of Markson eschatology in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.250" end="00:51:07.579" style="s2">capitalism at a certain point starts to</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.890" end="00:51:12.589" style="s2">follow these kind of flat</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.579" end="00:51:14.059" style="s2">dynamics that you just described um well</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.589" end="00:51:17.809" style="s2">I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t understand anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.059" end="00:51:20.690" style="s2">but both yeah at the end of the day it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.809" end="00:51:22.789" style="s2">is in fact the actual creative</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.690" end="00:51:25.880" style="s2">intelligence and the actuated activity</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.789" end="00:51:28.729" style="s2">of discrete human beings that are summed</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.880" end="00:51:31.660" style="s2">in some way and oriented directed in</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.729" end="00:51:36.349" style="s2">some way that we would call capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.660" end="00:51:38.809" style="s2">so right if nobody if all people chose</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.349" end="00:51:41.779" style="s2">to think nothing capitalism would do</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.809" end="00:51:44.209" style="s2">nothing there&#39;s nothing to it besides</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.779" end="00:51:47.229" style="s2">the collective activity of people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.209" end="00:51:51.950" style="s2">okay what is it it&#39;s a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.229" end="00:51:54.920" style="s2">orienting people towards what they</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.950" end="00:51:57.170" style="s2">should be thinking about how they should</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.920" end="00:52:00.229" style="s2">be going about doing it and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.170" end="00:52:03.109" style="s2">enabling scale larger than end</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.229" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">coordination between people and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.109" end="00:52:05.930" style="s2">scale larger than in coordination</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:08.390" style="s2">between scale are the larger than any</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.930" end="00:52:10.759" style="s2">groups so capitalism is a systems</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.390" end="00:52:13.309" style="s2">architecture that enables the formation</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.759" end="00:52:14.809" style="s2">of groups of people who coordinate with</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.309" end="00:52:17.749" style="s2">each other and that groups coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.809" end="00:52:20.809" style="s2">with groups and that allows orientation</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.749" end="00:52:23.209" style="s2">where individuals can identify what role</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.809" end="00:52:25.339" style="s2">they should be playing and what</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.209" end="00:52:28.009" style="s2">relationships they should form in these</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.339" end="00:52:31.249" style="s2">possible coordination structures okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.009" end="00:52:32.959" style="s2">right and so by being that it produces a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.249" end="00:52:34.999" style="s2">larger scale effective collective</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.959" end="00:52:36.650" style="s2">intelligence okay</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.999" end="00:52:39.529" style="s2">excellent excellent and so you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.650" end="00:52:41.420" style="s2">that we&#39;re in this kind of transitional</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.529" end="00:52:43.640" style="s2">moment right now is that right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.420" end="00:52:47.299" style="s2">yeah yeah the blue church is giving way</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.640" end="00:52:48.739" style="s2">to a new kind of dynamic in which the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.299" end="00:52:50.449" style="s2">the central features are what did you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.739" end="00:52:54.650" style="s2">say before are kind of flattening and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.449" end="00:52:55.880" style="s2">kind of post-scarcity a situation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.650" end="00:52:58.719" style="s2">abundance was there something else</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.880" end="00:53:01.069" style="s2">that&#39;s key in there oh there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.719" end="00:53:03.289" style="s2">what is it what I mean what is what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.069" end="00:53:06.349" style="s2">the main features or characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.289" end="00:53:08.719" style="s2">the of this transition and other other</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.349" end="00:53:10.459" style="s2">than those so let me let me actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.719" end="00:53:14.329" style="s2">slow down then so what I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.459" end="00:53:15.259" style="s2">about was what I perceive as being the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.329" end="00:53:17.029" style="s2">characteristics of the particular</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.259" end="00:53:18.619" style="s2">attractor that I was talking about in</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.029" end="00:53:20.430" style="s2">that fellow genetic tree they led to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.619" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">Google</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.430" end="00:53:26.010" style="s2">to slow down and talk about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:29.099" style="s2">happening in this transition there is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.010" end="00:53:32.410" style="s2">space that is opening up for</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.099" end="00:53:36.609" style="s2">experimentations in many different forms</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.410" end="00:53:39.069" style="s2">of collective intelligence that are more</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.609" end="00:53:43.299" style="s2">effective than the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.069" end="00:53:44.890" style="s2">architectures okay there are probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.299" end="00:53:46.450" style="s2">many many like I don&#39;t know exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.890" end="00:53:49.390" style="s2">many there are variations on this theme</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.450" end="00:53:51.880" style="s2">so even all we have to do is look at for</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.390" end="00:53:52.990" style="s2">example the distinct characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.880" end="00:53:55.240" style="s2">that are showing up in just the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.990" end="00:53:56.680" style="s2">blockchain space as efforts to explore</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.240" end="00:54:00.069" style="s2">different kinds of collective</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.680" end="00:54:02.410" style="s2">intelligence structure I mean there&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.069" end="00:54:04.210" style="s2">least three and maybe dozens that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.410" end="00:54:06.670" style="s2">currently being explored it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.210" end="00:54:08.799" style="s2">which of those have any real stability</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.670" end="00:54:10.210" style="s2">and obviously it&#39;s it&#39;s one thing to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.799" end="00:54:14.829" style="s2">design something is another thing for to</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.210" end="00:54:17.740" style="s2">achieve homeostatic equilibrium the</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.829" end="00:54:19.780" style="s2">question is so in in this context I</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.740" end="00:54:22.569" style="s2">actually sorry Beckett people further I</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.780" end="00:54:23.890" style="s2">have basically identified in my own mind</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.569" end="00:54:25.630" style="s2">the way I think about it a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.890" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">strategic level these three time</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.630" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">timeframes</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:35.380" style="s2">there&#39;s the exiting the blue church so</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of an exiting legacy which</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.380" end="00:54:38.849" style="s2">largely has to do at a strategic level</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">largely has to do with avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.849" end="00:54:44.890" style="s2">catastrophic effects as the old system</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:48.910" style="s2">gives way then there&#39;s the transition</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.890" end="00:54:50.890" style="s2">then there&#39;s the post transition my my</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.910" end="00:54:52.450" style="s2">considered assessment right now is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.890" end="00:54:53.980" style="s2">it is not necessarily the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.450" end="00:54:56.220" style="s2">transition the post transition are the</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.980" end="00:54:56.220" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.260" end="00:55:00.430" style="s2">I imagine and I can use a number of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.990" end="00:55:02.319" style="s2">different models to explain why I</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.430" end="00:55:10.510" style="s2">imagine but I imagine that there is room</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.319" end="00:55:12.579" style="s2">for call it one more bite at collective</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.510" end="00:55:16.299" style="s2">intelligences that are say still a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.579" end="00:55:18.819" style="s2">hybrid mix between scarcity and in</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.299" end="00:55:22.119" style="s2">abundance fundamental characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.819" end="00:55:24.789" style="s2">right okay and then we we do or do not</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.119" end="00:55:26.369" style="s2">transition and if we do transition then</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.789" end="00:55:28.420" style="s2">you just have to look at what are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.369" end="00:55:30.010" style="s2">stable states that live on the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.420" end="00:55:32.840" style="s2">side of some kind of transition and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.010" end="00:55:35.600" style="s2">there&#39;s only a small number</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.840" end="00:55:37.430" style="s2">okay yeah I mean that definitely syncs</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.600" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">up with my observations in academia</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.430" end="00:55:40.520" style="s2">right now you definitely get this</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:41.840" style="s2">impression that there in academia there</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.520" end="00:55:45.380" style="s2">are a lot of initiatives where they seem</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.840" end="00:55:47.810" style="s2">to be trying really hard to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.380" end="00:55:50.780" style="s2">this transition by taking on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.810" end="00:55:54.560" style="s2">like half-assed gestures towards you</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.780" end="00:55:57.170" style="s2">know abundance and and flattening but</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.560" end="00:56:00.380" style="s2">really they&#39;re yeah they don&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.170" end="00:56:05.000" style="s2">well yeah this is right and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.380" end="00:56:10.340" style="s2">has to do with I think this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.000" end="00:56:12.230" style="s2">kind of am right now the I basically</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.340" end="00:56:13.970" style="s2">broken up into two kinds of games</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.230" end="00:56:18.710" style="s2">I called game a and game B just to make</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.970" end="00:56:20.570" style="s2">it sort of neutral game II game a is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.710" end="00:56:23.840" style="s2">game that in the story that I&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.570" end="00:56:25.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of been playing maybe from</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.840" end="00:56:28.220" style="s2">the dawn of civilization or perhaps from</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.940" end="00:56:31.570" style="s2">the dawn of evolution but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.220" end="00:56:35.950" style="s2">essentially characterized by winning</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.570" end="00:56:38.420" style="s2">rivalries game theoretic games though</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.950" end="00:56:41.590" style="s2">assuming that there will be a loser in</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.420" end="00:56:43.820" style="s2">the game and constructing strategic</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.590" end="00:56:48.350" style="s2">systems to achieve not being the loser</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.820" end="00:56:52.130" style="s2">right and there&#39;s many different</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.350" end="00:56:53.330" style="s2">elements that make up that so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.130" end="00:56:54.950" style="s2">the socio-technical layer</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.330" end="00:56:57.470" style="s2">socio-technical systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.950" end="00:56:59.330" style="s2">constructed both about axiomatic sub</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.470" end="00:57:00.950" style="s2">rivalries game theory and about</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.330" end="00:57:03.110" style="s2">effective strategy in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.950" end="00:57:06.410" style="s2">those axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.110" end="00:57:07.750" style="s2">there are also individual</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.410" end="00:57:12.590" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.750" end="00:57:14.390" style="s2">psycho-emotional axiomatic sand</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.590" end="00:57:15.770" style="s2">strategies and so you have both the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.390" end="00:57:17.570" style="s2">individual and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.770" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">coordinations that are in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.570" end="00:57:26.540" style="s2">with each other that give rise so if I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:29.870" style="s2">have a highly win-lose optimized</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.540" end="00:57:31.880" style="s2">individual entering into a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.870" end="00:57:34.790" style="s2">win-win optimized socio-technical</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.880" end="00:57:38.330" style="s2">environment it won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.790" end="00:57:42.290" style="s2">and if I have a highly abundance mindset</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.330" end="00:57:44.960" style="s2">individual entering into a win-lose</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.290" end="00:57:46.250" style="s2">socio technical infrastructure it also</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.960" end="00:57:47.990" style="s2">tends not to work they will</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.250" end="00:57:52.010" style="s2">show up is sort of it&#39;s a deterrent is</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.990" end="00:57:57.470" style="s2">an example at best at best Jim Morrison</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.010" end="00:57:59.750" style="s2">is another good example okay so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.470" end="00:58:01.460" style="s2">a kind of an eye of a needle problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.750" end="00:58:04.190" style="s2">which is there has to be a transition</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.460" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">from a world that is running human</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.190" end="00:58:11.000" style="s2">beings who&#39;ve developmentally been</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.650" end="00:58:12.500" style="s2">operating in a scarcity environment so</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.000" end="00:58:14.360" style="s2">they have a scarcity literally a</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.500" end="00:58:15.980" style="s2">scarcity biologists care see emotional</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.360" end="00:58:18.530" style="s2">construct or scarcity psychological</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.980" end="00:58:20.180" style="s2">construct and scarcity habits scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.530" end="00:58:21.890" style="s2">frameworks that are running assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.180" end="00:58:24.740" style="s2">and cognitive bias around scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.890" end="00:58:26.060" style="s2">models and that is in fact relatively</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.740" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">adaptive and fit because they are also</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.060" end="00:58:30.020" style="s2">running within a socio technical</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:32.330" style="s2">environment which is axiomatically</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.020" end="00:58:34.240" style="s2">promising the same set of notions and of</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.330" end="00:58:37.640" style="s2">course within a natural environment be</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.240" end="00:58:39.260" style="s2">energetically scarce Fitness landscape</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.640" end="00:58:43.670" style="s2">that is the driver for both of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.260" end="00:58:45.350" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s reality hard-bitten tough</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.670" end="00:58:48.560" style="s2">hard-nosed sort of conservative mindset</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.350" end="00:58:50.750" style="s2">reality and then on the other side you</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.560" end="00:58:52.610" style="s2">have what might be a holistic attractor</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.750" end="00:58:55.190" style="s2">which is actually part of so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.610" end="00:58:57.170" style="s2">transition is a whole whole system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.190" end="00:58:59.660" style="s2">transition including all three of those</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.170" end="00:59:01.400" style="s2">different components so it&#39;s associative</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.660" end="00:59:05.240" style="s2">technical transition as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.400" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">cultural transition and a shift in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.240" end="00:59:14.360" style="s2">actual human beings that are moving into</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:16.250" style="s2">that new context okay fascinating so if</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.360" end="00:59:17.720" style="s2">you do have a kind of post-capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.250" end="00:59:21.140" style="s2">narrative then your because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.720" end="00:59:25.460" style="s2">really kind of describing a vision in</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.140" end="00:59:28.550" style="s2">which people are holistic and it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.460" end="00:59:31.790" style="s2">more cooperative it&#39;s much more coherent</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.550" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">you could say and it&#39;s going to be less</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.790" end="00:59:40.820" style="s2">intensely based on exploitation and</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:42.410" style="s2">competition is that fair to say yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.820" end="00:59:44.300" style="s2">I would say this both in positive and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.410" end="00:59:46.220" style="s2">negative direction which is at the the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.300" end="00:59:47.780" style="s2">negative direction is that all other</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.220" end="00:59:50.290" style="s2">scenarios are inexorably self</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.780" end="00:59:52.790" style="s2">terminating in a relatively short time</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.290" end="00:59:56.060" style="s2">so if you kind of look at it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.790" end="00:59:58.610" style="s2">a possibility space at future paths the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.060" end="00:59:59.750" style="s2">basic routing rules prune all those</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.610" end="01:00:01.730" style="s2">paths away</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.750" end="01:00:03.170" style="s2">so the only available paths are past</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.730" end="01:00:05.240" style="s2">that had they look like what you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.170" end="01:00:07.880" style="s2">describing and then from a positive</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.240" end="01:00:10.340" style="s2">direction there are very strong reasons</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.880" end="01:00:12.200" style="s2">to believe that a these are very well</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.340" end="01:00:15.080" style="s2">within the domain of what human beings</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.200" end="01:00:16.430" style="s2">can be human nature we&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.080" end="01:00:18.770" style="s2">about nature which is talking about</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.430" end="01:00:21.890" style="s2">shifting the state variables within the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.770" end="01:00:25.030" style="s2">phase space of human nature and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.890" end="01:00:28.070" style="s2">there is a direct collaboration between</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.030" end="01:00:30.619" style="s2">cultural and societal constructs that</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.070" end="01:00:33.020" style="s2">are in alignment with that same set of</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.619" end="01:00:34.490" style="s2">human states so they are mutually Co</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.020" end="01:00:36.590" style="s2">evolving and then finally the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.490" end="01:00:38.869" style="s2">positive the best news is that and this</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.590" end="01:00:40.940" style="s2">happens to be fundamentally the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.869" end="01:00:43.250" style="s2">fully optimized for maximal intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.940" end="01:00:44.690" style="s2">that can be achieved in principle so</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.250" end="01:00:48.109" style="s2">it&#39;s the way you actually win the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.690" end="01:00:50.119" style="s2">intelligence game ok that&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.109" end="01:00:52.190" style="s2">though I&#39;m definitely gonna have to just</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.119" end="01:00:58.460" style="s2">sleep on that but that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.190" end="01:01:00.200" style="s2">interesting so in your view what if one</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.460" end="01:01:03.369" style="s2">is attracted to that picture that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.200" end="01:01:05.930" style="s2">just painted you know what is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.369" end="01:01:08.030" style="s2">constructive available pathways to</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.930" end="01:01:11.210" style="s2">living breathing human beings today that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.030" end="01:01:15.109" style="s2">you think can accelerate the transition</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.210" end="01:01:18.859" style="s2">into that to that state hmm</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.109" end="01:01:21.230" style="s2">there&#39;s actually many so I&#39;ve noticed at</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.859" end="01:01:25.160" style="s2">least kind of three basic domains that</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.230" end="01:01:26.869" style="s2">that people seem to be entering into and</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.160" end="01:01:28.700" style="s2">this is not in any particular order but</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.869" end="01:01:30.010" style="s2">I&#39;ll just sort of start my mind can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.700" end="01:01:34.310" style="s2">help but organize things along some</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.010" end="01:01:39.950" style="s2">framework the first is at the individual</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.310" end="01:01:41.859" style="s2">level so as I mentioned the the context</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.950" end="01:01:43.310" style="s2">in which we have developed</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.859" end="01:01:48.369" style="s2">differentially for different people</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.310" end="01:01:48.369" style="s2">obviously gives rise to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.670" end="01:01:55.460" style="s2">individuation a certain level or kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.560" end="01:01:58.490" style="s2">sovereignty in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.460" end="01:02:02.960" style="s2">actually play the new game game B you</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.490" end="01:02:04.430" style="s2">have to upgrade your capacities usually</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.960" end="01:02:05.660" style="s2">almost everyone I&#39;ve never met anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.430" end="01:02:08.750" style="s2">who hasn&#39;t had to upgrade their</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.660" end="01:02:10.490" style="s2">capacities and I&#39;ve never met anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.750" end="01:02:12.380" style="s2">who&#39;s so fully upgraded that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.490" end="01:02:13.760" style="s2">sort of ready to play all the way like</p>

<p begin="01:02:13.760" end="01:02:18.200" style="s2">working really hard to basically be able</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.650" end="01:02:19.310" style="s2">to play some of the time although I may</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.200" end="01:02:20.810" style="s2">have different people are quite</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.310" end="01:02:25.790" style="s2">differentials so this includes things</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.810" end="01:02:30.310" style="s2">like really rather studiously addressing</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.790" end="01:02:33.590" style="s2">any form of developmental or emotional</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.310" end="01:02:36.530" style="s2">traumas that are short-circuiting your</p>

<p begin="01:02:36.530" end="01:02:44.720" style="s2">sovereign fashion you know if you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.970" end="01:02:47.900" style="s2">triggers or defense mechanisms fix them</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.720" end="01:02:50.109" style="s2">Hang Ups yeah yeah and these are this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.900" end="01:02:52.550" style="s2">real work this is non-trivial sure yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.109" end="01:02:54.320" style="s2">secondarily and this is by the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.550" end="01:02:56.300" style="s2">usually in this order because the second</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.320" end="01:03:01.100" style="s2">one is going to be your cognitive</p>

<p begin="01:03:01.100" end="01:03:06.350" style="s2">is Jonathan hate sure yeah yeah so the</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.070" end="01:03:07.970" style="s2">elephant and the writer metaphor that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.350" end="01:03:09.560" style="s2">right and don&#39;t take your cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.970" end="01:03:11.090" style="s2">frameworks too seriously you&#39;ll find</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.560" end="01:03:13.520" style="s2">that if you shift certain emotional</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.090" end="01:03:17.900" style="s2">traumas things that seem so obviously</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.520" end="01:03:19.460" style="s2">true and in arguable fade like mists</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.900" end="01:03:21.230" style="s2">because at the end of the day our</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.460" end="01:03:24.260" style="s2">cognitive frameworks are sitting on top</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.230" end="01:03:26.900" style="s2">of an emotional psychological framework</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.260" end="01:03:29.410" style="s2">or foundation and shifts at the base</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.900" end="01:03:31.820" style="s2">level imply shifts at the surface level</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.410" end="01:03:34.340" style="s2">which is not to say by the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.820" end="01:03:36.500" style="s2">say geometry turns out to be false if</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.340" end="01:03:40.119" style="s2">you learn how to solve your problems</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.500" end="01:03:42.760" style="s2">with attachment but for example</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.119" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">economics will shift for you for sure</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.760" end="01:03:49.250" style="s2">and you&#39;ll actually be able to vastly</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:50.869" style="s2">more fluidly be able to load and unload</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.250" end="01:03:55.030" style="s2">different frameworks and be able to use</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.869" end="01:03:58.310" style="s2">tools as tools as opposed to use them as</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.030" end="01:03:59.900" style="s2">paradigms or as ideologies and so if</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.310" end="01:04:01.460" style="s2">particularly shifting away from anything</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.900" end="01:04:02.780" style="s2">that is attracted to an ideological</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.460" end="01:04:05.060" style="s2">mindset which of course is just an</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.780" end="01:04:07.850" style="s2">externalized version of reason acting as</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.060" end="01:04:10.190" style="s2">defense mechanism so personal that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.850" end="01:04:14.540" style="s2">very powerful the second is then</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.190" end="01:04:17.270" style="s2">relational and I mean this again kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.540" end="01:04:18.680" style="s2">in the same order which is really begin</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.270" end="01:04:20.600" style="s2">to become increasingly a skill of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.680" end="01:04:22.400" style="s2">understanding precisely how you go about</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.600" end="01:04:25.640" style="s2">getting into relationships with other</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.400" end="01:04:27.620" style="s2">people at actually a body level where</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.640" end="01:04:29.930" style="s2">exactly are your various</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.620" end="01:04:34.610" style="s2">hangups emotional traumas psychological</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.930" end="01:04:36.080" style="s2">frameworks bad habits driving and where</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.610" end="01:04:38.090" style="s2">you were actually entering into skillful</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.080" end="01:04:39.830" style="s2">relationship which is at least at the</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.090" end="01:04:44.270" style="s2">level that you would like it to be when</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.830" end="01:04:46.670" style="s2">you&#39;re considering it thoughtfully and</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.270" end="01:04:48.230" style="s2">then begin to get better at so practice</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.670" end="01:04:51.290" style="s2">that and practice doing things like</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.230" end="01:04:53.930" style="s2">having very high integrity and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.290" end="01:04:56.780" style="s2">ability to communicate clearly and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.930" end="01:04:58.960" style="s2">ability to listen well you know basic</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.780" end="01:05:02.020" style="s2">communications protocol cleanliness</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.960" end="01:05:05.030" style="s2">because this is the basic framework so</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.020" end="01:05:08.140" style="s2">the the material out of which this</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.030" end="01:05:11.300" style="s2">future system is based is made up of</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.140" end="01:05:13.400" style="s2">human beings who&#39;ve achieved a certain</p>

<p begin="01:05:13.400" end="01:05:19.130" style="s2">have achieved a capacity to enter into</p>

<p begin="01:05:19.130" end="01:05:26.000" style="s2">on the basis of integrity and high</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.980" end="01:05:27.350" style="s2">quality of communication and this by the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.000" end="01:05:29.060" style="s2">way is principled I can I can actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.350" end="01:05:31.400" style="s2">describe almost at a mathematical level</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.060" end="01:05:34.190" style="s2">why that is the basis of the maximum</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.400" end="01:05:35.750" style="s2">possible collaborative intelligence now</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.190" end="01:05:37.190" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s all very well put I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.750" end="01:05:40.280" style="s2">thinking though that there has to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.190" end="01:05:42.860" style="s2">something else because everything you</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.280" end="01:05:45.050" style="s2">just said could be used to describe a</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.860" end="01:05:49.100" style="s2">lot of you know blue church operatives</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.050" end="01:05:51.170" style="s2">right I mean oh heavens no no you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.100" end="01:05:53.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t think that there you could</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.170" end="01:05:55.550" style="s2">fulfill the criteria that you just laid</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.030" end="01:05:58.460" style="s2">out and I would say that if you were</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.550" end="01:06:01.460" style="s2">currently alive today and you were still</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.460" end="01:06:06.110" style="s2">a blue Church operative you are strictly</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.460" end="01:06:07.670" style="s2">delusional and what portion of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.110" end="01:06:10.760" style="s2">population would you estimate that to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.670" end="01:06:12.980" style="s2">though quite high right oh yes most 85%</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.760" end="01:06:17.380" style="s2">well of people who live in the West</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.980" end="01:06:20.810" style="s2">probably on the order of 95 percent</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.380" end="01:06:23.330" style="s2">right so so are you saying that in your</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.810" end="01:06:25.790" style="s2">model the more people do all of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.330" end="01:06:28.840" style="s2">things you just described intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.790" end="01:06:32.090" style="s2">the more the the social system will</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.840" end="01:06:34.250" style="s2">transition to the alternative post</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.090" end="01:06:37.640" style="s2">capitalist state is that is that your</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.250" end="01:06:40.700" style="s2">view that is true yes so so my question</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.640" end="01:06:43.099" style="s2">or about working there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.700" end="01:06:44.839" style="s2">that if maybe if we talked about that</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.099" end="01:06:46.910" style="s2">might make a little bit more clear okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.839" end="01:06:49.550" style="s2">all I was going to say was that I one</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.910" end="01:06:53.390" style="s2">could imagine people doing all of those</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.550" end="01:06:57.170" style="s2">things and currently existing blue</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.390" end="01:07:00.829" style="s2">church institutions will you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.170" end="01:07:04.250" style="s2">happily integrate those those human</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.829" end="01:07:05.690" style="s2">updates better workers you know my in my</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.250" end="01:07:08.420" style="s2">experience the answer is very much the</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.690" end="01:07:10.579" style="s2">opposite okay you may be able to run a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.420" end="01:07:12.200" style="s2">simulation in fact I would recommend</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.579" end="01:07:14.210" style="s2">that you do if you continue to decide to</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.200" end="01:07:15.650" style="s2">stay employed said the blue church which</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.210" end="01:07:18.230" style="s2">increasing you don&#39;t need to but two</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.650" end="01:07:19.910" style="s2">degree what you do run an emulator where</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.230" end="01:07:22.460" style="s2">you&#39;re showing up as a blue church</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.910" end="01:07:23.900" style="s2">functionary but I would say with a very</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.460" end="01:07:26.210" style="s2">high degree of confidence like here like</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.900" end="01:07:29.180" style="s2">93 percent that the blue church will</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.210" end="01:07:32.560" style="s2">absolutely not have any desire capacity</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.180" end="01:07:34.550" style="s2">or even willingness to integrate a</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.560" end="01:07:36.920" style="s2">individual who&#39;s beginning to move in</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.550" end="01:07:38.150" style="s2">the process of sovereignty yeah you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.920" end="01:07:39.560" style="s2">it&#39;s funny you say that Jordan because</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.150" end="01:07:41.000" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m actually right now in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.560" end="01:07:43.339" style="s2">process of getting starting to get into</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.000" end="01:07:44.839" style="s2">trouble and I&#39;m not even really doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.339" end="01:07:47.030" style="s2">anything that extreme at all it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.839" end="01:07:50.810" style="s2">just from doing these live streams and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.030" end="01:07:52.460" style="s2">just kind of speaking casually I thought</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.810" end="01:07:56.089" style="s2">I already have like a ethics</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.460" end="01:07:58.970" style="s2">investigation oh yeah no I&#39;m yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.089" end="01:08:00.440" style="s2">seriously and so it&#39;s like I guess I see</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.970" end="01:08:02.210" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying that like although</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.440" end="01:08:04.010" style="s2">the criteria that you described are</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.210" end="01:08:07.430" style="s2">relatively straightforward you know be</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.010" end="01:08:09.440" style="s2">honest work your out to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.430" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">you actually do those things it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.440" end="01:08:13.490" style="s2">relatively rare that you actually quite</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:15.920" style="s2">you do become intrinsically a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.490" end="01:08:17.180" style="s2">problem for blue church status quo</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.920" end="01:08:19.310" style="s2">institutions is that that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.180" end="01:08:20.750" style="s2">mean yeah absolutely there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.310" end="01:08:23.390" style="s2">there&#39;s almost nothing more dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.750" end="01:08:25.850" style="s2">and even though the individuals the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.390" end="01:08:30.200" style="s2">human beings who are involved may have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.850" end="01:08:32.120" style="s2">different set of like evaluations of</p>

<p begin="01:08:32.120" end="01:08:37.250" style="s2">structure will intrinsically receive it</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.859" end="01:08:38.810" style="s2">as an infection or an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.250" end="01:08:42.109" style="s2">exploitation so you might find yourself</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.810" end="01:08:44.589" style="s2">shunted into like a Google X or a DARPA</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.109" end="01:08:50.420" style="s2">kind of a place where you can be</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.589" end="01:08:53.029" style="s2">exploited as a game B resource node but</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.200" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">even then you&#39;ll probably find that</p>

<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:26.050" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s fascinating and I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.220" end="01:10:28.720" style="s2">think implicitly I&#39;m I&#39;m very much</p>

<p begin="01:10:36.880" end="01:10:40.600" style="s2">it is just kind of interesting it just</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.170" end="01:10:44.230" style="s2">so happens that in my actual moment in</p>

<p begin="01:10:49.540" end="01:10:53.110" style="s2">know talking about myself for the</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.920" end="01:10:55.270" style="s2">selfish reasons of you know wanting to</p>

<p begin="01:11:02.410" end="01:11:06.940" style="s2">comes to my mind is like let&#39;s so right</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.330" end="01:11:09.580" style="s2">now I mean I&#39;m burning a lot of</p>

<p begin="01:11:09.580" end="01:11:12.670" style="s2">gonna be able to stay in academia I mean</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.320" end="01:11:14.620" style="s2">I have a problem I&#39;m basically tenured</p>

<p begin="01:11:19.570" end="01:11:23.590" style="s2">or this ethics investigation where to</p>

<p begin="01:11:23.590" end="01:11:27.220" style="s2">would be hard for them to fire me I</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.610" end="01:11:30.190" style="s2">think but I&#39;m I&#39;m really starting to</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.220" end="01:11:31.360" style="s2">think like how long should I really stay</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.190" end="01:11:32.890" style="s2">in here lay in other words I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.360" end="01:11:35.170" style="s2">about jumping ship I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.890" end="01:11:36.550" style="s2">for what I think I could probably do</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.170" end="01:11:38.230" style="s2">some sort of I could probably do a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.550" end="01:11:40.150" style="s2">of things whatever without me talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.230" end="01:11:43.060" style="s2">about that too much I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.150" end="01:11:44.500" style="s2">jumping ship and it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.060" end="01:11:46.750" style="s2">interesting kind of case study for that</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.500" end="01:11:50.980" style="s2">what you said about discernment you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.750" end="01:11:56.700" style="s2">because how does one how does one</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.980" end="01:12:01.000" style="s2">discern when one is making a good</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.700" end="01:12:03.430" style="s2">intelligent ethically aligned decision</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.000" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">to defect from status quo institutions</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.430" end="01:12:10.600" style="s2">how does one do certain that from just</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:13.930" style="s2">being lazy and not being able to hack it</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.600" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">and quitting because it&#39;s too hard do</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.930" end="01:12:16.030" style="s2">you know what I mean that&#39;s a part</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:17.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a question of discernment but I</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.030" end="01:12:18.790" style="s2">think a lot of people struggle with and</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.440" end="01:12:20.130" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the one I&#39;m struggling with</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.790" end="01:12:23.620" style="s2">at the moment because I&#39;m sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.130" end="01:12:24.940" style="s2">I&#39;m slow to quit academia because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.620" end="01:12:26.410" style="s2">little proud you know like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.940" end="01:12:28.300" style="s2">to feel like I&#39;m quitting I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.410" end="01:12:30.060" style="s2">to feel like I can&#39;t handle it and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.300" end="01:12:32.350" style="s2">have a I have a strong you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.060" end="01:12:34.630" style="s2">tolerance for pain and suffering I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.350" end="01:12:36.970" style="s2">Catholic and so I&#39;m kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.630" end="01:12:38.980" style="s2">sticking out just stick it out don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.970" end="01:12:41.920" style="s2">don&#39;t be lazy don&#39;t quit but then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.980" end="01:12:45.070" style="s2">like no actually it&#39;s it would be better</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.920" end="01:12:47.700" style="s2">in every way for me to like ditch these</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.070" end="01:12:50.260" style="s2">chains and just go full blast on</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.700" end="01:12:51.790" style="s2">vlogging doing this kind of stuff and</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.260" end="01:12:53.320" style="s2">whatever and then just find another way</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.790" end="01:12:55.630" style="s2">to make money if I want to be an</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.320" end="01:12:59.320" style="s2">intellectual that is you know so I I</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.630" end="01:13:01.150" style="s2">have for myself formula didn&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.320" end="01:13:01.750" style="s2">that question I struggle with that same</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.150" end="01:13:05.860" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.750" end="01:13:07.120" style="s2">when I began this journey this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.860" end="01:13:08.800" style="s2">language that I haven&#39;t refined in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.120" end="01:13:10.750" style="s2">long time so it&#39;s a little bit rough but</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.800" end="01:13:15.190" style="s2">if you would like I&#39;ll share it with you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.750" end="01:13:17.620" style="s2">sure please so and you you use the word</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.190" end="01:13:20.140" style="s2">Catholic reminded me of it so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.620" end="01:13:20.870" style="s2">noticed at least I noticed in my life</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.140" end="01:13:25.100" style="s2">that there see</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.870" end="01:13:28.820" style="s2">to be two very distinct ways of going</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.100" end="01:13:30.500" style="s2">about trying to make that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.820" end="01:13:33.160" style="s2">distinction that took that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.500" end="01:13:35.180" style="s2">choice that question of discernment well</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.160" end="01:13:36.440" style="s2">what I&#39;ll call judgment the other I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.180" end="01:13:41.300" style="s2">call the Sermon just to put to give them</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.440" end="01:13:43.930" style="s2">different names so judgment appears to</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.300" end="01:13:46.850" style="s2">me to be something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.930" end="01:13:49.900" style="s2">endeavoring to engage in an analytical</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.850" end="01:13:51.620" style="s2">process against some kind of schema and</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.900" end="01:13:55.610" style="s2">locate a choice</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.620" end="01:13:58.490" style="s2">inside that schema so a simple one might</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.610" end="01:14:01.790" style="s2">be something like don&#39;t touch hot things</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.490" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">and so then all you have to do is you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.790" end="01:14:05.090" style="s2">have to engage in an assessment of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:06.980" style="s2">environment and when you identify</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.090" end="01:14:08.180" style="s2">something as hot you access the scheme</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.980" end="01:14:09.770" style="s2">and the schema has a very simple rule</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.180" end="01:14:12.380" style="s2">don&#39;t touch hot things is this thing hot</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.770" end="01:14:14.960" style="s2">yes therefore don&#39;t touch so you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.380" end="01:14:18.260" style="s2">to run a very effective code that has</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.960" end="01:14:20.300" style="s2">States and it has actions associated</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.260" end="01:14:22.450" style="s2">with those states and your job is only</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.300" end="01:14:25.270" style="s2">to be able to with high fidelity</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.450" end="01:14:29.240" style="s2">evaluate States and apply actions I</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.270" end="01:14:31.610" style="s2">might call this a moral schema okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.240" end="01:14:33.620" style="s2">the reference to Catholicism now you run</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.610" end="01:14:37.280" style="s2">into conundrums in this place where</p>

<p begin="01:15:16.850" end="01:15:19.880" style="s2">this by the way is something that</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.590" end="01:15:22.130" style="s2">happens in evolutionary theory a lot</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.880" end="01:15:26.210" style="s2">like organisms that are optimized for</p>

<p begin="01:15:29.000" end="01:15:35.080" style="s2">sort of an evolutionary trap any moral</p>

<p begin="01:15:35.090" end="01:15:39.770" style="s2">has to do with with essentially</p>

<p begin="01:15:45.590" end="01:15:49.159" style="s2">the answer to the question in a second</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.360" end="01:15:52.579" style="s2">category is something oh let&#39;s put this</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.159" end="01:15:55.780" style="s2">way in the first category a good choice</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.579" end="01:15:58.250" style="s2">is something like a choice that</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.780" end="01:16:01.880" style="s2">accurately assesses what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.250" end="01:16:05.900" style="s2">reality and well deploys the right</p>

<p begin="01:16:05.900" end="01:16:11.690" style="s2">choice is the kind of choice that a good</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.690" end="01:16:16.429" style="s2">this kind of discernment actually means</p>

<p begin="01:16:16.429" end="01:16:24.020" style="s2">like build embodied wisdom you know put</p>

<p begin="01:16:24.020" end="01:16:28.820" style="s2">make hard choices so you have a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.559" end="01:16:32.000" style="s2">what it feels like to make a good choice</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.820" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">in the context of hard choices become</p>

<p begin="01:16:38.719" end="01:16:43.099" style="s2">if you find that you tend to bias</p>

<p begin="01:16:43.099" end="01:16:46.969" style="s2">where you&#39;re maybe not listening to what</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.260" end="01:16:48.500" style="s2">would be called say your gut which is a</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.520" end="01:16:59.719" style="s2">notice where you find yourself engaging</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.500" end="01:17:01.099" style="s2">in self tyranny where you don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.719" end="01:17:02.210" style="s2">allow yourself to be in personal</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.099" end="01:17:03.889" style="s2">integrity where all the different</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.210" end="01:17:06.949" style="s2">aspects of yourself are able to speak</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.889" end="01:17:08.449" style="s2">their particular perspectives openly and</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.949" end="01:17:12.590" style="s2">honestly and are listen to completely</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.449" end="01:17:14.210" style="s2">before decisions are made because if you</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.590" end="01:17:15.530" style="s2">don&#39;t do that then if you make a choice</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.210" end="01:17:18.199" style="s2">the parts of you that weren&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.530" end="01:17:21.829" style="s2">to will be resentful and they will tend</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.199" end="01:17:23.869" style="s2">to take it out on you post facto so this</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.829" end="01:17:26.420" style="s2">is so the second case is about building</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.869" end="01:17:28.610" style="s2">character and building capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.420" end="01:17:31.579" style="s2">become skillful and choice making in its</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.610" end="01:17:33.739" style="s2">raw sense and of course as you do that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.579" end="01:17:35.270" style="s2">you will notice that you become less and</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.739" end="01:17:36.289" style="s2">less concerned with the quality of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.270" end="01:17:37.849" style="s2">choices that you&#39;re making because</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.289" end="01:17:41.030" style="s2">you&#39;re just really good at that as a</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.849" end="01:17:43.960" style="s2">fundamental capacity now let me just</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.030" end="01:17:46.000" style="s2">embed that in a larger narrative when</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.960" end="01:17:49.810" style="s2">this when the environment is relatively</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.000" end="01:17:51.580" style="s2">static the former kind of approach can</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.810" end="01:17:54.219" style="s2">actually be more effective than the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.580" end="01:17:56.230" style="s2">latter kind like I said if the universe</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.219" end="01:17:58.150" style="s2">consists only of objects that are hot</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.230" end="01:18:00.370" style="s2">and objects that are not hot and only</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.150" end="01:18:02.380" style="s2">touch and not touch then the schema</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.370" end="01:18:03.850" style="s2">don&#39;t touch hot things is actually very</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.380" end="01:18:07.510" style="s2">very efficient if you optimize for that</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.850" end="01:18:09.219" style="s2">you can kick ass right however is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.510" end="01:18:11.050" style="s2">complexity environment grows and</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.219" end="01:18:12.460" style="s2">particularly as the novelty in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.050" end="01:18:15.030" style="s2">environment grows if they even if the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.460" end="01:18:17.140" style="s2">environment is changing then</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.030" end="01:18:20.350" style="s2">categorically the second approach is</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.140" end="01:18:21.340" style="s2">more adaptive right that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.350" end="01:18:23.080" style="s2">yeah I never really thought about that</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.340" end="01:18:24.430" style="s2">exactly but you could kind of you could</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.080" end="01:18:27.610" style="s2">kind of advance the proposition that</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.430" end="01:18:30.120" style="s2">with the acceleration of social and</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.610" end="01:18:32.530" style="s2">technological life it that actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.120" end="01:18:36.580" style="s2">increases the payoffs to a strategy</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.530" end="01:18:37.989" style="s2">based on strong character yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.580" end="01:18:39.520" style="s2">interesting to a question yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.989" end="01:18:40.719" style="s2">interesting this is actually another way</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.520" end="01:18:41.760" style="s2">of saying the basic story that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.719" end="01:18:45.580" style="s2">telling throughout this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.760" end="01:18:47.260" style="s2">that once you grasp what that means and</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.580" end="01:18:49.330" style="s2">sort of extrapolate it in terms of its</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.260" end="01:18:51.960" style="s2">individual and relational and social</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.330" end="01:18:54.219" style="s2">consequences you&#39;ve identified what the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.960" end="01:18:56.800" style="s2">singularity attractor is in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.219" end="01:18:59.380" style="s2">maximum intelligence that&#39;s fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.800" end="01:19:00.969" style="s2">and and also I should add useful for my</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.380" end="01:19:02.800" style="s2">own for my own decision-making so thank</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.969" end="01:19:04.600" style="s2">you for that Jordan so are you operating</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.800" end="01:19:07.900" style="s2">on a kind of model are you imagining a</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.600" end="01:19:09.790" style="s2">model at the social scale that is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.900" end="01:19:11.770" style="s2">a kind of threshold model like you</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.790" end="01:19:14.469" style="s2">imagine when this stuff becomes</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.770" end="01:19:16.630" style="s2">sufficiently popular you&#39;ll see cascades</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.469" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">of this kind of behavior and and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.630" end="01:19:21.010" style="s2">would so that the face transition would</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:22.810" style="s2">be kind of slow and slow and then all of</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.010" end="01:19:24.430" style="s2">a sudden abrupt in a kind of cascade</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.810" end="01:19:28.000" style="s2">dynamic is that how you imagined it or</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.430" end="01:19:29.800" style="s2">now I I have my hot my my my Bayesian</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.000" end="01:19:31.690" style="s2">priors have their highest confidence on</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.800" end="01:19:33.430" style="s2">that model you have not catastrophic we</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.690" end="01:19:37.540" style="s2">may be in the order of like 60 63</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.430" end="01:19:39.489" style="s2">percent okay yeah and quite quite</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.540" end="01:19:41.950" style="s2">potentially quite diverse like different</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.489" end="01:19:43.510" style="s2">areas may flip at different rates so you</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.950" end="01:19:46.450" style="s2">might see a plea atrophic effect where</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.510" end="01:19:51.060" style="s2">say China may hold on to its own China</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.450" end="01:19:54.250" style="s2">Ness while other areas of the world are</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.060" end="01:19:56.950" style="s2">teleporting into this news place more</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.250" end="01:20:00.010" style="s2">rapidly right yeah and you can</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.950" end="01:20:03.160" style="s2">even subspaces within societies having</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.010" end="01:20:05.710" style="s2">their own kind of local local dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.160" end="01:20:08.530" style="s2">yeah I would expect that extra right</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.710" end="01:20:09.700" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.530" end="01:20:14.200" style="s2">that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.700" end="01:20:15.670" style="s2">and so do you have a sense for you gave</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.200" end="01:20:18.460" style="s2">very good kind of you gave a very</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.670" end="01:20:20.770" style="s2">interesting general advice for how</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.460" end="01:20:22.840" style="s2">people should think about navigating</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.770" end="01:20:23.650" style="s2">these sorts of things do you have I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.840" end="01:20:25.090" style="s2">just curious</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.650" end="01:20:29.560" style="s2">you might not but do you have any other</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.090" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">kind of thoughts on how people should</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.560" end="01:20:35.650" style="s2">decide how to kind of allocate their</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:38.230" style="s2">their risk portfolio in this regard you</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.650" end="01:20:39.550" style="s2">know and that is you know for any for</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.230" end="01:20:41.470" style="s2">any given person in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.550" end="01:20:44.980" style="s2">occupation in a particular sector in a</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.470" end="01:20:46.510" style="s2">particular country you know there are</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.980" end="01:20:50.440" style="s2">obviously different strategic variables</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.510" end="01:20:54.970" style="s2">for how much you can afford to you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.440" end="01:20:57.030" style="s2">speak the truth boldly right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.970" end="01:20:59.320" style="s2">this is something that people are really</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.030" end="01:21:01.510" style="s2">thinking through right now and people</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.320" end="01:21:03.760" style="s2">are trying to think because I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.510" end="01:21:05.950" style="s2">very clear to many people that our world</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.760" end="01:21:08.380" style="s2">our social world has become filled with</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.950" end="01:21:10.060" style="s2">all kinds of lies really I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.380" end="01:21:11.560" style="s2">just a disingenuous nostalgia</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.060" end="01:21:14.680" style="s2">contemporary kind of Western society</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.560" end="01:21:17.770" style="s2">there&#39;s so many little polite lies that</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.680" end="01:21:19.660" style="s2">I think it&#39;s quite suffocating from for</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.770" end="01:21:21.490" style="s2">many people right it&#39;s important we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.660" end="01:21:23.710" style="s2">far from the only ones I think and so a</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.490" end="01:21:26.500" style="s2">lot of people are planning you know some</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.710" end="01:21:28.690" style="s2">sort or strategizing some sort of way of</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.500" end="01:21:31.300" style="s2">navigating themselves personally to this</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.690" end="01:21:33.640" style="s2">type of other sort of yeah equilibrium</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.300" end="01:21:35.680" style="s2">but there are different in difficult</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.640" end="01:21:37.690" style="s2">kind of strategic calculations right</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.680" end="01:21:40.750" style="s2">like some people might it might be</p>

<p begin="01:21:46.090" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">time or maybe this isn&#39;t the case maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.000" end="01:21:53.110" style="s2">there is a categorical directive here</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:55.480" style="s2">where like everyone should do it to the</p>

<p begin="01:22:01.780" end="01:22:05.230" style="s2">I think you need to find a very nice</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.210" end="01:22:09.160" style="s2">categorical directive because you also</p>

<p begin="01:22:10.900" end="01:22:16.270" style="s2">on the lines of the I think it&#39;s either</p>

<p begin="01:22:16.270" end="01:22:19.780" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.650" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">and you can we can map it to a more</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.780" end="01:22:24.940" style="s2">mechanistic model if you&#39;d like but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:26.199" style="s2">something along the lines of well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.940" end="01:22:27.670" style="s2">just said I found and I&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.199" end="01:22:32.520" style="s2">found this that many other people who</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.670" end="01:22:32.520" style="s2">have spoken with have shared that</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.120" end="01:22:41.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of this was sort of unis</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.560" end="01:22:44.260" style="s2">like you you are something you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.560" end="01:22:48.520" style="s2">arbitrary and you&#39;re not generic and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.260" end="01:22:52.810" style="s2">first is a really strong sense of</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.520" end="01:22:55.830" style="s2">humility and self honesty which gives</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.810" end="01:22:59.080" style="s2">rise to the ability to then feel Yunus</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.830" end="01:23:00.520" style="s2">the most clearly and then endeavor to</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.080" end="01:23:02.340" style="s2">make the choices that are most fully in</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.520" end="01:23:05.290" style="s2">alignment with who you actually are I</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.340" end="01:23:07.060" style="s2">would say that the the biggest traps</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.290" end="01:23:08.050" style="s2">that I&#39;ve noticed are actually traps</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.060" end="01:23:11.260" style="s2">that are happening at the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.050" end="01:23:12.429" style="s2">level because right now if for example</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.260" end="01:23:15.909" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking at the cognitive level</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.429" end="01:23:19.090" style="s2">and so already this might be perceived</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.909" end="01:23:21.460" style="s2">and it might be conceived and it might</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.090" end="01:23:25.449" style="s2">be acted upon in the context of being a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.460" end="01:23:27.790" style="s2">an injunction from a top-down cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.449" end="01:23:30.909" style="s2">perspective the wishes to say an</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.790" end="01:23:34.449" style="s2">ideology and so I find many many people</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.909" end="01:23:36.040" style="s2">are caught in that so what they end up</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.449" end="01:23:39.790" style="s2">doing is they think to themselves well I</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.040" end="01:23:41.679" style="s2">ought to X Y or Z a good person would X</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.790" end="01:23:44.949" style="s2">Y or Z they&#39;re they&#39;re endeavouring to</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.679" end="01:23:48.070" style="s2">actually simulate character inside the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.949" end="01:23:49.330" style="s2">context of a schema and so that I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.070" end="01:23:50.620" style="s2">would be the first thing to break with</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.330" end="01:23:52.810" style="s2">is to actually just break with that</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.620" end="01:23:54.790" style="s2">entirely and make a distinction made</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.810" end="01:23:56.440" style="s2">between what some people would call your</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.790" end="01:23:58.810" style="s2">constructed self and your your</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.440" end="01:24:00.400" style="s2">essentially your authentic self and try</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.810" end="01:24:03.100" style="s2">to reach a place of humility and self</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.400" end="01:24:06.480" style="s2">honesty is actually able to accept the</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.100" end="01:24:10.300" style="s2">reality of your authentic self in its</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.480" end="01:24:11.409" style="s2">innocence and in its richness and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.300" end="01:24:13.060" style="s2">begin to make choices that are most</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.409" end="01:24:13.929" style="s2">fully in alignment with that authentic</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.060" end="01:24:17.380" style="s2">self because I can tell you for sure</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.929" end="01:24:19.239" style="s2">life is insanely more pleasant and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.380" end="01:24:21.520" style="s2">meaningful even when it sucks it is hard</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.239" end="01:24:24.010" style="s2">if you&#39;re making choices along on that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.520" end="01:24:25.770" style="s2">basis and then in that context then you</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.010" end="01:24:27.430" style="s2">can start doing straight</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.770" end="01:24:28.600" style="s2">because then you&#39;re actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.430" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">making strategy you&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.600" end="01:24:32.590" style="s2">choices you&#39;re making strategic choices</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:34.000" style="s2">for the right reasons but if you do</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.590" end="01:24:35.860" style="s2">strategy first you get in trouble</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.000" end="01:24:38.920" style="s2">so you&#39;re actually saying that people</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.860" end="01:24:40.300" style="s2">should in in the kind of current world</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.920" end="01:24:42.580" style="s2">that we&#39;re all trying to navigate right</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.300" end="01:24:45.760" style="s2">now you think the the optimal strategy</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.580" end="01:24:48.880" style="s2">is to first with the kind of reckless</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.760" end="01:24:52.330" style="s2">disregard to strategy first just figure</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.880" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">out who you are and do whatever you need</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.330" end="01:24:55.780" style="s2">to do following your gut to align</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:24:58.780" style="s2">yourself with in an environment that</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.780" end="01:25:01.270" style="s2">maximally kind of reflects who you are</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.780" end="01:25:04.300" style="s2">do that without strategic reflection in</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.270" end="01:25:06.730" style="s2">a first phase and then from there make</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.300" end="01:25:09.490" style="s2">your strategic wagers well let me</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.730" end="01:25:11.530" style="s2">clarify am i if what you mean by that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.490" end="01:25:14.710" style="s2">to say that people should make a bad</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.530" end="01:25:17.980" style="s2">strategic decision first which is to say</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.710" end="01:25:20.550" style="s2">you know quit the job a bit and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.980" end="01:25:22.660" style="s2">their family leave their context and go</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.550" end="01:25:25.240" style="s2">find themselves that&#39;s that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.660" end="01:25:26.890" style="s2">strategic decision in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.240" end="01:25:30.430" style="s2">them being uh find out who you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.890" end="01:25:32.310" style="s2">decision what I&#39;m saying is okay to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.430" end="01:25:35.050" style="s2">degree to which you can avoid making</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.310" end="01:25:38.710" style="s2">important decisions while getting</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.050" end="01:25:40.120" style="s2">clarity on your authentic self and</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.710" end="01:25:43.720" style="s2">separating yourself from your</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.120" end="01:25:44.800" style="s2">constructed environment and and and or</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.720" end="01:25:47.320" style="s2">your destructive environment so if</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.800" end="01:25:48.190" style="s2">you&#39;re in toxic relationships it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.320" end="01:25:50.470" style="s2">very easy okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.190" end="01:25:52.210" style="s2">exit toxic relationships if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.470" end="01:25:54.670" style="s2">job that is causing an enormous amount</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.210" end="01:25:56.200" style="s2">of stress and monopolizing all your time</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.670" end="01:25:57.670" style="s2">okay you&#39;re gonna have to get out of</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.200" end="01:26:00.040" style="s2">that so you can make kind of like this</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.670" end="01:26:02.170" style="s2">progressive low-hanging fruit that frees</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.040" end="01:26:03.550" style="s2">up more space to be able to achieve a</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.170" end="01:26:05.200" style="s2">higher level of clarity on who you are</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.550" end="01:26:07.660" style="s2">because you can get rid of nonsense that</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.200" end="01:26:08.770" style="s2">is just nonsense and then on that basis</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.660" end="01:26:10.600" style="s2">you&#39;re now able to make better choices</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.770" end="01:26:12.910" style="s2">about the next step and use that better</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.600" end="01:26:15.640" style="s2">choices about the next step step by step</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.910" end="01:26:17.260" style="s2">and work your way up but always focusing</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.640" end="01:26:18.970" style="s2">on okay what&#39;s in the way right now that</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.260" end="01:26:21.010" style="s2">I can just get out of the way am I</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.970" end="01:26:22.270" style="s2">currently addicted to crack well okay</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.010" end="01:26:23.860" style="s2">let&#39;s stop being addicted to crack</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.270" end="01:26:25.660" style="s2">because that&#39;s just an obviously good</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.860" end="01:26:27.220" style="s2">choice and on the basis it&#39;s no longer</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.660" end="01:26:28.300" style="s2">which may be hard by the way it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.220" end="01:26:30.460" style="s2">trivial to get out of it it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.300" end="01:26:32.920" style="s2">easy choice hard to do once you stopped</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.460" end="01:26:34.510" style="s2">well okay now what&#39;s the next step</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.920" end="01:26:35.650" style="s2">cool I can I can actually get a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.510" end="01:26:39.380" style="s2">that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that my</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.650" end="01:26:40.700" style="s2">aesthetic self is a is is an addict</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.380" end="01:26:41.900" style="s2">and you can you can kind of move forward</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.700" end="01:26:43.550" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind that&#39;s the way of</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.900" end="01:26:46.690" style="s2">thinking about is that you have a maybe</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.550" end="01:26:50.690" style="s2">a meta strategy which is on the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.690" end="01:26:52.100" style="s2">taking steps that is the most lucid and</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.690" end="01:26:53.600" style="s2">clear step in the orientation if</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.100" end="01:26:54.860" style="s2">increasing the quality of the basis of</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.600" end="01:26:57.980" style="s2">making choices that you were able to</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.860" end="01:27:00.410" style="s2">make and then not making more strategic</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.980" end="01:27:01.790" style="s2">commitments because the person you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.410" end="01:27:03.590" style="s2">now is shitty at doing long-term</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.790" end="01:27:04.940" style="s2">strategic commitments but the person you</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.590" end="01:27:06.710" style="s2">will be if you start doing this will get</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.940" end="01:27:08.930" style="s2">better and better at it and that as you</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.710" end="01:27:10.550" style="s2">get more clear then you&#39;re able to make</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.930" end="01:27:11.870" style="s2">better strategic choices and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.550" end="01:27:13.250" style="s2">also have better relationships with</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.870" end="01:27:14.900" style="s2">better people who can support you making</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.250" end="01:27:16.460" style="s2">those choices and you may very well find</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.900" end="01:27:18.950" style="s2">that many of the things that seem very</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.460" end="01:27:22.400" style="s2">problematic have in fact evaporated of</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.950" end="01:27:24.560" style="s2">their own accord hmm fascinating yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:25.550" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really good if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.560" end="01:27:27.580" style="s2">mind maybe we&#39;ll switch gears a little</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.550" end="01:27:29.780" style="s2">bit I&#39;ll ask you just a few more</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.580" end="01:27:31.010" style="s2">questions that may or may not be related</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.780" end="01:27:32.510" style="s2">to all this that was really useful</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.010" end="01:27:34.820" style="s2">though and then as I said it is</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.510" end="01:27:38.090" style="s2">strangely kind of personally useful so</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.820" end="01:27:39.440" style="s2">I&#39;m grateful to you Jordan do you what</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.090" end="01:27:41.210" style="s2">do you think about contemporary kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.440" end="01:27:42.560" style="s2">party politics in the West looking</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.210" end="01:27:43.670" style="s2">around at politicians and stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.560" end="01:27:45.800" style="s2">that to you is there anyone in</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.670" end="01:27:47.570" style="s2">particular that you think or project in</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.800" end="01:27:49.850" style="s2">particular that you&#39;re kind of like this</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.570" end="01:27:51.920" style="s2">that you know these people get it better</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.850" end="01:27:54.560" style="s2">than other people like a political party</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.920" end="01:27:56.000" style="s2">yeah or do you think they&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.560" end="01:27:58.090" style="s2">equally too little indifferent</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.000" end="01:28:00.170" style="s2">symmetrical ways or do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.090" end="01:28:01.760" style="s2">you know for instance like there are all</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.170" end="01:28:03.530" style="s2">these efforts to kind of what I would</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.760" end="01:28:06.140" style="s2">what I would call kind of update the</p>

<p begin="01:28:06.140" end="01:28:09.410" style="s2">know I see kind of like the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.340" end="01:28:11.150" style="s2">socialists of America and and and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.410" end="01:28:12.740" style="s2">kind of group you know the the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.150" end="01:28:15.290" style="s2">radical left wing of the Democratic</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.740" end="01:28:17.780" style="s2">Party you know there&#39;s a lot of interest</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.290" end="01:28:19.910" style="s2">right now in somehow kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.780" end="01:28:21.800" style="s2">update these mainstream modern blue</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.910" end="01:28:23.870" style="s2">church institutions in a way that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.800" end="01:28:26.540" style="s2">democratic and and even possibly</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.870" end="01:28:27.920" style="s2">socialist do you think that is promising</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.540" end="01:28:31.370" style="s2">at all or interesting at all or you</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.920" end="01:28:34.280" style="s2">think that&#39;s a blind alley yeah I would</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.370" end="01:28:36.230" style="s2">say that&#39;s a blind alley I think that</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.280" end="01:28:38.030" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some interesting stuff</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.230" end="01:28:42.020" style="s2">that happened in the five star movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.030" end="01:28:43.400" style="s2">and in the in the previous iteration of</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.020" end="01:28:46.490" style="s2">the various pirate parties that had</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.400" end="01:28:49.190" style="s2">actually a sense of coming from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.490" end="01:28:51.200" style="s2">future but I think it&#39;s a kind of a rule</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.190" end="01:28:52.480" style="s2">of thumb that to the degree to which</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.200" end="01:28:54.650" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be living in the few</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.480" end="01:28:56.750" style="s2">using frameworks that come from a very</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.650" end="01:28:58.400" style="s2">long distance in the past mm-hmm maybe</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.750" end="01:29:00.650" style="s2">you can kind of extract some essential</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.400" end="01:29:02.300" style="s2">elements from them like okay take a look</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.650" end="01:29:03.590" style="s2">at democratic socialism try to see okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.300" end="01:29:05.800" style="s2">what was the thing that actually made</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.590" end="01:29:08.390" style="s2">that interesting in its context and</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.800" end="01:29:10.130" style="s2">really really extract out the essence of</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.390" end="01:29:12.980" style="s2">it in its most pure form and it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.130" end="01:29:14.840" style="s2">now if I took that essence and redeploy</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.980" end="01:29:17.480" style="s2">it without any consideration of say</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.840" end="01:29:19.310" style="s2">mechanics mechanisms aesthetics what</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.480" end="01:29:21.290" style="s2">would that look like now okay well that</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.310" end="01:29:24.560" style="s2">might actually be very interesting but I</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.290" end="01:29:29.060" style="s2">mean imagining that you can use a 19th</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.560" end="01:29:30.860" style="s2">century steam engine to fly a Mars</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.060" end="01:29:31.370" style="s2">Lander seems like a pretty obvious bad</p>

<p begin="01:29:31.370" end="01:29:36.170" style="s2">right and what do you see Trump as kind</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.340" end="01:29:41.620" style="s2">of a similar blind alley or do you find</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.170" end="01:29:41.620" style="s2">interesting possibilities in that milieu</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.810" end="01:29:51.679" style="s2">well if this is a mapping issue if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.690" end="01:29:55.130" style="s2">identify Trump as a mapping to political</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.679" end="01:29:56.770" style="s2">party then that&#39;s a blind alley and it</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.130" end="01:29:59.300" style="s2">might be I don&#39;t really know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.770" end="01:30:01.070" style="s2">it&#39;s been I hadn&#39;t actually I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.300" end="01:30:02.510" style="s2">actually physically visited any of these</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.070" end="01:30:05.719" style="s2">particular groups I don&#39;t know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.510" end="01:30:09.530" style="s2">really happening inside if you consider</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.719" end="01:30:12.860" style="s2">Trump to be a consequence a relatively</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.530" end="01:30:14.900" style="s2">predictable consequence of the collapse</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.860" end="01:30:17.840" style="s2">of the blue church in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.900" end="01:30:22.300" style="s2">shifts that are going on then it serves</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.840" end="01:30:22.300" style="s2">sort of two distinct goods one good is</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.110" end="01:30:28.969" style="s2">shifting or ending the life of the blue</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.630" end="01:30:31.850" style="s2">church as rapidly as possible which as I</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.969" end="01:30:33.560" style="s2">said the drowning in the metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.850" end="01:30:34.580" style="s2">drowning person you need to kind of move</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.560" end="01:30:38.620" style="s2">them to a place where they&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.580" end="01:30:41.120" style="s2">flailing about and then secondarily</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.620" end="01:30:43.340" style="s2">forcing now unfortunately oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.120" end="01:30:44.840" style="s2">forcing people in a situation of</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.340" end="01:30:46.880" style="s2">distress which is problematic and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.840" end="01:30:48.980" style="s2">very problematic but forcing people to</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.880" end="01:30:51.290" style="s2">begin the process of as you say jumping</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.980" end="01:30:52.640" style="s2">ship and beginning to say okay well</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.290" end="01:30:54.920" style="s2">something new has to happen how do I</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.640" end="01:30:56.690" style="s2">begin exploring this novel space and</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.920" end="01:30:58.760" style="s2">figuring out how to do something which</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.690" end="01:31:03.440" style="s2">is at least somewhat adaptive to the</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.760" end="01:31:06.250" style="s2">context I find myself in which is it you</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.440" end="01:31:07.630" style="s2">know that&#39;s generically quite good</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.250" end="01:31:13.240" style="s2">now to the degree to which people are</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.630" end="01:31:14.710" style="s2">acting out of dis dismay they are going</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.240" end="01:31:17.470" style="s2">to the lower registers of the limbic</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.710" end="01:31:18.790" style="s2">system as they&#39;re orienting basis then</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.470" end="01:31:20.470" style="s2">the net results will be what they have</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.790" end="01:31:23.080" style="s2">always been when that is the orienting</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.470" end="01:31:27.670" style="s2">basis which is terrible</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.080" end="01:31:28.900" style="s2">so okay avoid that but well I guess</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.670" end="01:31:31.950" style="s2">that&#39;s all I have to say about that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.900" end="01:31:34.990" style="s2">okay that&#39;s what that&#39;s interesting so</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.950" end="01:31:36.730" style="s2">what am i one of my listeners who</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.990" end="01:31:39.880" style="s2">actually the person who recommended me</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.730" end="01:31:42.670" style="s2">to talk to you he told me that you once</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.880" end="01:31:43.870" style="s2">said that collapses overripe and he was</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.670" end="01:31:46.000" style="s2">very curious to know what you meant by</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.870" end="01:31:48.130" style="s2">that oh you saw that could you unpack</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.000" end="01:31:49.240" style="s2">that I can unpack it I don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.130" end="01:31:51.340" style="s2">when I said it but it sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.240" end="01:31:52.750" style="s2">something I would say okay it just goes</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.340" end="01:31:55.210" style="s2">back to that very first part of the</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.750" end="01:31:59.440" style="s2">story which is under ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.210" end="01:32:01.840" style="s2">circumstances any one of the specific</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.440" end="01:32:04.050" style="s2">areas of the world where the experts</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.840" end="01:32:07.030" style="s2">know that the risk is a lot higher than</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.050" end="01:32:10.870" style="s2">people know would be enough to deliver</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.030" end="01:32:14.170" style="s2">on some kind of crisis you know so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.870" end="01:32:16.600" style="s2">facing an n-dimensional set of crises</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.170" end="01:32:18.280" style="s2">any one of which would have been the big</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.600" end="01:32:20.740" style="s2">deal under and it sort of almost any</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.280" end="01:32:25.450" style="s2">decade over the past 200 years</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.740" end="01:32:27.370" style="s2">and so by most reckonings should have</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.450" end="01:32:31.750" style="s2">hit the fan a while ago it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.370" end="01:32:34.860" style="s2">testament to the durability of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.750" end="01:32:36.940" style="s2">social body and to the legacy</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.860" end="01:32:38.440" style="s2">effectiveness of the various blue church</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.940" end="01:32:39.880" style="s2">and other kinds of collective</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.440" end="01:32:41.670" style="s2">intelligences in the context of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.880" end="01:32:45.220" style="s2">larger scale cloak of intelligences that</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.670" end="01:32:48.940" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t happened but we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.220" end="01:32:52.630" style="s2">way out over our skis in terms of things</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.940" end="01:32:55.030" style="s2">falling apart and so and I guess a very</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.630" end="01:32:56.620" style="s2">concrete way of looking at this I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.030" end="01:32:59.140" style="s2">this is actually the very specific path</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.620" end="01:33:01.030" style="s2">that got me to this conclusion was if</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.140" end="01:33:02.710" style="s2">you just looked at the financial which</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.030" end="01:33:04.510" style="s2">is a nice kind of quantitative thing and</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.710" end="01:33:05.920" style="s2">you take a look at step by step at each</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.510" end="01:33:07.990" style="s2">of the various elements that were done</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.920" end="01:33:12.550" style="s2">to address the financial crisis in 2008</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.990" end="01:33:15.760" style="s2">and the European financial crisis which</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.550" end="01:33:18.820" style="s2">you noticed was a it was kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.760" end="01:33:20.650" style="s2">heroin for a broken leg right there was</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.820" end="01:33:22.300" style="s2">an externalization of</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.650" end="01:33:26.230" style="s2">the signalling function that we were in</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.300" end="01:33:27.700" style="s2">crisis so we traded feeling good about</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.230" end="01:33:29.080" style="s2">what was going on in exchange for</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.700" end="01:33:31.570" style="s2">actually addressing the underlying</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.080" end="01:33:33.010" style="s2">problem and this just externalized the</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.570" end="01:33:34.180" style="s2">damage in to other locations it</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.010" end="01:33:35.710" style="s2">externalized the image for example into</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.180" end="01:33:37.570" style="s2">the socio-political environment and if</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.710" end="01:33:39.790" style="s2">you want to do the tracing of brexit and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.570" end="01:33:41.740" style="s2">Trump it&#39;s not hard to say oh it happens</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.790" end="01:33:43.360" style="s2">somewhere around 2010 when it was</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.740" end="01:33:45.100" style="s2">obvious that the financial crisis have</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.360" end="01:33:49.870" style="s2">been externalized into the</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.100" end="01:33:51.280" style="s2">socio-political domain and so it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.870" end="01:33:52.540" style="s2">of like if you&#39;ve got a binding of a</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.280" end="01:33:54.730" style="s2">bunch of ropes that are round together</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.540" end="01:33:56.500" style="s2">they&#39;re holding a heavyweight and one of</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.730" end="01:33:58.450" style="s2">the ropes begins to fray well what</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.500" end="01:34:01.870" style="s2">happens is the weight shifts to other</p>

<p begin="01:34:12.370" end="01:34:15.760" style="s2">just gone up the probability of another</p>

<p begin="01:34:15.760" end="01:34:18.850" style="s2">weight shifts a little bit missed in</p>

<p begin="01:34:18.850" end="01:34:22.990" style="s2">tension but puts more weight on fewer</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.340" end="01:34:23.950" style="s2">ropes and so what ends up happening is</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.990" end="01:34:25.900" style="s2">you get some kind of you&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.950" end="01:34:27.810" style="s2">positive feedback loop where there is a</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.900" end="01:34:31.290" style="s2">finite time where the whole thing pops</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.810" end="01:34:33.910" style="s2">and the open question is okay well where</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.290" end="01:34:36.400" style="s2">how deep does the does the does the</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.910" end="01:34:39.220" style="s2">crisis go so you can have like a light</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.400" end="01:34:41.620" style="s2">weight crisis we&#39;ve had many of those</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.220" end="01:34:43.030" style="s2">and in lots of different domains you</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.620" end="01:34:45.340" style="s2">know say just say take for example the</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.030" end="01:34:48.490" style="s2">the crisis of the collapse of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.340" end="01:34:49.600" style="s2">classified ads industry and we had that</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.490" end="01:34:51.160" style="s2">was a real crisis from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.600" end="01:34:52.720" style="s2">of the classified ads people that was a</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.160" end="01:34:54.400" style="s2">terrible crisis from the point of view</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.720" end="01:34:55.570" style="s2">of the newspaper industry it was a media</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.400" end="01:34:56.680" style="s2">stood crisis from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.570" end="01:34:59.050" style="s2">the global economy it didn&#39;t matter at</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.680" end="01:35:00.400" style="s2">all right so you could have micro crisis</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.050" end="01:35:02.620" style="s2">this is really good because they clear</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.400" end="01:35:04.150" style="s2">out you know underbrush and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.620" end="01:35:06.970" style="s2">shift things forward without causing</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.150" end="01:35:09.250" style="s2">bigger things to happen but the longer</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.970" end="01:35:11.350" style="s2">the more you delay a crisis and</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.250" end="01:35:13.780" style="s2">externalize the consequences into the</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.350" end="01:35:15.400" style="s2">broader system the bigger the</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.780" end="01:35:18.010" style="s2">consequences will have to be to actually</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.400" end="01:35:19.330" style="s2">resolve the tension is pent up in it so</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.010" end="01:35:21.130" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by that is that what</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.330" end="01:35:23.170" style="s2">we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve made a choice to</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.130" end="01:35:24.910" style="s2">guarantee that things are bigger and</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.170" end="01:35:28.480" style="s2">deeper when they finally do move</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.910" end="01:35:32.230" style="s2">significantly right okay and so the</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.480" end="01:35:33.850" style="s2">current moment of a cultural political</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.230" end="01:35:34.179" style="s2">change that we&#39;re going through right</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.850" end="01:35:35.829" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:35:34.179" end="01:35:37.989" style="s2">which I you know the major reference</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.829" end="01:35:42.579" style="s2">points of which would be right brexit</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.989" end="01:35:43.989" style="s2">Trump and I think more generally the the</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.579" end="01:35:45.820" style="s2">kind of backlash against political</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.989" end="01:35:47.860" style="s2">correctness that&#39;s going on right now I</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.820" end="01:35:53.619" style="s2">see very much associated with these</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.860" end="01:35:55.150" style="s2">these major political moments if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.619" end="01:35:57.189" style="s2">fair to kind of cluster those three</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.150" end="01:35:59.800" style="s2">things as representative of a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.189" end="01:36:01.599" style="s2">contemporary you know piece of the rope</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.800" end="01:36:03.789" style="s2">breaking and you&#39;re in your metaphor</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.599" end="01:36:05.409" style="s2">yeah do you and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.789" end="01:36:07.449" style="s2">consistent with some of the stuff I read</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.409" end="01:36:09.039" style="s2">that you wrote about the rise of the the</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.449" end="01:36:10.479" style="s2">red church I think that&#39;s fairly</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.039" end="01:36:13.030" style="s2">consistent with how you see it not to</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.479" end="01:36:16.479" style="s2">read it read religion oh right sorry you</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.030" end="01:36:18.550" style="s2">read the read religion if this is an</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.479" end="01:36:21.340" style="s2">accurate way to see it would you say</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.550" end="01:36:24.280" style="s2">that this current you know moment of the</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.340" end="01:36:26.139" style="s2">of the rope coming apart is that do you</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.280" end="01:36:29.439" style="s2">see it as a mini crisis a moderate</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.139" end="01:36:32.409" style="s2">crisis or is this a kind of major world</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.439" end="01:36:34.329" style="s2">historical moment in your app if you had</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.409" end="01:36:36.099" style="s2">to guess when you say it was currently</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.329" end="01:36:37.989" style="s2">me at the political level I was saying</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.099" end="01:36:41.739" style="s2">specifically the the cluster of things</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.989" end="01:36:43.869" style="s2">that we could maybe curse it from and</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.739" end="01:36:46.119" style="s2">yeah do you know they know primarily by</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.869" end="01:36:48.999" style="s2">bread crumbs of it and the current kind</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.119" end="01:36:52.420" style="s2">of Jordan Peterson will let kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.999" end="01:36:54.880" style="s2">a little flowering of anti political</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.420" end="01:36:56.199" style="s2">correctness intellectual breathing space</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.880" end="01:36:58.630" style="s2">that&#39;s opening up in some way you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.199" end="01:37:01.389" style="s2">me also and you also and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.630" end="01:37:03.820" style="s2">people that this this kind of stuff I</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.389" end="01:37:05.679" style="s2">think it&#39;s reasonable to see it as one</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.820" end="01:37:08.349" style="s2">kind of package of the moment yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.679" end="01:37:09.909" style="s2">would say the answer is yes I would say</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.349" end="01:37:11.800" style="s2">that we&#39;re somewhere in the domain in</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.909" end="01:37:14.139" style="s2">terms of measuring a pox of world</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.800" end="01:37:16.869" style="s2">historical maybe the level of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.139" end="01:37:21.519" style="s2">Enlightenment you think that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.869" end="01:37:23.079" style="s2">is yeah and but I in the context of what</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.519" end="01:37:24.219" style="s2">I think were actually the larger story</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.079" end="01:37:28.929" style="s2">that were another thing that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.219" end="01:37:30.579" style="s2">really significant I&#39;m I&#39;m on record so</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.929" end="01:37:32.590" style="s2">it&#39;s easy for me to say I&#39;m on record as</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.579" end="01:37:36.939" style="s2">saying that I would be rather surprised</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.590" end="01:37:38.889" style="s2">if this transition was not at a 1,000</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.939" end="01:37:40.869" style="s2">year like the rise of Western</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.889" end="01:37:44.019" style="s2">civilization out of the collapse of</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.869" end="01:37:46.179" style="s2">classical civilization or at the 10,000</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.019" end="01:37:48.399" style="s2">year mark which is to say the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.179" end="01:37:52.329" style="s2">civilization out of</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.399" end="01:37:53.649" style="s2">nomadic band level constructs it seems</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.329" end="01:37:56.349" style="s2">rather obvious that has to be the case</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.649" end="01:37:58.659" style="s2">to me at least so in that context and an</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.349" end="01:38:01.300" style="s2">Enlightenment level shift coming up is</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.659" end="01:38:02.859" style="s2">kind of not that not that surprising I</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.300" end="01:38:05.579" style="s2">see what you mean okay so it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.859" end="01:38:09.039" style="s2">grand as it as it might sound at a first</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.579" end="01:38:10.659" style="s2">glance okay right yeah so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.039" end="01:38:14.079" style="s2">looking at it from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.659" end="01:38:15.399" style="s2">say 1999 it should be holy that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.079" end="01:38:17.859" style="s2">big deal like things are definitely</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.399" end="01:38:19.409" style="s2">bigger than than they were if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.859" end="01:38:22.359" style="s2">looking at from the point of say 2030</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.409" end="01:38:24.579" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a minor piece of the story</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.359" end="01:38:26.679" style="s2">from my perspective okay yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.579" end="01:38:29.439" style="s2">hopefully very importantly ya know that</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.679" end="01:38:32.889" style="s2">that the sense of scale and the and the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.439" end="01:38:34.959" style="s2">the the comparison is very relevant</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.889" end="01:38:36.729" style="s2">makes it makes a lot of sense to me so I</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.959" end="01:38:38.199" style="s2">know I&#39;m I&#39;m now gonna kind of try to</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.729" end="01:38:39.369" style="s2">wrap this up with some questions that</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.199" end="01:38:40.510" style="s2">are coming from the public chat but</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.369" end="01:38:41.320" style="s2">that&#39;s actually watching and listening</p>

<p begin="01:40:17.480" end="01:40:20.960" style="s2">knew is I know about him I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.590" end="01:40:22.970" style="s2">actually spent time with him okay and</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.960" end="01:40:25.040" style="s2">his reputation is sort of universal</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.970" end="01:40:28.190" style="s2">which is he is Sidhu he&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.040" end="01:40:29.450" style="s2">Nasim okay same reputation I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.190" end="01:40:31.460" style="s2">interacted with him very very briefly</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.450" end="01:40:36.140" style="s2">and it seems to be about right okay all</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.460" end="01:40:37.400" style="s2">right cool um I I noticed I was also</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.140" end="01:40:38.870" style="s2">looking through your YouTube channel I</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.400" end="01:40:40.670" style="s2">was curious do you have what are your</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.870" end="01:40:42.440" style="s2">plans for the YouTube channel I think</p>
<p begin="01:40:40.670" end="01:40:43.640" style="s2">you should know my streams if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.440" end="01:40:45.980" style="s2">happen it that the notion of a live</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.640" end="01:40:47.930" style="s2">stream is rather interesting</p>
<p begin="01:40:45.980" end="01:40:49.700" style="s2">I do not currently have any plans for my</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.930" end="01:40:51.110" style="s2">youtube channel I&#39;m just curious I</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.700" end="01:40:53.120" style="s2">actually never had any plans for my</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.110" end="01:40:55.400" style="s2">YouTube channel and just began doing it</p>
<p begin="01:40:53.120" end="01:40:57.020" style="s2">and responding to what was happening I</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.400" end="01:40:59.210" style="s2">noticed that I haven&#39;t shot any videos</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.020" end="01:41:00.920" style="s2">in a long time so it may be that I have</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.210" end="01:41:01.100" style="s2">lost interest in that sort of thing fair</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.920" end="01:41:02.270" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.100" end="01:41:03.620" style="s2">oh but here&#39;s something I&#39;ve learned it</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.270" end="01:41:05.570" style="s2">was I thought was very amusing it makes</p>
<p begin="01:41:03.620" end="01:41:06.880" style="s2">sense retroactively but it appears that</p>
<p begin="01:41:05.570" end="01:41:09.800" style="s2">at least some fraction of the population</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.880" end="01:41:11.960" style="s2">really deeply believes that the only</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.800" end="01:41:15.440" style="s2">reason to create a YouTube channel is to</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.960" end="01:41:17.300" style="s2">get on the Joe Rogan show why do how did</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.440" end="01:41:19.670" style="s2">you learn that what do you mean a number</p>
<p begin="01:41:17.300" end="01:41:23.300" style="s2">of comments have taken it is almost</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.670" end="01:41:25.910" style="s2">axiomatic that it confusing as to well</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.300" end="01:41:27.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve created a YouTube channel and it</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.910" end="01:41:29.510" style="s2">seems to have some high quality content</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.320" end="01:41:31.100" style="s2">it is confusing as to why you&#39;re not on</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.510" end="01:41:33.170" style="s2">the Joe Rogan show like obviously that</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.100" end="01:41:34.520" style="s2">must be why you did it and it seems like</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.170" end="01:41:37.370" style="s2">you should be able to so why hasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.520" end="01:41:41.090" style="s2">happened I can say categorically that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.370" end="01:41:42.680" style="s2">did not and I have never intended to get</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.090" end="01:41:44.510" style="s2">on the Joe Rogan show or the Dave Rubin</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.680" end="01:41:49.160" style="s2">show that both gentlemen seem very</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.510" end="01:41:51.860" style="s2">pleasant and I certainly would not well</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.160" end="01:41:53.090" style="s2">no actually after listening I got</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.860" end="01:41:56.960" style="s2">pointed to the Elan musk interview with</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.090" end="01:41:58.790" style="s2">Joe Rogan and after that I would be I</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.960" end="01:42:01.820" style="s2">would I would participate in a</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.790" end="01:42:03.260" style="s2">conversation with Joe but I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.820" end="01:42:04.400" style="s2">any particular aspirations to that kind</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.260" end="01:42:06.470" style="s2">of thing so I created the YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:42:04.400" end="01:42:08.360" style="s2">channel really honestly really because I</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.470" end="01:42:10.970" style="s2">kept getting requests from people to</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.360" end="01:42:12.290" style="s2">explain certain things to them and so I</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.970" end="01:42:13.550" style="s2">figured to be more efficient if I just</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.290" end="01:42:14.810" style="s2">kind of like explained it a general</p>
<p begin="01:42:13.550" end="01:42:16.480" style="s2">purpose format I could just send them</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.810" end="01:42:18.190" style="s2">the line</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.480" end="01:42:21.730" style="s2">and it has definitely served that</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.190" end="01:42:23.770" style="s2">purpose okay yeah fair enough yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.730" end="01:42:26.380" style="s2">people really don&#39;t understand the magic</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.770" end="01:42:27.910" style="s2">of contemporary communication technology</p>
<p begin="01:42:26.380" end="01:42:29.230" style="s2">that people are constantly missing</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.910" end="01:42:31.449" style="s2">missing the point I think like people</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.230" end="01:42:32.920" style="s2">are always imagining if you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.449" end="01:42:34.360" style="s2">YouTube or you want to do any of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:32.920" end="01:42:35.830" style="s2">write a blog or whatever people are</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.360" end="01:42:39.400" style="s2">always imagining there has to be some</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.830" end="01:42:41.949" style="s2">sort of like like ulterior motive that</p>
<p begin="01:42:39.400" end="01:42:43.239" style="s2">has something to do with like well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.949" end="01:42:44.650" style="s2">like always referring back to the blue</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.239" end="01:42:46.480" style="s2">church right it&#39;s always this people</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.650" end="01:42:50.199" style="s2">always have this deeply ingrained</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.480" end="01:42:52.540" style="s2">tendency to refer themselves back to</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.199" end="01:42:54.760" style="s2">whatever represents kind of like power</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.540" end="01:42:57.370" style="s2">at the center of the spectacle but you</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.760" end="01:43:00.699" style="s2">know where attention is where other</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.370" end="01:43:02.739" style="s2">people are looking but the I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.699" end="01:43:04.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s missing precisely the point</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.739" end="01:43:07.300" style="s2">which is precisely that now is the time</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.660" end="01:43:09.370" style="s2">to disconnect your attention from where</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.300" end="01:43:11.380" style="s2">everyone else is looking and simply look</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.370" end="01:43:12.640" style="s2">around you to whatever is most</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.380" end="01:43:15.010" style="s2">immediately interesting and attractive</p>
<p begin="01:43:12.640" end="01:43:16.000" style="s2">and valuable to you that&#39;s immediately</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.010" end="01:43:18.370" style="s2">available to you because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.000" end="01:43:19.989" style="s2">millions of people and ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.370" end="01:43:22.030" style="s2">projects and texts and and and</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.989" end="01:43:23.890" style="s2">everything that&#39;s actually within your</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.030" end="01:43:26.110" style="s2">reach that you can get to work on</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.890" end="01:43:28.060" style="s2">immediately and drive after it and do</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.110" end="01:43:29.739" style="s2">that and before you know it you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.060" end="01:43:31.030" style="s2">all of these interesting vectors and</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.739" end="01:43:32.710" style="s2">before you know it you&#39;re the next</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.030" end="01:43:33.640" style="s2"> Joe Rogan and he&#39;s an old man and</p>
<p begin="01:43:32.710" end="01:43:36.610" style="s2">no one cares about him anymore</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.640" end="01:43:39.190" style="s2">yeah yes that&#39;s very well said I agree</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.610" end="01:43:42.340" style="s2">yeah so I mean I mean I think um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:39.190" end="01:43:43.210" style="s2">I&#39;m like I think it&#39;s a shame because we</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.340" end="01:43:45.699" style="s2">were talking before about like</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.210" end="01:43:47.050" style="s2">evolutionary traps and we&#39;re just traps</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.699" end="01:43:48.460" style="s2">and pitfalls in particularly and in</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.050" end="01:43:49.180" style="s2">general you were talking about at a</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.460" end="01:43:51.310" style="s2">certain point in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.180" end="01:43:52.989" style="s2">previously and I think this is this is a</p>
<p begin="01:43:51.310" end="01:43:54.160" style="s2">real major one and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.989" end="01:43:56.230" style="s2">you&#39;re familiar with the kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.160" end="01:43:57.850" style="s2">left-wing critiques of what they call</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.230" end="01:43:59.860" style="s2">the Society of the spectacle you know</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.850" end="01:44:02.739" style="s2">it&#39;s this kind of like this was it guys</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.860" end="01:44:05.350" style="s2">that 1970s yeah exactly the you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:02.739" end="01:44:08.739" style="s2">1960 shiness French French people</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.350" end="01:44:09.160" style="s2">basically a kind of post-divorce what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.739" end="01:44:11.260" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.160" end="01:44:13.390" style="s2">Guiteau barred yes exactly Ghita bore</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.260" end="01:44:14.949" style="s2">yeah the situation half and I read that</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.390" end="01:44:17.230" style="s2">back in the day yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.949" end="01:44:18.880" style="s2">um but the one kernel that I really took</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.230" end="01:44:20.650" style="s2">from all of that that I think you see</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.880" end="01:44:23.080" style="s2">very clearly in this conversation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:20.650" end="01:44:26.590" style="s2">having right now which is people do</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.080" end="01:44:28.780" style="s2">really just overly refer themselves back</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.590" end="01:44:31.210" style="s2">to to what they imagine other people</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.780" end="01:44:33.940" style="s2">our thinking and what they care about</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.210" end="01:44:35.470" style="s2">and it really prevents them from doing a</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.940" end="01:44:39.100" style="s2">lot of so much that they could do</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.470" end="01:44:41.500" style="s2">immediately yeah yeah and it kind of</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.100" end="01:44:43.150" style="s2">sucks too it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.500" end="01:44:44.410" style="s2">feeding yourself you&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.150" end="01:44:45.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not getting this it&#39;s funny I can</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.410" end="01:44:47.800" style="s2">imagine so like I just like to do it</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.700" end="01:44:49.210" style="s2">very simple imagine if you chose to eat</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.800" end="01:44:50.730" style="s2">based upon what you think you thought</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.210" end="01:44:54.000" style="s2">other people wanted to eat</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.730" end="01:44:56.110" style="s2">yes it&#39;s an obviously silly thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.000" end="01:44:58.570" style="s2">but I get it I mean we&#39;ve been trained</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.110" end="01:44:59.290" style="s2">from child well not birth but shortly</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.570" end="01:45:05.080" style="s2">after birth</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.290" end="01:45:07.570" style="s2">to be unbelievably tuned to this notion</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.080" end="01:45:11.020" style="s2">of broadcast asymmetric collective</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.570" end="01:45:11.890" style="s2">attention so it&#39;s visceral it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.020" end="01:45:13.420" style="s2">train yourself you have to be conscious</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.890" end="01:45:15.370" style="s2">you have to consciously train yourself</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.420" end="01:45:17.050" style="s2">off of it you can&#39;t just or you might</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.370" end="01:45:19.750" style="s2">just get lucky and just have not been on</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.050" end="01:45:20.980" style="s2">that train but it&#39;s pretty rare yeah for</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.750" end="01:45:23.080" style="s2">sure well I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.980" end="01:45:24.550" style="s2">things are becoming so Inc so flattened</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.080" end="01:45:26.260" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna continue becoming so</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.550" end="01:45:28.360" style="s2">flattened that I think you&#39;ll see more</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.260" end="01:45:30.790" style="s2">and more people doing all kinds of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.360" end="01:45:33.280" style="s2">like this just for their own sustenance</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.790" end="01:45:35.170" style="s2">you know for the immediate intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.280" end="01:45:37.690" style="s2">value that it brings to their life and</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.170" end="01:45:39.730" style="s2">before you know it you know they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.690" end="01:45:43.480" style="s2">in some sense the Joe Rogan like someone</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.730" end="01:45:45.700" style="s2">like Joe Rogan is a kind of what happens</p>

<p begin="01:45:48.160" end="01:45:52.420" style="s2">have like one Walter Cronkite right and</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.900" end="01:45:57.160" style="s2">then right that gets decimated into like</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.420" end="01:45:58.840" style="s2">you know mm Walter comic rights that are</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.160" end="01:46:00.130" style="s2">at a little bit of a lower level but</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.840" end="01:46:02.890" style="s2">these things happen over time right so</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.130" end="01:46:04.870" style="s2">you know Jude like Joe Rogan is a Walter</p>
<p begin="01:46:02.890" end="01:46:07.570" style="s2">Cronkite for a particular slice of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.870" end="01:46:09.610" style="s2">personality right uh profiles of the</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.570" end="01:46:11.440" style="s2">population and then all of the other</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.610" end="01:46:13.900" style="s2">people are kind of at his level of Fame</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.440" end="01:46:15.880" style="s2">or attention are just a bunch of mini</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.900" end="01:46:17.740" style="s2">Cronkite&#39;s but every passing year the</p>

<p begin="01:46:17.740" end="01:46:21.670" style="s2">get you know increased at a lower and</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.140" end="01:46:24.520" style="s2">lower flatter level I think and I think</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.670" end="01:46:26.800" style="s2">where it&#39;s ultimately going is people</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.520" end="01:46:28.450" style="s2">are going to be doing this just for</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.800" end="01:46:31.510" style="s2">their own purposes in their own groups</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.450" end="01:46:33.220" style="s2">for its own intrinsic benefits and</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.510" end="01:46:35.230" style="s2">values and it&#39;s not going to be this</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.220" end="01:46:37.150" style="s2">like media fame game where people are</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.230" end="01:46:38.590" style="s2">like right now people think about these</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.150" end="01:46:40.060" style="s2">things that&#39;s like oh who&#39;s got more</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.590" end="01:46:41.770" style="s2">followers who&#39;s like making more money</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.060" end="01:46:43.450" style="s2">off of it who&#39;s who&#39;s winning the</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.770" end="01:46:45.520" style="s2">who&#39;s at the top of the pyramid but</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.450" end="01:46:46.900" style="s2">people like precisely what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.520" end="01:46:49.270" style="s2">about is that that pyramid is going away</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.900" end="01:46:51.940" style="s2">it&#39;s rapidly being flattened in every</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.270" end="01:46:53.860" style="s2">passing year who has the most followers</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.940" end="01:46:56.800" style="s2">matters less and less and what really</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.860" end="01:46:59.710" style="s2">matters is like how effective is the</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.800" end="01:47:01.930" style="s2">intelligence community or structure or</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.710" end="01:47:03.400" style="s2">institution that you have operating</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.930" end="01:47:04.900" style="s2">around you just for its own intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.400" end="01:47:06.190" style="s2">purposes that&#39;s that&#39;s how I see it I</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.900" end="01:47:08.110" style="s2">think that&#39;s consistent with what with</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.190" end="01:47:09.640" style="s2">your view right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.110" end="01:47:13.570" style="s2">yes and I&#39;m the only thing I would say</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.640" end="01:47:16.480" style="s2">is that it&#39;s to me there&#39;s kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.570" end="01:47:17.860" style="s2">inside and outside correlation one is</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.480" end="01:47:19.480" style="s2">from the inside perspective that is</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.860" end="01:47:21.880" style="s2">actually the thing that feels the best</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.480" end="01:47:23.770" style="s2">mmm yeah there&#39;s like the distinction</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.880" end="01:47:26.080" style="s2">between having 10,000 Facebook friends</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.770" end="01:47:29.500" style="s2">and having 10 friends yeah</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.080" end="01:47:31.690" style="s2">but second is again I strongly believe</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.500" end="01:47:33.760" style="s2">that this also tends to be is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.690" end="01:47:36.210" style="s2">isomorphic with the collective</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.760" end="01:47:39.640" style="s2">intelligence topology that is maximum</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.210" end="01:47:41.740" style="s2">maximally intelligent yes so it&#39;s fun</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.640" end="01:47:46.210" style="s2">like it&#39;s actually by playing this new</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.740" end="01:47:48.160" style="s2">game this game be you simultaneously get</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.210" end="01:47:50.560" style="s2">to live the most fulfilling and</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.160" end="01:47:52.990" style="s2">meaningful life and also happen to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.560" end="01:47:55.540" style="s2">perfectly deployed your personal energy</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.990" end="01:47:58.060" style="s2">is fully participating in that which</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.540" end="01:48:00.580" style="s2">will ultimately would ultimately be the</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.060" end="01:48:02.230" style="s2">best possible way of constructing of</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.580" end="01:48:03.820" style="s2">collective intelligence just say the the</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.230" end="01:48:06.070" style="s2">thing that is the maximum the</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.820" end="01:48:09.430" style="s2">intelligent place to be right I like</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.070" end="01:48:10.630" style="s2">that yeah absolutely yeah um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.430" end="01:48:12.010" style="s2">want to keep you too long I know we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.630" end="01:48:13.300" style="s2">been talking for quite a while maybe if</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.010" end="01:48:14.620" style="s2">it&#39;s okay with you all ask you just one</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.300" end="01:48:16.800" style="s2">more question there&#39;s that cool it</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.620" end="01:48:19.540" style="s2">sounds perfect yeah all right great um</p>
<p begin="01:48:16.800" end="01:48:21.880" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll make this last question about</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.540" end="01:48:23.290" style="s2">blockchain I think from what I gather</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.880" end="01:48:28.210" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re rather bullish on</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.290" end="01:48:28.510" style="s2">blockchain do you see it as how should I</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.210" end="01:48:34.000" style="s2">put this</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.510" end="01:48:37.180" style="s2">um you you do you think people kind of</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.000" end="01:48:40.200" style="s2">underestimate its significance or do you</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.180" end="01:48:46.240" style="s2">think people kind of overestimate its</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.200" end="01:48:47.500" style="s2">significance hmm gosh or just you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:46.240" end="01:48:48.910" style="s2">have I mean you can just tell me why you</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.500" end="01:48:51.310" style="s2">think blockchain is interesting and I</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.910" end="01:48:53.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know I I I want to give you a good</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.310" end="01:48:54.910" style="s2">answer but it&#39;s not decidedly</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.170" end="01:48:57.940" style="s2">non-trivial so</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.910" end="01:49:00.880" style="s2">to do this right we have to actually</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.940" end="01:49:03.970" style="s2">build some constructs okay so the first</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.880" end="01:49:05.380" style="s2">construct is something called C Gnaeus C</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.970" end="01:49:07.060" style="s2">nice it&#39;s kind of the genius of a scene</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.380" end="01:49:08.500" style="s2">or it&#39;s the the emergence of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.060" end="01:49:10.840" style="s2">collective intelligence around some</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.500" end="01:49:13.120" style="s2">novel capacity or some novel attractor</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.840" end="01:49:14.920" style="s2">so punk rock has a scene II as quantum</p>
<p begin="01:49:13.120" end="01:49:16.630" style="s2">mechanics is a see me as the emergent PC</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.920" end="01:49:17.890" style="s2">was a scene yes the organic food</p>
<p begin="01:49:16.630" end="01:49:19.960" style="s2">movement see Gnaeus like fill in the</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.890" end="01:49:21.700" style="s2">blank there&#39;s lots and lots of these the</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.960" end="01:49:23.440" style="s2">second is a self-organizing collective</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.700" end="01:49:25.840" style="s2">intelligence so this is a particular</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.440" end="01:49:27.550" style="s2">subset of the C Gnaeus where the</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.840" end="01:49:29.880" style="s2">characteristics of the seniors give rise</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.550" end="01:49:32.740" style="s2">to a series of feedback loops whereby</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.880" end="01:49:36.760" style="s2">the the collective intelligence has the</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.740" end="01:49:38.920" style="s2">capacity to maintain or increase its its</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.760" end="01:49:43.300" style="s2">capacities with what it is by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.920" end="01:49:44.560" style="s2">what it is so punk rock had less of a</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.300" end="01:49:47.170" style="s2">self-organizing collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.560" end="01:49:49.960" style="s2">character then say the personal computer</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.170" end="01:49:52.480" style="s2">you know so more people who participated</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.960" end="01:49:54.220" style="s2">in the PC universe increase the demand</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.480" end="01:49:55.600" style="s2">for PCs which increase the economic</p>
<p begin="01:49:54.220" end="01:49:57.310" style="s2">flows which increase more people who are</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.600" end="01:49:59.590" style="s2">to participate and sort of caused that</p>
<p begin="01:49:57.310" end="01:50:01.480" style="s2">collective intelligence to expand it had</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.590" end="01:50:03.250" style="s2">a very flat capacity get only do certain</p>
<p begin="01:50:01.480" end="01:50:05.950" style="s2">things but you know we&#39;re doing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.250" end="01:50:07.840" style="s2">doing because that happened so within</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.950" end="01:50:10.500" style="s2">that context when we say blockchain I</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.840" end="01:50:14.380" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t mean the technological</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.500" end="01:50:16.660" style="s2">innovation of Satoshi that was able to</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.380" end="01:50:19.870" style="s2">resolve produce a solution to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.660" end="01:50:22.300" style="s2">Byzantine generals problem I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.870" end="01:50:25.240" style="s2">really necessarily refer to the C Gnaeus</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.300" end="01:50:27.400" style="s2">that that is an aspect up right so if I</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.240" end="01:50:30.100" style="s2">think of oh use punk rock as an example</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.400" end="01:50:35.650" style="s2">we might say that it&#39;s a Bitcoin</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.100" end="01:50:39.490" style="s2">represents I don&#39;t know the clash or the</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.650" end="01:50:41.080" style="s2">Sex Pistols and theory am representing</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.490" end="01:50:43.450" style="s2">the Ramones or something like that right</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.080" end="01:50:45.310" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got a very different flavor of</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.450" end="01:50:48.490" style="s2">something which is clearly part of the</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.310" end="01:50:51.340" style="s2">larger milieu and is currently operating</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.490" end="01:50:53.940" style="s2">under C Gnaeus rules in this case both</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.340" end="01:50:55.930" style="s2">Bitcoin and aetherium represent a in</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.940" end="01:50:57.370" style="s2">internally they&#39;re self organizing</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.930" end="01:51:00.940" style="s2">collective intelligences in the broader</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.370" end="01:51:05.320" style="s2">context of the scene is so what I am</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.940" end="01:51:08.230" style="s2">bullish on is that the the scene yes of</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.320" end="01:51:11.140" style="s2">the blockchain sometimes I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.230" end="01:51:12.790" style="s2">called cryptocurrency sometimes called</p>

<p begin="01:51:25.090" end="01:51:31.960" style="s2">operating in most notably I&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="01:51:30.640" end="01:51:34.450" style="s2">give some caveats but me just cut the</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.960" end="01:51:37.840" style="s2">park is good the the optimistic part is</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.450" end="01:51:40.600" style="s2">that it it still attaches a premium to</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.840" end="01:51:42.960" style="s2">people who are able to think clearly</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.600" end="01:51:45.489" style="s2">about very complicated things and</p>

<p begin="01:52:06.820" end="01:52:12.130" style="s2">the struggle is on to see whether or not</p>

<p begin="01:52:24.340" end="01:52:31.750" style="s2">miasma of marketing</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.400" end="01:52:33.540" style="s2">and financial gerrymandering so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.750" end="01:52:35.770" style="s2">kind of it&#39;s and it&#39;s I&#39;d say maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.540" end="01:52:38.410" style="s2">early teenage stage it&#39;s a tween right</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.770" end="01:52:40.360" style="s2">now it&#39;s about ten or eleven okay very</p>

<p begin="01:52:40.360" end="01:52:47.380" style="s2">you what but the B potential that if I</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.340" end="01:52:51.100" style="s2">take for example the number of people</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.380" end="01:52:53.489" style="s2">who are interested in and able to think</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.100" end="01:52:55.750" style="s2">about the early part of our conversation</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.489" end="01:52:59.980" style="s2">you know the proposition of what would</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.750" end="01:53:02.100" style="s2">be the characteristics of a maximally</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.980" end="01:53:03.940" style="s2">intelligent collective intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:53:02.100" end="01:53:07.150" style="s2">why would that even be an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.940" end="01:53:10.180" style="s2">question to ask and and then I look at</p>
<p begin="01:53:07.150" end="01:53:11.980" style="s2">the population of that the portion of</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.180" end="01:53:13.780" style="s2">that population that has some of their</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.980" end="01:53:17.440" style="s2">attention in the blockchain space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.780" end="01:53:19.150" style="s2">actually relatively high so two degree</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.440" end="01:53:21.460" style="s2">to which the blockchain space is able to</p>
<p begin="01:53:19.150" end="01:53:21.650" style="s2">build institutional frameworks to pull</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.460" end="01:53:23.540" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:53:21.650" end="01:53:27.650" style="s2">against parasites and artists</p>
<p begin="01:53:23.540" end="01:53:28.550" style="s2">and select for clear honest thinking</p>
<p begin="01:53:27.650" end="01:53:30.410" style="s2">kind of like to say they wait</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.550" end="01:53:31.970" style="s2">mathematics was able to do that or</p>
<p begin="01:53:30.410" end="01:53:33.650" style="s2">science which differentiated science for</p>
<p begin="01:53:31.970" end="01:53:35.120" style="s2">magic in the beginning was its ability</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.650" end="01:53:36.830" style="s2">to build those kinds of institutional</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.120" end="01:53:38.360" style="s2">structures and say okay this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.830" end="01:53:40.100" style="s2">pseudoscience and and this is</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.360" end="01:53:42.230" style="s2">in fact clear thinking and we have ways</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.100" end="01:53:45.050" style="s2">of separating those things somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.230" end="01:53:47.450" style="s2">rigorously not perfectly but a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.050" end="01:53:49.430" style="s2">lot better in Prior centuries then the</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.450" end="01:53:52.640" style="s2">blockchain space as a senior&#39;s is able</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.430" end="01:53:54.350" style="s2">to we&#39;ll be able to realize the</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.640" end="01:53:56.780" style="s2">potential that lives in the sea Gnaeus</p>
<p begin="01:53:54.350" end="01:54:00.350" style="s2">and that potential is extremely large</p>
<p begin="01:53:56.780" end="01:54:04.760" style="s2">and it is entirely possible that we</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.350" end="01:54:08.060" style="s2">could see a of 75 percent of the global</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.760" end="01:54:13.100" style="s2">economy into that sea Gnaeus in a decade</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.060" end="01:54:15.290" style="s2">if it had it together likely it won&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.100" end="01:54:17.720" style="s2">may see we may see zero may just die</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.290" end="01:54:18.710" style="s2">that&#39;s unlikely it&#39;s just too much</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.720" end="01:54:21.320" style="s2">potential and there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.710" end="01:54:24.500" style="s2">dysfunction the legacy technology</p>
<p begin="01:54:21.320" end="01:54:26.000" style="s2">industry but the potential is is very</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.500" end="01:54:27.920" style="s2">very high and it&#39;s still quite right</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.000" end="01:54:29.990" style="s2">like it&#39;s too early to tell exactly</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.920" end="01:54:31.910" style="s2">whether or not these these subgroups</p>
<p begin="01:54:29.990" end="01:54:33.710" style="s2">will figure it out and it doesn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.910" end="01:54:35.690" style="s2">many it could be like as little as 10</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.710" end="01:54:37.970" style="s2">people if they were able to really</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.690" end="01:54:39.500" style="s2">really get a clean structure that was</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.970" end="01:54:41.210" style="s2">able to be very effective while</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.500" end="01:54:43.760" style="s2">maintaining a high integrity</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.210" end="01:54:45.020" style="s2">institutional framework everybody else</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.760" end="01:54:49.580" style="s2">would begin to emulate that and they</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.020" end="01:54:52.430" style="s2">would grow organically into a much more</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.580" end="01:54:53.960" style="s2">powerful collaborative space ok right</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.430" end="01:54:57.110" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting is there a</p>
<p begin="01:54:53.960" end="01:54:59.570" style="s2">particular kind of social application or</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.110" end="01:55:01.430" style="s2">kind of social engineering solution that</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.570" end="01:55:03.650" style="s2">you think blockchain could possibly</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.430" end="01:55:04.880" style="s2">provide that you&#39;re personally most kind</p>
<p begin="01:55:03.650" end="01:55:11.000" style="s2">of excited about or paying most</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.880" end="01:55:16.460" style="s2">attention to yeah the one that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.000" end="01:55:19.870" style="s2">actually most excited about is the a new</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.460" end="01:55:19.870" style="s2">form so Amparo say this right</p>
<p begin="01:55:21.280" end="01:55:28.270" style="s2">so there&#39;s the yellow pages and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.080" end="01:55:31.960" style="s2">Google there&#39;s the fleamarket in a ZB</p>
<p begin="01:55:28.270" end="01:55:36.110" style="s2">there&#39;s first Barnes and Noble and then</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.960" end="01:55:40.970" style="s2">Walmart and there&#39;s Amazon okay there is</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.110" end="01:55:42.080" style="s2">the city and there&#39;s X X is the thing</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.970" end="01:55:44.030" style="s2">that I&#39;m most excited about that the</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.080" end="01:55:47.450" style="s2">blockchain as a senior&#39;s can give rise</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.030" end="01:55:49.520" style="s2">to hmm wow that&#39;s interesting so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.450" end="01:55:51.560" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of so much of a question mark</p>
<p begin="01:55:49.520" end="01:55:54.380" style="s2">that you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s you would</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.560" end="01:55:56.210" style="s2">call it I mean what I would call it is</p>
<p begin="01:55:54.380" end="01:55:57.590" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be bad because I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.210" end="01:56:00.680" style="s2">marketing guy so I can&#39;t name things</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.590" end="01:56:04.280" style="s2">well but it will be in relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.680" end="01:56:08.330" style="s2">the way that we go about organizing our</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.280" end="01:56:13.250" style="s2">ways of living with each other in space</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.330" end="01:56:14.810" style="s2">you context right that gives rise to the</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.250" end="01:56:17.420" style="s2">highest quality ways that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.810" end="01:56:19.430" style="s2">coordinate our activities together in</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.420" end="01:56:21.740" style="s2">the generative direction all right so</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.430" end="01:56:26.660" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna actually resolve the question</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.740" end="01:56:32.420" style="s2">of how we live and how we develop how we</p>
<p begin="01:56:26.660" end="01:56:34.550" style="s2">do hmm that&#39;s very interesting but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.420" end="01:56:36.380" style="s2">very interesting I mean there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.550" end="01:56:37.730" style="s2">more I&#39;d love to talk about but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.380" end="01:56:39.050" style="s2">want to overtax you and we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.730" end="01:56:40.820" style="s2">good two hours man so this has been</p>
<p begin="01:56:39.050" end="01:56:43.220" style="s2">really interesting and really edifying</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.820" end="01:56:45.230" style="s2">and it&#39;s been fun too so I&#39;m inclined to</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.220" end="01:56:47.750" style="s2">let you off the hook now I think that</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.230" end="01:56:49.340" style="s2">sounds good to you yeah thank you it has</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.750" end="01:56:51.310" style="s2">been a while I can&#39;t feel my lower back</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.340" end="01:56:53.750" style="s2">is definitely needing some stretching</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.310" end="01:56:57.260" style="s2">well uh thank you I enjoyed this</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.750" end="01:56:58.640" style="s2">conversation and I I think I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.260" end="01:57:01.550" style="s2">chewing on some of the questions and</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.640" end="01:57:03.500" style="s2">some of the ideas for a while and I hope</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.550" end="01:57:05.480" style="s2">that you and the folks who choose to</p>
<p begin="01:57:03.500" end="01:57:05.750" style="s2">watch it felt like their time was well</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.480" end="01:57:07.460" style="s2">spent</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.750" end="01:57:08.900" style="s2">yeah the chat the people in the chat</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.460" end="01:57:10.460" style="s2">seem to be enjoying it in fact a few</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.900" end="01:57:12.470" style="s2">people said a few people watching right</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.460" end="01:57:14.420" style="s2">now are I think big fans of yours and</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.470" end="01:57:16.430" style="s2">they a few people said that they feel</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.420" end="01:57:17.870" style="s2">like you you kind of broke some ground</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.430" end="01:57:19.730" style="s2">in this conversation like saying some</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.870" end="01:57:22.460" style="s2">things they never saw you right before</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.730" end="01:57:23.480" style="s2">or say before I don&#39;t know if you if you</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.460" end="01:57:25.730" style="s2">would agree with that but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.480" end="01:57:27.980" style="s2">interesting though it was shocking if it</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.730" end="01:57:30.320" style="s2">weren&#39;t the case that&#39;s always a good</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.980" end="01:57:32.960" style="s2">time that&#39;s that&#39;s maybe one of the best</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.320" end="01:57:34.250" style="s2">measures I think of a successful</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.960" end="01:57:36.230" style="s2">conversation at least a</p>
