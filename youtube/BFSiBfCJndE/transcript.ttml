<p begin="00:00:35.100" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">need to think outside of the box and</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">instead of demanding our governments</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">create citizen assemblies that then they</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.119" end="00:01:10.170" style="s2">to do that is a technological system</p>
