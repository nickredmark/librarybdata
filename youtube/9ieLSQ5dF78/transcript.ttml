<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">i attended some bilateral stem</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">stimulation of a past</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">meditation last week and noticed a time</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:46.720" style="s2">dilation type effect</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">is there a term for this in any buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.720" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">school or sec</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">uh do you mean for the time dilation</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:53.919" style="s2">effect not</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.919" end="00:18:55.679" style="s2">technical term for this that i&#39;m aware</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.679" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean very much because</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.039" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">there are a lot of sex there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">different lineages</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">um i do know that prime dilation</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.000" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">is a standard feature of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">flow and uh i&#39;ve argued with leo ferraro</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">and area bennett uh that flow is an</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">insight cascade and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">evidence that what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">um in insight is a radical</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">and rapid restructuring of uh neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">pattern</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">of firing between the two hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.160" end="00:19:32.799" style="s2">and that makes sense uh that that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">bring with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.799" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">what we know in the flow state you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">one of the widely reported effects in</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">flow states</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">and then the overlapping mystical states</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">um effects that happen i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">this has to do with the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">in insight but magnified uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.960" style="s2">what&#39;s what you consider relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">salient what&#39;s foregrounded and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.960" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">backgrounded</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">is rapidly being restructured and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">altered um</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">and so uh psychological time</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">even psychological space when you do</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:12.240" style="s2">some work on mental imagery</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">uh seems to be measured uh not the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.240" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">we measure measure sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">just sort of i don&#39;t know what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">physical time uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">you know standard units of measurement</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">psychological time is measured in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">increments of meaning and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:27.520" style="s2">getting massive restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.440" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">it&#39;s going to alter your sense of time</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.520" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">significantly that&#39;s what i suspect</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">is happening so i think the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">dilation uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:37.600" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">effect probably a side effect i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">know if it itself is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">although it has the reflective</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">adaptation of getting you to step aside</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.640" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">from sort of your normal perspective to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:55.120" style="s2">do a bit of the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about when we do uh the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.120" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">wisdom of my patient</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">but i suspect that um the real</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">adaptive benefits are from</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">beautifully as it always does</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">how there&#39;s a degree of of silence</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">that plays an important role it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">silence as the privation of speech</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">it is the silence that takes you into</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">that which makes all speech possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">and this is also something that&#39;s spoken</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">of in the neoplatonic christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:55.039" style="s2">which we&#39;ll talk about when we get into</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">the wisdom of hypatia which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.039" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">when you get what whatever presencing is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.880" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">that coming from</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">you know from the invisible into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">indivisible so from deep sorry from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">invisible to the visible</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">from the indeterminate to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">determinant that realization</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">of intelligibility whatever that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:18.559" style="s2">coming from is not itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">intelligible there&#39;s no logos to it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.559" end="00:23:22.159" style="s2">so it itself cannot be put into speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.159" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">it is the grounding of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">intelligibility the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.240" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">of realness and realization upon which</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">speech is grounded and depends</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">and so therefore as we as our as we</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">conform</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">to that sourcing of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.640" style="s2">we move into its silence but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:44.559" style="s2">different it&#39;s not the silence that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.640" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">the privation of speech as i said</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.559" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">it is the silence that is exactly taking</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">us into what ground speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">and if you&#39;ll allow me without something</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">too meta what grounds the grounding of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">all speech and thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">um and this um is considered</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">to be something sacred uh because</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">of it it is the source of um</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.960" end="00:24:08.640" style="s2">whatever sense we can make whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">meaning we can make</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.640" end="00:24:12.400" style="s2">um and it is also therefore deeply</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">aligned with what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.400" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">most real and uh the neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">tradition argues that it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">the place the asymptote at the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">where the true the good and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">beautiful converge in their common</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:33.600" style="s2">origin and grounding so i think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">insofar as the lectio puts us</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.600" end="00:24:37.200" style="s2">in touch with that trajectory of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">transframing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.200" end="00:24:44.960" style="s2">that active ascension</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">in observation and in awareness</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.960" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">um is what i</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">i was touching upon in that instance of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:58.480" style="s2">lexia so i hope that was helpful to you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">well so sorry today was uh somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">metaphysical</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">signed very metaphysical</p>
