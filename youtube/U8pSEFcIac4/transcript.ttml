<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">rich dialogue about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">not just philosophical practice but uh</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.360" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">dave is going to tell us about</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:54.240" style="s2">really has a lot more to do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">socrates as a as a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.199" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">practitioner</p>

<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s actually important to learn</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">we see philosophy i liked in uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">the the talk of the store the other</p>

<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">john vervecchi the way john used the</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">reverence reminded me of a way</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">word in philosophy a reverence for</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">wisdom which is a different thing than a</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">sort of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:45.120" style="s2">decision or arguing about propositions</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.120" end="00:22:51.080" style="s2">claims it was very much as as</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">adam alluded to earlier a practice an</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.080" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">experiential engagement</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">it was and this is a whole nother talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">my sense of looking at what philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">meant</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">socrates didn&#39;t use that word very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:06.840" style="s2">and it was just sort of vaguely</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:10.480" style="s2">uh sophistication or cultured thinking</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.840" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">before plato and in plato</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.480" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">it ends up being i very much the more i</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">look at plato the more i sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:23.360" style="s2">he was doing religion in another way</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.360" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">he was cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.360" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">advocating looking past appearances</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">to the miracle that everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:34.159" style="s2">participates in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">which he called the good as</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">a transformative dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">ultimately spiritual engagement</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">later aristotle has a more</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">rationalistic take and we get a split</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">again to me it looks like plato&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">another kind of religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">the split between the way we understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">and we understand philosophy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">gets in motion with</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">with aristotle notwithstanding some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">the the practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">transformative engagements of the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">um certainly in the the neoplatonus</p>

<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">platinus is a is a as a</p>

<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">um one last</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">comment i&#39;ll make this wasn&#39;t in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">essay so i didn&#39;t know what to do with</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:30.400" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:32.880" style="s2">but i&#39;ve been thinking about some more</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.400" end="00:24:36.000" style="s2">it&#39;s some 20 years later</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.880" end="00:24:38.480" style="s2">after his his his death his execution</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.000" end="00:24:39.600" style="s2">he&#39;s given hemlock poison he takes it</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.600" end="00:24:45.120" style="s2">some 20 years later or so uh plato does</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">an account of that event</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.120" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">in the the fido and</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:56.080" style="s2">socrates he has socrates last words be</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.320" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">is that like the allusion to the swan</p>

<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">seems a bit far-fetched to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">but another uh author who i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:17.679" style="s2">much more</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">that kind of resonates for me i&#39;ve often</p>

<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">example of experience from my childhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:10.840" style="s2">so much of contemplative material so</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">much of what also gets dubbed</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.840" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">mysticism um has a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:24.960" style="s2">um i&#39;ve studied it up and down i&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">learning and i&#39;ve done decades of</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">but a way i often uh use</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">to a story often used to kind of gesture</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:38.880" style="s2">towards my sense of what&#39;s a core</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">of contemplative experience i went</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.880" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">through what it&#39;s like to die</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">as a kid i&#39;m seven years old</p>

<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">on was its own worth of wonder before i</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">could remember my name</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">the fact that anything was happening was</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">was its own worth now this is my</p>

<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">he moved people in different ways but i</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:01.679" style="s2">wonder about that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">sense of his gratitude even</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.679" end="00:31:08.399" style="s2">for the experience of taking</p>

<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">is going on so that&#39;s the talk</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">thanks dave it&#39;s really rich terrain</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.880" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:30.799" style="s2">taking us through here um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:36.960" style="s2">you said a number of things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">i think if you haven&#39;t dug into the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.960" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">material and you haven&#39;t thought about</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">um too much or thought about it from</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">this perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">um you&#39;ve raised some points that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:48.320" style="s2">raise some points that would raise some</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.039" style="s2">eyebrows</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.320" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">is one way of putting it i think and i</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.039" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">um a lot of this comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:58.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:32:02.640" style="s2">we&#39;re used to thinking of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.799" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">reason or rationalism and philosophy as</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.640" end="00:32:06.880" style="s2">kind of a method of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">rationalism uh as like one pole</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.880" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2">of activity and religion and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:13.760" style="s2">spirituality is like another</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:14.080" style="s2">poll um and i think the controversial</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.760" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">part</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.080" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">isn&#39;t that in ancient times those two</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">polls were much closer together in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">kind of integral way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of um historically</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:27.840" style="s2">established and just sort of the case</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:30.240" style="s2">right like people readily accept that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.840" end="00:32:32.000" style="s2">but what people in modern times want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.240" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">extract as sort of the gold</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:35.519" style="s2">of socrates and plato is is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.519" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">rationality and the reason over and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">against that kind of religiosity and as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:43.840" style="s2">you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:45.279" style="s2">religiosity religion religious practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.840" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t a way they would have framed it at</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.279" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">that time</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">but when we look at it it looks more</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:51.919" style="s2">like contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">or at least related to contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.919" end="00:32:55.840" style="s2">practice reason as</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">nested within contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.840" end="00:33:00.159" style="s2">than something that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:02.320" style="s2">oppose those two things um but so what i</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.159" end="00:33:06.240" style="s2">want to do first is just</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.320" end="00:33:09.360" style="s2">uh draw out like the other poll</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.240" end="00:33:10.080" style="s2">the the the the other a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.360" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.080" end="00:33:13.279" style="s2">nearly the opposite of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">arguing and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.279" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">that person is john cooper um he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:19.519" style="s2">fantastic scholar</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.679" style="s2">right he&#39;s like scholar of the first</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.519" end="00:33:23.120" style="s2">order um</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.679" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">no qualms with the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.120" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">scholarship you know i this is a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">whose texts i learned from a lot he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">also studying these ancient greek texts</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">plato and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">stoicism and so forth but he&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">this book pursuits of wisdom where he</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">he actually takes this up as a theme and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">there he&#39;s arguing against um</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.840" style="s2">pierre hedoe and pierre hedoe&#39;s vision</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:48.640" style="s2">of philosophy as a way of life her</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.840" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">philosophy is spiritual exercise and i</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.640" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">hear what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">much closer to hadeau than to cooper</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:57.120" style="s2">but i want to read you this passage from</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">cooper and then ask you a question about</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">and so here&#39;s what he says in his book</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:03.279" style="s2">pursuits of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">cooper says the essential core of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.279" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">philosophy is a certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">specifically and recognizably</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">philosophical style</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:12.800" style="s2">of logical reasoned argument and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.800" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">one must take with utmost seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">that what the ancient philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">following socrates&#39;s innovative league</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">are pro</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">proposing is that we live our lives from</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">some set of argued through</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">rationally worked out rationally grasped</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">and rationally defended ideas about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">world and one&#39;s own place within it a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">philosophical way of life is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">in fundamental ways quite a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">from any religious way of life</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">so my question for you here is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a certain sense of of of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">reason and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">and a certain sense of religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">operating in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">cooper&#39;s analysis here um which i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">is sort of more the mainstream view</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.720" style="s2">um but i want to ask you how i how might</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">we think</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.720" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">differently of reason and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">and religion and how i how are we</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">supposed to think the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">between the two</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.359" style="s2">so on the one hand um again</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">notwithstanding my</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.359" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">ridiculous amount of education i</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">went to school and then to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">monasteries</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">wanting to know what is most</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">important what is most valuable in being</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:35.280" style="s2">alive</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">and i&#39;ll approach teachings texts</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.280" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">philosophies with a very pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">interest how can this help me</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">appreciate being alive</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">part of that then lends to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">uh realization as you alluded to earlier</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">the side view</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">our sense of rationality our</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">understanding and construction of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">religion is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">our understanding construction of</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">comes from somewhere those have</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">histories those are generated events</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">and as a sort of parable</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:20.560" style="s2">um it would be too long to to to go into</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">real uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.560" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">detail to sufficiently explain it but um</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">so much of contemplative practice is</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">appreciating the miracle of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">any and everything the way it is here</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">the associations of mysticism with like</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">say altered states</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:39.599" style="s2">um is is a bit overdrawn but i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:42.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.599" end="00:36:43.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve done some altered trade work for</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.000" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">the state&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.119" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">through old school buddhist uh genres</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">absorptions synthetic altered states</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">they occur in a sequence they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:55.200" style="s2">remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:56.800" style="s2">the buddhists will say don&#39;t get too</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.200" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">enamored of them just having sweet</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.800" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">to the point but having some uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">restoration having some recreation</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">but also just getting some further</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:09.200" style="s2">insight in what the mind is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:10.480" style="s2">is is sort of their worth following</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.200" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">10-day retreat</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.480" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">altered states really profound i mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:17.839" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">remarkable beautiful tear</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">evoking wonder in a set</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">sequence uh they&#39;re more than this but</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">standard four states</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">they unfold one after the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:35.280" style="s2">following attendant retreat doing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">i was doing it in my sleep</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">i was waking up at night in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.480" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">of the sequence together with what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">going to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.520" end="00:37:46.160" style="s2">metaphorically call a body memory of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">having done the first couple before i</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.160" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">woke up</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">what that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:58.560" style="s2">like a side view of our our historically</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:00.720" style="s2">generated notions of what&#39;s rational</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.560" end="00:38:04.400" style="s2">what&#39;s religious</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.720" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">our very identification with ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.400" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">in terms of our waking state our waking</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:14.800" style="s2">cognitive process comes from somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:16.079" style="s2">some part of me knows how to sleep some</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.800" end="00:38:17.839" style="s2">part of me knows how to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.079" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">waking some part of me knows how to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.839" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">the jaundice whether i&#39;m asleep or awake</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s a little bit of a roundabout</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:29.760" style="s2">reply</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">but two points to repeat our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.760" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">rationality is a generated phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s booted up and two</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">we have the unfortunate um</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">propensity to presume that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">the end-all and be-all that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">starting point and the end point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">all there is to us</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">is this this rational logical</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">argumentative</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">mode and in the last couple of centuries</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">in the west especially that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">had a sad preeminence it does us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">of good</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">if and when we remember it&#39;s a tool it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:08.800" style="s2">a utility</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">but if instead we make an idol out of it</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.800" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">that that&#39;s the only way to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">a human being and to know verities and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">uh ascertain values</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">uh then we&#39;ve uh sold ourselves short</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">that&#39;s great dave thanks for that um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.320" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">actually gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:33.119" style="s2">shift over to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:35.119" style="s2">the questions in the comments just</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.119" end="00:39:37.920" style="s2">because i see that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.119" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">hunter has a a couple of questions kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.920" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">of tied together that actually address</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:44.079" style="s2">some of the directions i was about to go</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">in anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.079" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">i&#39;m just looking at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">thinking maybe we can pass it off to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">to a general discussion hunter did you</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">want to ask that question yourself or do</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">you want me to read it</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">um i&#39;d be happy to jump in okay go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">um i just would like to try to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:04.720" style="s2">disentangle</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">the ancient sense of religion from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.720" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">modern sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">and to me the biggest confounding factor</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">dogma and so i wonder if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:20.480" style="s2">um anything to add about that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s coercion upon you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.480" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">anyone who adheres to a given religion</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">yeah um it&#39;s interesting to me the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">uh greeks and generations after uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">socrates and plato</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">became increasingly acquainted with the</p>

<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:40.800" style="s2">and called them philosophers that they</p>

<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">one thing that sort of struck me was um</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">the mode in which um socratic inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.880" style="s2">was undertaken you know both in socrates</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:31.760" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.880" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">and also his disciples in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">violence</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s a great book um i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">priebus the plato by havelock</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">that actually is in some ways kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">side view</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.160" style="s2">of what was happening in ancient greek</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">culture at the time the shift from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">oral</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">culture of where people were feeding you</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">memory to writing things down and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">he argued that the significance of his</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:57.200" style="s2">philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">trying to preserve this kind of oral</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.200" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">dialectic of interrogation</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:03.520" style="s2">of these questions about what is justice</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:06.880" style="s2">what is piety</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.520" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">and then then to this dialectical</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.880" end="00:44:12.960" style="s2">engagement but provoking an insight</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">about the true nature of reality um</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.960" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">and so but this so this is the media</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">ecology you know in the ancient greek</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">and now that we live in the world of uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">um can can the internet consume</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:29.760" style="s2">serve as a vehicle for types of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.680" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">contemplative practices</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.760" end="00:44:35.920" style="s2">um like the uh like socrates practice</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.000" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">um you know because i think there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.920" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">both a promise</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">and apparel you know from the different</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:43.200" style="s2">shifts from the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:46.560" style="s2">communicate</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.200" end="00:44:49.839" style="s2">you know information and trying to</p>

<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:08.240" style="s2">so you may know um socrates himself was</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.319" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">uh cherry about writing</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.240" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">he felt there was too much of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.319" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">potential that you alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.839" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">to merely hanging out with the words and</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">no longer having the lived</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">dialogic interpersonal uncovery and</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">discovery</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">and experiential engagement</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">um plato reflects that</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">in he writes dialogues people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">talking to each other they&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:32.800" style="s2">conversations they&#39;re questioning each</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">even in parties um socrates gets</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">shown up as not knowing what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">talking about in in</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">in the uh his uh talking about the forms</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">which incidentally uh is worth</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:52.079" style="s2">remembering so much the time</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">we ascribe to plato this dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">metaphysics about the forms and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.880" style="s2">everything participating in them</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:00.480" style="s2">there was something he&#39;s exploring and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.880" end="00:46:02.160" style="s2">in parmenides uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.480" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">uh he tells socrates you know this</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.160" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make any damn sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.200" style="s2">but i&#39;m reminded um</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">a little uh overly clunky</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">to me so much of this comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">an adverbial matter how we</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">do what we do how we be the miracle</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:26.839" style="s2">that we are how we engage with one</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">another</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">and i think the the resources are</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">and at the same time it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">requires that sort of personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">i was so moved the the the the storm</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.560" end="00:46:49.520" style="s2">meeting the other night</p>
