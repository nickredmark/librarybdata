<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:18.949" style="s2">to whose work is really going to take us</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:23.720" style="s2">into the very highest levels of not only</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.949" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">post conventional but post formal</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.720" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">cognitive development or what she would</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:33.239" style="s2">call ego development it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.110" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.239" end="00:00:42.899" style="s2">Suzanne cook Reuter is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.110" end="00:00:45.600" style="s2">meaning making in in that process one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.899" end="00:00:50.760" style="s2">the factors in meeting in meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.600" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">is cognitive development as we have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.760" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">talking about it but there are other</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">factors in meaning making that are not</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:06.180" style="s2">so evident in other models and so she</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">looks at the role for example of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.180" end="00:01:13.200" style="s2">awareness how we spatial eyes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">temporal eyes our understanding among</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.200" end="00:01:19.040" style="s2">other other factors that she includes</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">now some of you may be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:31.560" style="s2">this illustration that we see and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">the spiral of development and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.560" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">idea here is has cognitive development</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:45.259" style="s2">as we develop as people through these</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">stages the development is driven by a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.259" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">tension between two different poles and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:57.090" style="s2">so for example in some systems the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">tension is between agency or</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.090" end="00:02:04.259" style="s2">individualism and communion or</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">collectivism and the idea is that at</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:13.830" style="s2">each one of these stages you oscillate</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">the individual oscillates between</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.830" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">gem tech&#39; bias or being more agenting or</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:23.940" style="s2">individual to being more communal and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:26.610" style="s2">then more authentic in our individual</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.940" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">and more communal or group oriented and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.610" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">that there&#39;s this back and forth at each</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:38.490" style="s2">level of development that resolves the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:44.670" style="s2">tension in a kind of an oscillating way</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.490" end="00:02:47.580" style="s2">so at stage one there is a gent ik bias</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.670" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">at stage two communal it gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.580" end="00:02:55.020" style="s2">impression then that every other level</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">there&#39;s more in common there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.020" end="00:03:01.110" style="s2">in common certainly with respect to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">polarity at every other level then at</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.110" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">the level just before and so this tends</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">to give the every other stage some basis</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">for commonality and so they&#39;re cooked</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:25.100" style="s2">greater has emphasized or identified</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:30.750" style="s2">some polarities that are especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.100" end="00:03:38.209" style="s2">significant to in driving the</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.750" end="00:03:43.739" style="s2">conventional levels to post conventional</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.209" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">stages of ego development and so this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.739" end="00:03:53.330" style="s2">a relative to our theme today this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">obviously a dialectical movement in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.330" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">development that is part of her model</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">and so the polarities that she</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">emphasizes are part and whole self and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.770" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">outer and inner and by extension</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.850" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">objective and subjective short-term and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">linear versus long-term and nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.830" end="00:05:12.680" style="s2">and absolute versus relative and so she</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">sees that these play out on all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.680" end="00:05:20.130" style="s2">polarities play out at each stage of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:21.870" style="s2">development and they play out in</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.130" end="00:05:25.340" style="s2">different ways at each stage of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.870" end="00:05:28.110" style="s2">development so we see not only a</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.340" end="00:05:32.010" style="s2">dialectical aspect to the model of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.110" end="00:05:42.090" style="s2">cognition but it&#39;s pointing to something</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.010" end="00:05:58.080" style="s2">that is stage specific itself in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.090" end="00:06:08.660" style="s2">development so for example she outlines</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:11.660" style="s2">the development itself of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.660" end="00:06:11.660" style="s2">opposites</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.300" end="00:06:22.289" style="s2">and so at the early conventional stage</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.930" end="00:06:25.439" style="s2">for example she characterizes the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.289" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">understanding of OPS&#39;s opposites as just</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.439" end="00:06:30.930" style="s2">one thing this there is not even there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:36.449" style="s2">no there&#39;s no even not that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.930" end="00:06:39.210" style="s2">this and only a person at higher</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.449" end="00:06:42.509" style="s2">development looking in can see that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.210" end="00:06:44.580" style="s2">is only part of an opposite but in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.509" end="00:06:49.189" style="s2">case in very early stage there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:56.569" style="s2">this so it&#39;s it&#39;s not dialectical at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.189" end="00:06:56.569" style="s2">at the next stage it turns into this but</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.099" end="00:07:14.449" style="s2">at the conventional stage the way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.469" end="00:07:19.529" style="s2">opposites are held is this or that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.449" end="00:07:22.589" style="s2">an argument for example could have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.529" end="00:07:27.870" style="s2">either-or form prior to this you</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.589" end="00:07:33.749" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have an either-or form at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.870" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">pluralist stage the way the operatives</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.749" end="00:07:40.669" style="s2">are looked at or described are both end</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.050" end="00:07:56.370" style="s2">concept of mutuality and so we see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.620" end="00:07:59.009" style="s2">the progression of the way categories or</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.370" end="00:08:03.240" style="s2">opposite categories are actually talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.009" end="00:08:06.389" style="s2">about or handled or the form of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.240" end="00:08:09.180" style="s2">argument of explanation that a person</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.389" end="00:08:11.279" style="s2">has develops over time this is a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.180" end="00:08:13.439" style="s2">different than the sequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.279" end="00:08:17.370" style="s2">development or the profound shift that</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.439" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">we saw in the dualistic mind in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.370" end="00:08:24.630" style="s2">evolutionary story because now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:27.900" style="s2">working with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.630" end="00:08:29.580" style="s2">electical mind itself the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.900" end="00:08:33.210" style="s2">structure consciousness and we see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:36.510" style="s2">this dualism that&#39;s inherent in it</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.210" end="00:08:45.380" style="s2">itself develops over the lifetime of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.510" end="00:08:48.210" style="s2">individual now past here these are all</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.380" end="00:08:52.700" style="s2">conventional stages and so now we get</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.210" end="00:08:55.740" style="s2">into the post conventional ways of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.700" end="00:08:58.020" style="s2">construing or like pros come into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.740" end="00:09:00.780" style="s2">conception and opposites and they get</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.020" end="00:09:06.840" style="s2">more a little more complicated so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.780" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">have both and and either-or so these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.840" end="00:09:20.330" style="s2">both both included as appropriate so</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">what&#39;s appropriate for the situation</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.330" end="00:09:36.240" style="s2">either of both end or an either or or</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:38.940" style="s2">and of both end either/or so the modes</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.240" end="00:09:42.330" style="s2">of dealing with opposites become much</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.940" end="00:09:47.250" style="s2">more they&#39;re more more modes or more</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.330" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">choices available and this concept of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.250" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">healthy systems need to be inclusive as</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:03.720" style="s2">of all these options and so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:06.440" style="s2">high stage it&#39;s a post conventional</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.720" end="00:10:10.910" style="s2">stage and we will look further it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.440" end="00:10:10.910" style="s2">associated with the autonomous stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.280" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">beyond this are two other stages that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.620" end="00:10:25.790" style="s2">are very very rare and this one stage is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.230" end="00:10:29.250" style="s2">called the construct aware stage and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:38.630" style="s2">these are an awareness that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.250" end="00:10:38.630" style="s2">opposites arise as a function</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.620" end="00:10:55.020" style="s2">of language and that opposites are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.710" end="00:10:58.940" style="s2">in the world or the situation but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.020" end="00:11:04.230" style="s2">are in the mind and how it creates</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.940" end="00:11:07.080" style="s2">represents the world or the conditions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.230" end="00:11:11.250" style="s2">how it represents that in language or</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.080" end="00:11:13.530" style="s2">other symbolic representation so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.250" end="00:11:16.730" style="s2">constructor where stage there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.530" end="00:11:21.420" style="s2">huge ship so you no longer are that</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.730" end="00:11:27.990" style="s2">concerned with how to negotiate how to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.420" end="00:11:31.130" style="s2">negotiate opposites okay so in all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.990" end="00:11:34.500" style="s2">these you see a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.130" end="00:11:36.060" style="s2">effectiveness in complexification of how</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.500" end="00:11:41.360" style="s2">to negotiate opposites but if the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.060" end="00:11:58.730" style="s2">construct aware phase what opposites are</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.360" end="00:12:00.930" style="s2">really what I pose that are really okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.730" end="00:12:04.050" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get this out comes to</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.930" end="00:12:09.930" style="s2">the forefront okay now this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.050" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">very very big shift and so that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.930" end="00:12:25.490" style="s2">construct aware person understands that</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:25.490" style="s2">the framing of reality through language</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.570" end="00:12:34.190" style="s2">creates this condition or situation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.560" end="00:12:34.190" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:48.199" style="s2">and then that then turns over to one</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.689" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">highest stage that is described which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.199" end="00:12:56.779" style="s2">the unitive stage and in this case there</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:13:07.790" style="s2">is an awareness of what she calls the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.779" end="00:13:12.050" style="s2">dance of duality and non-duality and so</p>
