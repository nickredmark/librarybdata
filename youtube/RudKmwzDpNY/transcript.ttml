<p begin="00:00:11.720" end="00:00:15.480" style="s2">Now that you&#39;ve had an opportunity to walk through a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.480" end="00:00:22.280" style="s2">then, hopefully, some of the things that I&#39;m going to say, that are more technical, will make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.280" end="00:00:26.860" style="s2">and so, what we&#39;re going to do today, at least in part, is to deal with...</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.860" end="00:00:32.460" style="s2">to start to deal with conceptualizing a solution</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.460" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">to the fact that the world is too complex to properly perceive</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:43.700" style="s2">so what the problem fundamentally is is that there&#39;s a lot more of everything else than there is of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.700" end="00:00:50.340" style="s2">especially if you include in that everything else, all the parts of you that you also don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.340" end="00:00:53.540" style="s2">and so...</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.540" end="00:00:58.760" style="s2">I want to walk you through how I think we solve that, at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.760" end="00:01:02.720" style="s2">and we do that by, essentially by simplifying the world, but</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.720" end="00:01:12.200" style="s2">I think mostly that we simplify it as a place in which to act, rather than a place in which to perceive objects</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.200" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">and I really believe that there&#39;s a critical distinction between those two things</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:22.160" style="s2">and I think that part of the reason that there&#39;s been continual tension</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.160" end="00:01:26.380" style="s2">say, between the claims of science and, let&#39;s say, the claims of religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.380" end="00:01:37.060" style="s2">is because the idea that the world as a place of objects and as a place to act have to be considered separately, isn&#39;t properly understood</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.060" end="00:01:39.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t know...</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.700" end="00:01:44.140" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna try to straighten that up to the degree that that&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.140" end="00:01:47.860" style="s2">so, I&#39;m gonna talk to you about stories and meta-stories</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.860" end="00:01:53.920" style="s2">and the story, I would say, is the simplest unit of useful information</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.920" end="00:01:57.400" style="s2">with regards to action and perception that you can be offered</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.400" end="00:02:01.840" style="s2">and then a meta-story is a story about how a story like that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.840" end="00:02:04.460" style="s2">and I would say...</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.460" end="00:02:09.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll concentrate on the structure of the story</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.240" end="00:02:13.420" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll get into the structure of the meta-story, and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.420" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">that&#39;ll constitute today&#39;s... today&#39;s class</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">so the first thing I wanna show you... I know many of you have seen this, but I&#39;m gonna show it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:31.960" style="s2">for the longest time it was presumed that...</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.960" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">for the longest time, say, at least in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.700" end="00:02:40.880" style="s2">it was presumed that we make a pretty complete model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.880" end="00:02:45.400" style="s2">and then we act in the world, and we compare what happens to that model</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.400" end="00:02:53.100" style="s2">and as long as our model and the world are matching</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.100" end="00:03:01.420" style="s2">then, roughly speaking, we believe that everything is okay, and our emotions stay under control</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.420" end="00:03:07.380" style="s2">but if that model mismatches, then we know that something&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.380" end="00:03:12.920" style="s2">now, a lot of this work was done by Russians, especially in the early 60s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.920" end="00:03:18.860" style="s2">by two Russian scientists, Vinogradova and Sokolov</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.860" end="00:03:25.340" style="s2">who were students of Alexander Luria, who was arguably the greatest neuropsychologist of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.340" end="00:03:31.180" style="s2">Luria spent a lot of time studying soldiers from WW2 that had received head injuries</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.180" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">of various sorts, and because of that he could draw inferences about how the brain worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:41.360" style="s2">and some of what we&#39;re going to talk about over the upcoming weeks with regards to brain function</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:43.980" style="s2">much of it is predicated on Luria&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.980" end="00:03:48.980" style="s2">Sokolov and Vinogradova were his students, and they were interested in this phenomena...</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.980" end="00:03:52.440" style="s2">they were interested in psychophysiological measurement, right</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.440" end="00:03:54.860" style="s2">as a way of inferring brain function</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.860" end="00:03:59.660" style="s2">so psychophysiological measurement is measurement of those physiological parameters</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.660" end="00:04:05.260" style="s2">say, like pupil width, or skin conductance, or EEG</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.260" end="00:04:09.920" style="s2">that are in some ways directly reflective of how the brain works</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.920" end="00:04:16.860" style="s2">now, if you measure skin resistance, skin resistance changes with the amount that you sweat</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.860" end="00:04:24.040" style="s2">that can change very, very rapidly, and it changes in response to physiological demands placed on your body</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.040" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">so, for example, if your body assumes that you&#39;re going to leap into action for some purpose</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:33.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna open up your pores to prepare you to keep yourself cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.960" end="00:04:39.920" style="s2">and you can measure those transformations quite accurately by measuring the electrical resistance of the skin</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.920" end="00:04:45.340" style="s2">and so what you see, if you put someone in a lab chair</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.340" end="00:04:48.680" style="s2">and you expose themselves to different stimuli, you find that...</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.680" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">for example you can expose them to something that&#39;s threatening</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:57.260" style="s2">say, like a picture of a snake, then their skin conductance will decrease, because they&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.260" end="00:05:01.780" style="s2">sorry, their skin conductance will increase, because they sweat a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.780" end="00:05:05.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s quite a rapid response, it can be a very rapid response</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.540" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">now, one of the things that Sokolov...</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">yeah, that&#39;s right... noted was that if he...</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">if I sat you down, for example, and I put some headphones on you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:26.860" style="s2">and I played a tone to you that repeated, exactly the same tone that repeated at predictable intervals</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.860" end="00:05:30.780" style="s2">that the first time you heard the tone you&#39;d produce quite a spike in skin conductance</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.780" end="00:05:35.020" style="s2">and the next time a slightly smaller spike, and then the next time a slightly smaller spike</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.020" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">until after maybe you&#39;ve heard it three or four times, you would not respond to it at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">and that was often regarded as habituation</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.440" style="s2">and habituations is the same thing that you can see in snails, for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.440" end="00:05:53.640" style="s2">and I&#39;m using snails as an example, because they have very, very simple nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.640" end="00:05:56.340" style="s2">so if you take a snail and you poke it, then...</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.340" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">like it comes out of its shell and you poke it, it&#39;ll go back into its shell</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.520" end="00:06:03.060" style="s2">and then it&#39;ll come out, and if you poke it again it&#39;ll go back into its shell</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.060" end="00:06:07.820" style="s2">and it&#39;ll come out; but if you keep doing that, sooner or later the snail will just stop going in</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.820" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">and you might think of that... it has been conceptualized as the simplest form of learning</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:14.600" style="s2">habituation</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.600" end="00:06:22.320" style="s2">and the behaviorists tend to presume that if a human being manifested a response that could be modeled by a simple organism</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.320" end="00:06:26.920" style="s2">then the human being was using a response that was analogous to that of the simple organism</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.920" end="00:06:30.480" style="s2">and sometimes that&#39;s true, and sometimes it&#39;s not, so...</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.480" end="00:06:33.140" style="s2">for example, you have simple reflexes that, you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.140" end="00:06:37.180" style="s2">if you put your hand on a hot stove, you&#39;ll jerk back, and that&#39;s quite a simple circuit</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.180" end="00:06:40.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll move your hand back before the message gets to your brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.640" end="00:06:46.620" style="s2">because the spinal cord is smart enough to mediate a reflex like that all by itself</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.620" end="00:06:52.180" style="s2">so you know, your brains is actually quite distributed throughout your body, it&#39;s not just in your head like people tend to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.180" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">and so, we have conserved fast-acting reflexes at various levels of our nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:07.720" style="s2">they aren&#39;t capable of sophisticated response, it&#39;s pretty much stimulus - response</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.720" end="00:07:09.720" style="s2">thinking about it from the behavioral perspective</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.720" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">but they have as an advantage incredible speed, because they&#39;re just aren&#39;t that many neural connections between the stimulus and the response</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.200" end="00:07:21.720" style="s2">and so, we have layers of response at different time frames</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.720" end="00:07:26.420" style="s2">that help us match with the demands of the external environment</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.420" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">so Charles Darwin, for example, used to go into the, I think it was a museum in England, I don&#39;t remember the name of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:34.340" style="s2">the snake in there, I believe it was a cobra,</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.340" end="00:07:37.800" style="s2">and he&#39;d stick his face up at the glass, and the cobra would strike at him</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.800" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">and he&#39;d jerk back; and he tried many, many times to master that reflexive response to the snake, but there was no way</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:47.600" style="s2">every time that thing struck at him, he&#39;d jump backwards</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.600" end="00:07:53.260" style="s2">well, you can imagine the survival utility in a reflex like that, but in reflexes in general</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.260" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">okay, so back to Sokolov</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.160" style="s2">now, what he decided...</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.160" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">if you took that tone, and you did anything to it that was perceptible</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:08.440" style="s2">right, because there&#39;s certain gradations of tone that you&#39;re not capable of perceiving</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.440" end="00:08:12.940" style="s2">but let&#39;s assume you took the tone, and you would adjust it enough so that it was perceptibly louder</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.940" end="00:08:16.760" style="s2">or it was perceptibly a different frequency, or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.760" end="00:08:19.580" style="s2">or even that the spaces between the tones</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.580" end="00:08:21.740" style="s2">&#39;cause I said they were predictably spaced</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.740" end="00:08:25.260" style="s2">even if the spaces between the tones were changed</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.260" end="00:08:31.620" style="s2">then, when the change occurred, the orienting reflex would be reinstated, you&#39;d respond to it again</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.620" end="00:08:36.180" style="s2">and Sokolov tried to vary the tone on many, many parameters</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.180" end="00:08:42.100" style="s2">but no matter what parameter he varied it on, as long as you could detect it perceptibly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.100" end="00:08:45.820" style="s2">you&#39;d produce an orienting reflex; so Sokolov&#39;s idea was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.820" end="00:08:50.060" style="s2">you must be producing a complex internal model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.060" end="00:08:54.700" style="s2">that&#39;s in concordance with the world across pretty much every perceptible dimension</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.700" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">because if you weren&#39;t doing that, how in the world would you know that the tone had changed from what you had already learned about it?</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">and so, for the longest time, and this was also true for people who were investigating artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:14.180" style="s2">we had this idea that what people did was make a complex model of the world, and hold it in their minds, so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.180" end="00:09:20.380" style="s2">and then they&#39;d act in the world, and they compared what they expected to happen in the world with the model</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.380" end="00:09:23.480" style="s2">and as long as there was a match, then there was no orienting reflex</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.480" end="00:09:29.340" style="s2">now, the orienting reflex turns out to be quite a complex reflex, it&#39;s not merely an alteration in skin conductance</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.340" end="00:09:36.860" style="s2">what it is in essence is the manner in which you start to unfold your response to the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.860" end="00:09:39.980" style="s2">and the initial stages of that are very, very quick</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.980" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">but it&#39;s hard to tell when the orienting reflex stops, and when more complex learning begins</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:48.220" style="s2">they sort of shade into one another</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.220" end="00:09:51.940" style="s2">so the initial stages of the orienting reflex are quite reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.940" end="00:10:03.320" style="s2">but the later stages can be extraordinarily complex, so for example...</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.320" end="00:10:09.300" style="s2">well, I always think the example of betrayal is the best one, because it&#39;s so complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.300" end="00:10:15.400" style="s2">so imagine that you know, you come home and you find evidence, lipstick or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.400" end="00:10:19.280" style="s2">evidence that the person that you&#39;re with is betraying you</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.280" end="00:10:24.020" style="s2">the first thing that&#39;s going to happen is that you&#39;re going to orient, there&#39;s going to be a real shock, and that&#39;s reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.020" end="00:10:31.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very much akin to the response that you would manifest if you saw a predator, or a snake, or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.400" end="00:10:34.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s very instantaneous, you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.780" end="00:10:40.380" style="s2">and then that&#39;ll prepare you for action, you&#39;ll get ready to do whatever it is that you need to do next</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.380" end="00:10:43.080" style="s2">a very unpleasant thing; but then</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.080" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">it might take you even years to fully manifest the learning that would be necessary in a situation like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:53.640" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many things that you have to reconsider</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.640" end="00:10:57.900" style="s2">first of all, the person might now appear to you as a threat, that&#39;s pretty immediate</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.900" end="00:11:02.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s a biological, physiological response first, your body reacts first</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.360" end="00:11:11.400" style="s2">then you respond emotionally, that&#39;s gonna take a while, and you know, the emotional response might extend over days, or weeks, or months, or even years</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.400" end="00:11:17.160" style="s2">and then, as you&#39;re doing that as well, you&#39;re going to try to start to re-sort out your interpretive schema</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.160" end="00:11:22.060" style="s2">so that it can adjust to the transformation that this...</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.060" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">this error on your part, say, or this catastrophe, or this betrayal</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.660" end="00:11:31.020" style="s2">it has to adjust to whatever information that event contains</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.020" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">and so the orienting reflex can manifest itself over an extraordinarily long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:43.100" style="s2">it&#39;s best to think about it as the initial part of what can be a very complex learning process</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.100" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">now, that was a standard idea in psychology for the longest period of time</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:54.300" style="s2">that we created a detailed internal model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.300" end="00:11:58.580" style="s2">and we watched how the world was unfolding, we compared the two</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.580" end="00:12:04.480" style="s2">and the physiology, the neurophysiology of this was even understood to some degree, even by the Russians</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.480" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">in the early 1960s, because they basially localized...</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:12.280" style="s2">you could use complex EEG, electroencephalogram technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.280" end="00:12:19.560" style="s2">to localize where the orienting reflex was occurring in the brain, and basically it appeared to occur, roughly speaking, in the hippocampus</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.560" end="00:12:25.720" style="s2">and the theory arose that your brain, your cortex, let&#39;s say, produced a very complex model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.720" end="00:12:30.380" style="s2">an internal model; and your sense were producing a model of the external world</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.380" end="00:12:34.480" style="s2">and the hippocampus was watching those things to see if they matched</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.480" end="00:12:38.540" style="s2">and if they didn&#39;t match, there was a mismatch signal, and that would be the orienting reflex</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.540" end="00:12:44.620" style="s2">and then your body would start to prepare itself for whatever that mismatch meant</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.620" end="00:12:49.340" style="s2">and then you would engage in exploratory behavior to try to update your model</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.340" end="00:12:53.400" style="s2">that was the standard theory, it was a very well accepted theory</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.400" end="00:12:56.220" style="s2">it has elements of cybernetic theory in it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.220" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">but it was accepted enough so that when people first started to experiment with artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:05.980" style="s2">that&#39;s how they tried to make artificially intelligent systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.980" end="00:13:12.280" style="s2">they tried to make ones that would model the world, and then act, and then compare the changes in the world to that model</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.280" end="00:13:15.580" style="s2">but that didn&#39;t go anywhere, it turned out, because it turned out that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.580" end="00:13:22.380" style="s2">it&#39;s so difficult to see and model the world that people had no idea how complex that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:26.900" style="s2">it was impossibly complex, as it turned out, and so that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.900" end="00:13:30.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t have robots wandering around, doing apparently simple things like walking</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.980" end="00:13:33.180" style="s2">walking in an environment like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.180" end="00:13:39.400" style="s2">now, when we look at the environment, we think: well, it&#39;s not that hard to look at, it&#39;s full of objects</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.400" end="00:13:43.400" style="s2">they&#39;re just self-evident, there they are, and we can just wander through it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.400" end="00:13:47.160" style="s2">you know, and we don&#39;t even do that consciously to any great degree</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.160" end="00:13:52.300" style="s2">because so much of that perception is presented to our consciousness without effort</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.300" end="00:13:59.780" style="s2">in some sense; but the AI guys learned pretty quick that perceiving the world was waaay more difficult than anybody had guessed</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.780" end="00:14:08.820" style="s2">and then this experiment really in some sense put a phenomenological punch behind that observation</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.820" end="00:14:15.060" style="s2">because one of the presuppositions of the orienting reflex theory that I just laid out was that:</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.060" end="00:14:18.420" style="s2">you were very good at detecting changes</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.420" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">that your nervous system would automatically detect change, anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:26.420" style="s2">right, any mismatch between your model and what you expected, and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.420" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">well, the AI guys, I think, figured out first of all that was a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">that the problem of perception was much more complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:42.580" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s actually... it&#39;s out of that same set of observations in some sense that Postmodernism emerged in liternature...</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.640" end="00:14:45.540" style="s2">in literary criticism, because, well</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.540" end="00:14:50.000" style="s2">it turns out to be hard enough to see a normal object, like a chair</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.000" end="00:14:55.660" style="s2">and part of that is that if you just do that to the chair, it&#39;s really different than it was before</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.660" end="00:15:00.860" style="s2">you could imagine, how different it would be if you tried to paint the chair under both those conditions, right</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.860" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">if you really got good at looking at it you&#39;d find that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.420" style="s2">even though, if I asked you what color this is, you&#39;d say white</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.420" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">if you were actually painting it, you&#39;d find out that the colors of the chair when it&#39;s in that location</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.520" style="s2">and the colors in the chair when it&#39;s in that location, just because of the difference in lighting</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.520" end="00:15:19.520" style="s2">are substantially different</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.520" end="00:15:21.960" style="s2">I think it was Monet, I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.960" end="00:15:29.560" style="s2">who painted a very large series of haystacks in the French countryside in different seasons and under different conditions of illumination</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.560" end="00:15:35.880" style="s2">just because he was exploring how radically different the same object could be as it moved through contexts</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.880" end="00:15:40.600" style="s2">so it isn&#39;t even obvious why we think this is the same object when you move it</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.600" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">and the answer is something like: well, you can sit on it in both positions</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:47.880" style="s2">which is not a description of an object, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.880" end="00:15:54.400" style="s2">right? that&#39;s a description of something that&#39;s useful, something that&#39;s a tool, something that exists in relationship to your body</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.400" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not an object; and so...</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:02.040" style="s2">if you think that just looking at something like a chair is almost impossibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.040" end="00:16:04.320" style="s2">and subject to interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.320" end="00:16:09.520" style="s2">then imagine how difficult it is to perceive something like a text, you know, like a novel</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.520" end="00:16:14.200" style="s2">because a novel obviously is subject to multiple interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.200" end="00:16:18.580" style="s2">and the interpretations are gonna depend on, well, at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.580" end="00:16:22.300" style="s2">on the intent, conscious and unconscious, of the author</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.300" end="00:16:26.140" style="s2">of the time, of the place, of the culture, of the language</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.140" end="00:16:31.840" style="s2">then that&#39;s just on the side of the production itself, but then there&#39;s the reader</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.840" end="00:16:36.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like, I&#39;ve read books when I was sixteen, and then reread them, say, when I was forty</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.460" end="00:16:39.480" style="s2">and the book was almost completely different, as far as I was concerned</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.480" end="00:16:44.620" style="s2">partly &#39;cause I knew what was in it the second time, and I didn&#39;t know what was in it the first time</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.620" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">and so, the meaning that manifests itself out of a book</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">is a consequence of all the complexity of the book plus all the complexity of the reader, and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:02.920" style="s2">you know, if you&#39;re reading Russian literature, for example, and you&#39;ve already read fifty Russian novels</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:08.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be in a much more different interpretive space</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.440" end="00:17:13.080" style="s2">than you are if, say, the Russian novel is the first novel you&#39;ve ever read</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.100" end="00:17:17.640" style="s2">and the Postmodernists were grappling with this</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.640" end="00:17:23.300" style="s2">as well as with many other ideas that I think contaminated their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.300" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">and their conclusion was: well, you can&#39;t extract out a canonical meaning from a text</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:36.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so dependent on the situation that to say the text has an interpretable meaning is actually an error, now</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.440" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">just because it&#39;s difficult to do something doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.180" style="s2">and there&#39;s massive holes in the postmodernist view</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.180" end="00:17:47.900" style="s2">I think it&#39;s an unbelievably pathological view, personally</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.900" end="00:17:52.600" style="s2">but the thing is is that there are reasons why it emerged</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.600" end="00:17:57.260" style="s2">and the reasons were analogous to the reasons that the AI project initially failed</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.260" end="00:18:01.960" style="s2">and analogous to the reasons that this experiment turned out the way it did</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.960" end="00:18:06.860" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna show you this, many of you have seen this already, but as I said, it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.860" end="00:18:13.080" style="s2">your job here is to count the times... there&#39;s a team of three people here, dressed in white</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.080" end="00:18:16.040" style="s2">and there&#39;s a team of three people here dressed in black</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.040" end="00:18:22.560" style="s2">and your job is to count the number of times the white team throws the baskeball back and forth to the white team members</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.560" end="00:18:24.560" style="s2">ok, we&#39;ll just run that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:58.280" style="s2">okay, well, so, obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.280" end="00:19:03.060" style="s2">or perhaps not so obviously, the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.060" end="00:19:09.040" style="s2">the number of times I believe that they threw it back and forth was sixteen, if I remember this correctly</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.040" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">but of course that&#39;s not really the issue, because what happens in the middle of the scene is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:20.680" style="s2">a guy wearing a gorilla suit comes out into the middle of the screen, and pounds his chest three or four times</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.680" end="00:19:26.020" style="s2">he comes out quite slowly, as you saw; is there anybody in here who didn&#39;t see the gorilla?</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.020" end="00:19:30.060" style="s2">no, well, I presume all of you knew about this video anyways</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.060" end="00:19:34.260" style="s2">so, Dan Simon, who produced this video has got a couple of other ones</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.260" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">where he shows that, you know, even if you&#39;re smart enough to see the gorilla, &#39;cause you&#39;ve seen the video before you&#39;ve heard about it</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:47.220" style="s2">if you make other changes in the background, you&#39;ll count properly and you&#39;ll catch the gorilla, but you&#39;ll miss the other changes in the background</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.220" end="00:19:49.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re not trivial either, it&#39;s really quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.960" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">he&#39;s produced other short videos, for example, where you&#39;ll be looking at a... like a field</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:02.260" style="s2">and a road will grow in it, occupying about a third of the photograph&#39;s space</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.260" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">and you&#39;d think well, yeah, you&#39;re gonna see that, it&#39;s like: you don&#39;t, you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:10.120" style="s2">so, okay, so this threw a big spanner into the works</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.120" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">this sort of experiment, along with the AI failures, and we could even say, the postmodern dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:19.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well, hmm, everyone, virtually...</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.180" end="00:20:25.680" style="s2">every psychologist would&#39;ve predicted before this series of experiments that there&#39;s no damn way you&#39;d miss that gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.680" end="00:20:29.760" style="s2">because your nervous system was actually attuned to change in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.760" end="00:20:32.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s a big change, and it&#39;s also a gorilla</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.600" end="00:20:37.300" style="s2">it&#39;s something you would really think that you couldn&#39;t miss, you couldn&#39;t possibly miss</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.300" end="00:20:41.700" style="s2">especially when it&#39;s occupying the center of the visual field</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.700" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">and so, well, this is part of a phenomena called change blindness</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:50.980" style="s2">and it helped psychologists who had been studying the visual system for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.980" end="00:20:56.480" style="s2">to figure out, well mostly figure out exactly how blind human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.480" end="00:20:59.720" style="s2">because we&#39;re way blinder than we think, and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.720" end="00:21:03.980" style="s2">and so we actually focus on much less of the world than we think, and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.980" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">we do that partly... it&#39;s not exactly obvious how we do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">it&#39;s kinda like we hold a still picture in our imagination</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:15.660" style="s2">and then fill in the details by using our central foveal vision</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.660" end="00:21:20.820" style="s2">which is always dancing around like a pinpoint or a laser beam, moving back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.820" end="00:21:27.580" style="s2">and we&#39;re assembling those little snapshots from the fovea into a relatively coherent picture</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.580" end="00:21:32.180" style="s2">maybe what happens is that I look at you, and then I look at you [points to a different student]</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.180" end="00:21:38.540" style="s2">and I&#39;ve still got the information from looking at you, so my brain can sort of infer that that&#39;s remained stable</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.540" end="00:21:40.960" style="s2">but like if I look at you, and I...</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.960" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">I tried to learn how to do this, &#39;cause you can look at something, and then pay attention to the periphery, it&#39;s annoying</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:52.620" style="s2">but, so if I&#39;m looking at you, I really can&#39;t make out your eyes [points to a different student]</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.620" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">I can more or less make out the fact that you have a head</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:22:02.380" style="s2">especially if you move it, so your periphery is sory of like frog vision or dinosaur vision</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.380" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">it&#39;s much better at picking up movement than it is at picking up something that&#39;s staying still</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:13.040" style="s2">and that makes sense, because, well, if it&#39;s staying still, and it hasn&#39;t already hurt you, then</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.040" end="00:22:18.780" style="s2">it&#39;s probably not going to hurt you; but if it&#39;s moving, then, you know, that&#39;s a good thing that you might pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.780" end="00:22:22.700" style="s2">and so, if your periphery catches movement, then you&#39;ll focus your fovea on it</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.700" end="00:22:26.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like you go from really low resolution to really high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.900" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">so the center of your vision is incredibly high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:34.980" style="s2">but then it fades into low resolution as you move towards the periphery, until it&#39;s out here</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.980" end="00:22:38.500" style="s2">which would be about 170 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.500" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">if I concentrate on this hand I can tell it&#39;s a hand, mostly when it&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">I have no idea what color it is, this one I can&#39;t see at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:53.700" style="s2">and then, I can probably see my fingers - now</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.700" end="00:22:58.140" style="s2">and then I can clearly see them if I look at them with my fovea, and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.140" end="00:23:03.600" style="s2">your vision is a very, very strange thing, and it&#39;s focusing on something very specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.600" end="00:23:08.980" style="s2">and so you&#39;re pointing your eyes at something very specific, and that&#39;s what you seem to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.980" end="00:23:14.040" style="s2">so then that opens up a whole new universe of questions, it&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.040" end="00:23:16.900" style="s2">how do you decide what to point your eyes at?</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.900" end="00:23:21.340" style="s2">that turns out to be an insanely complicated problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.340" end="00:23:25.280" style="s2">John Vervaeke talks about that all the time as the problem of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.280" end="00:23:31.480" style="s2">and the issue is: well, there&#39;s many, many things in the world, there&#39;s an infinite number of things, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.480" end="00:23:37.080" style="s2">and you&#39;re not gonna be able to see them, that&#39;s for sure, even if they happen to be changing, as it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.080" end="00:23:41.040" style="s2">and so, out of this mess, first of all, how do you pick what to look at?</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.040" end="00:23:46.180" style="s2">and second, even if you do pick it, how do you see it? &#39;cause it&#39;s so crazily complicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.180" end="00:23:49.780" style="s2">so that&#39;s the problem that we&#39;re going to try to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.780" end="00:23:54.080" style="s2">now, roughly speaking, what seems to have happened with the gorilla video is</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.080" end="00:24:00.820" style="s2">you have to take that first theory, that you make a complete model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.820" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">which is the objects in the world, and how they&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">and you compare that to the objects in the actual world and how they&#39;re interacting</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">you have to modify that model, you say: well, no, you&#39;re certainly not making a complete model</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:18.180" style="s2">and people should have known better anyways; even subjects to the limits of your perception, because</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.180" end="00:24:22.680" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things in the world that you can&#39;t directly perceive, but</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.680" end="00:24:28.140" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing instead is something like: you&#39;re making a partial model of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.140" end="00:24:33.300" style="s2">but you&#39;re only making a partial model of the world that you&#39;re currently operating on</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.300" end="00:24:35.300" style="s2">with some goal in mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.300" end="00:24:39.340" style="s2">and you&#39;re also comparing that to a model of the world as it&#39;s currently unfolding</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.340" end="00:24:45.000" style="s2">&#39;cause the other thing that was implicit... this is really tricky, this is where you have to watch your implicit assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.000" end="00:24:50.620" style="s2">the other thing that was implicit in the original cybernetic theory was that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.620" end="00:24:54.460" style="s2">you have a model of the world that&#39;s complete</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.460" end="00:24:58.280" style="s2">and then what you&#39;re watching is the actual world as it unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.280" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a model, that&#39;s just your perception of the object; but that also turns out to be wrong, because</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:08.640" style="s2">your perception of the world as it unfolds is also a model, and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.640" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is: you look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.740" style="s2">the world you see is a model, and a very partial model at that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.740" end="00:25:20.980" style="s2">and then you compare it to the model that you expect or desire, more accurately, desire</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.980" end="00:25:23.860" style="s2">although the initial models were expectation</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.860" end="00:25:27.460" style="s2">because if you&#39;re in the lab, listening to tones it&#39;s not like you desire anything</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.460" end="00:25:31.240" style="s2">but mostly when you&#39;re acting in the world, you have desires</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.240" end="00:25:38.060" style="s2">so the experimental constraints skewed the data in some sense by making people assume that</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.060" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">what people were doing when they walked through the world was expecting instead of desiring</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:46.280" style="s2">anyways, you have a model of the world that&#39;s generated as you look at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.280" end="00:25:49.820" style="s2">you have another model of the world that&#39;s something like the world that you desire</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:56.380" style="s2">then you compare both of them, and they can mismatch, and they can mismatch in a way that upsets your current pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.380" end="00:25:58.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the critical issue</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.380" end="00:26:02.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t see the anomaly unless it upsets your current pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.660" end="00:26:04.660" style="s2">and you kinda know that too, because when you&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.660" end="00:26:07.580" style="s2">like, while I&#39;m lecturing to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.580" end="00:26:14.900" style="s2">you know, mostly you&#39;re sitting still, but people are moving their arms, and they&#39;re moving their glasses, and they&#39;re shifting their feet, and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.900" end="00:26:19.880" style="s2">generally I don&#39;t see any of that, because what difference does it make?</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.880" end="00:26:25.580" style="s2">you know, it&#39;s not relevant to the ongoing... to the ongoing what?</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.580" end="00:26:30.120" style="s2">ongoing contract? the ongoig series of interactions? it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.120" end="00:26:33.480" style="s2">so as long as you keep your movements bounded</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.480" end="00:26:38.340" style="s2">within a range that doesn&#39;t interfere with whatever it is we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.340" end="00:26:43.520" style="s2">then it&#39;s going to be as invisible to me as the gorilla was when you were counting the balls</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.520" end="00:26:46.980" style="s2">and the cool thing is about the gorilla experiment, or one of them, is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.980" end="00:26:51.160" style="s2">the reason you were blind to the gorilla was because you were counting the balls</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.160" end="00:26:58.940" style="s2">and so, that&#39;s so fascinating , because what it shows to a huge degree, to an unfathomable degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.940" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">to an unfathomable degree is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:07.100" style="s2">the value structure that you inhabit determines what you perceive</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.100" end="00:27:12.780" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t just determine what you expect or want, it bloody well determines what you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.780" end="00:27:17.100" style="s2">and that makes the world a completely different place, no one really expected that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.100" end="00:27:22.580" style="s2">and so, if you watch the basketball, you see the basketball</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.580" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">if you stop watching the basketball, well then you see the gorilla, and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.780" style="s2">the first question that arises from an experiment like that is:</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.780" end="00:27:36.600" style="s2">just exactly what is it that you don&#39;t see in the world? and the answer is: all of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.600" end="00:27:41.780" style="s2">you see so little it&#39;s unbelievable; you see that tiny amount that&#39;s necessary</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.780" end="00:27:46.800" style="s2">for you to undertake the next sequence in your plotted movements...?</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.800" end="00:27:50.860" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that; but then that becomes very complicated, too, because</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.860" end="00:27:57.820" style="s2">it isn&#39;t obvious how you can conceptualize or how you can determine what your next movement is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.820" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s not like you just add up movements and make up your life</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:09.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not that simple, and it&#39;s related to the novel problem, the problem of meaning in a literary work</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.680" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">so imagine: you&#39;re trying to specify the meaning of a literary work, well</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:22.080" style="s2">there&#39;s meaning in the word, but the meaning of the word is dependent on the phrase within which it&#39;s embedded</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.080" end="00:28:26.800" style="s2">and then the meaning of the phrase is dependent on the sentence that it&#39;s embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.800" end="00:28:31.180" style="s2">and the sentence in the paragraph, and the paragraph in the chapter, and the chapter in the book</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.180" end="00:28:34.360" style="s2">and the book in the corpus of books of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.360" end="00:28:40.220" style="s2">and then within the culture, and then within whatever your peculiar personal experience is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.220" end="00:28:47.020" style="s2">all of those things, nested, are operative to some degree when you&#39;re extracting out the meaning at any level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.020" end="00:28:49.740" style="s2">they&#39;re all operating simultaneously, so you might say, well</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.740" end="00:28:52.740" style="s2">what are you doing in this classroom?</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.740" end="00:28:56.340" style="s2">well, the answer is: sitting in a chair</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.340" end="00:29:03.580" style="s2">but that&#39;s... obviously that&#39;s a very short-term and context-independent answer</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.580" end="00:29:07.500" style="s2">but you&#39;re also attending to what I&#39;m saying, hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.500" end="00:29:13.080" style="s2">and you&#39;re attending to some of it, and not to other parts, you&#39;re thinking about some parts and not other parts</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.080" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">and you&#39;re also attending a class, and a class is a sequence of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s embedded within your desire to finish up the semester</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.040" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">and then to finish up the year, and then to get your degree</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:30.580" style="s2">and then you nest that inside whatever it is, whatever the reason it is that you&#39;re getting your degree</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.580" end="00:29:35.400" style="s2">and then maybe that&#39;s nested inside your career goals, and that&#39;s nested inside your life goals</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.400" end="00:29:40.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s nested inside your ultimate values, which you may or may not even be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.380" end="00:29:46.060" style="s2">and so, I could say, well, you&#39;re sitting here because it serves your ultimate values</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.060" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">well, that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">it seems a bit abstract to be useful, right, it&#39;s so vague out at the outermost levels, that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:00.520" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really have much specificity, right, so it seems to lack information, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.520" end="00:30:03.500" style="s2">by the same token if I said what you&#39;re doing is sitting there</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.500" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">it has the same problem of too restricted meaning, because of overspecificity</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:15.540" style="s2">and so, there&#39;s some level in there that you would interpret as meaningful, God only knows why</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.540" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s the level... there&#39;s a natural level of perception for that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:27.380" style="s2">so for example, when children learn to name an animal, for example, they&#39;ll name &quot;cat&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.380" end="00:30:31.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t name the species of cat, or the subspecies of cat</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.400" end="00:30:38.020" style="s2">and they don&#39;t confuse cats with dogs, even though they&#39;re both in the category of &quot;four-legged furry mammal&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.020" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">so, why not call the cat and the dog &quot;furry mammals&quot;?</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.280" end="00:30:46.700" style="s2">well, children don&#39;t do that, they go to &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;dog&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.700" end="00:30:54.300" style="s2">and people who&#39;ve studied the acquisition of language have found that there are basic-level categories that children pick up first</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.300" end="00:31:00.400" style="s2">and they&#39;re often represented with short words, and the words are short, because they&#39;ve been around a long time</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.400" end="00:31:04.800" style="s2">because they seem to reflect the natural level at which people perceive the world</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.800" end="00:31:08.320" style="s2">but none of that&#39;s obvious, you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.320" end="00:31:14.400" style="s2">I mean you could just lump all animals together, for that matter, and just call them &quot;animals&quot;, which we do sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.400" end="00:31:16.160" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.160" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">anyways, so it&#39;s very difficult to specify the meaning level, and it&#39;s not very easy at all to figure out how we do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s partly what I&#39;m trying to unpack, so...</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:32.700" style="s2">here&#39;s part of the issue, so let&#39;s say that you&#39;re... you have a computer</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.700" end="00:31:36.700" style="s2">yeah, I have a story for this, so</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.700" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">one time, when I was in Montreal, I was using my computer</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:44.340" style="s2">I was in my apartment</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.340" end="00:31:49.820" style="s2">and I was typing out an essay, and it crashed, and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.820" end="00:31:54.840" style="s2">what happens when your computer crashes? well, you know, usually you utter some sort of curse</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.840" end="00:32:00.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that you do that, because the circuit that you use to curse with</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.400" end="00:32:06.040" style="s2">is the same circuit that monkeys use to detect eagles, or leopards, or snakes</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.040" end="00:32:09.320" style="s2">and so, when there&#39;s a bunch of monkeys together</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.320" end="00:32:12.540" style="s2">you know, they&#39;re not all preyed on by eagles and leopards and snakes, but</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.540" end="00:32:16.600" style="s2">you know, there&#39;s usually a predator in that category for every single monkey population</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.600" end="00:32:23.720" style="s2">and so, when the monkeys are watching, they have an emotional utterance that the most nervous monkey might utter first</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.720" end="00:32:31.340" style="s2">that basically says, you know, hide from the eagle; get out on the thin branch, so the cougar can&#39;t eat you; and look the hell out for the snake</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.340" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">but there&#39;s a circuit that&#39;s linked to emotions that produces that instinctive utterance that represents that category</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.700" end="00:32:42.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s the same circuit that you use when you curse</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.680" end="00:32:45.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s not the same circuit that you use for normal language</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.720" end="00:32:50.300" style="s2">we know that, because that circuit is activated in people who have Tourette&#39;s syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.300" end="00:32:52.420" style="s2">because they preferentially swear</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.420" end="00:32:57.540" style="s2">you think, well, why in the world would you have a neurological condition that makes you preferentially curse?</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.540" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">well, that&#39;s the reason: you don&#39;t just have one linguistic circuit</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.880" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">you have one for: &quot;oh my God, there&#39;s a predator!&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:10.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s the one that will get activated when something happens like your computer crashing</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.620" end="00:33:16.980" style="s2">because, you know, you&#39;re an evolved creature, and so those old circuits that were there, say, 30 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.980" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">to deal with exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">are the same circuits you&#39;re using now to deal with your computer; why else would you wanna hit it?</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:28.780" style="s2">right? &#39;cause that&#39;s what you want - give it a whack! it&#39;s like: it doesn&#39;t behave - whack!</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.780" end="00:33:36.560" style="s2">aggression right away, well, that&#39;s some clue as to the category system that you&#39;re automatically using</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.560" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">to encapsulate the event</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:41.880" style="s2">ok, so fine, what do you do when your computer crashes?</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.880" end="00:33:47.880" style="s2">well, first you curse, and then you do the stupid things that idiot primates do when they&#39;re trying to deal with something that&#39;s way too complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.880" end="00:33:51.620" style="s2">maybe you turn it on and off, right? and that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.620" end="00:33:56.740" style="s2">it didn&#39;t work, and so then I thought, well, maybe the power bar went, so I checked the power bar</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.740" end="00:33:58.840" style="s2">and I turned it on and off, and nothing happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.840" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">so I brought a light behind the computer, and the light wouldn&#39;t go on, so I thought, aha!</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:08.560" style="s2">I must have blown a fuse! so I went to the fuse box and took a look, but the fuses were fine</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.560" end="00:34:14.360" style="s2">and so I thought, well, the power&#39;s gone out, so then I went outside, and the power was out</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.360" end="00:34:17.260" style="s2">none of the street light were working, the power was out everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.260" end="00:34:25.800" style="s2">and it was seriously out, because this was the time that almost the entire northeast power grid in Quebec collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.800" end="00:34:28.760" style="s2">and the reason it collapsed was because there was a solar flare</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.760" end="00:34:33.760" style="s2">that happens reasonably often, a solar flare produced a huge electromagnetic pulse</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.760" end="00:34:39.560" style="s2">because it&#39;s basically, you know, like a million hydrogen bombs going off at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.560" end="00:34:41.560" style="s2">93 million miles away</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.560" end="00:34:44.660" style="s2">produces this tremendous electromagnetic pulse</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.660" end="00:34:47.240" style="s2">passes through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.240" end="00:34:52.500" style="s2">produces a spike in current in the main power lines, and blows the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.500" end="00:35:00.180" style="s2">and so, just so you know, an event like that happens about every 150 years</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.180" end="00:35:03.080" style="s2">and if we had one now, it would take out all of our electronics</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.080" end="00:35:05.820" style="s2">like one of the big ones, there was a big one in the late 1800&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.820" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">everything, satellites, computers, cars, everything - gone</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:13.220" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a big problem, and no one knows what to do about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.220" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">one missed us by about nine minutes, I think two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.740" end="00:35:21.420" style="s2">so that&#39;s something else to worry about, if you&#39;re inclined to worry about those sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.420" end="00:35:28.200" style="s2">um, ok, so what did I conclude from that? well, the...</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.200" end="00:35:32.680" style="s2">the function of my computer was dependent on the stability of the sun</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.680" end="00:35:35.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not the first thing you check out when your computer crashes, right?</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.320" end="00:35:39.620" style="s2">you don&#39;t run out and go, hey, well, yeah, the sun&#39;s still there :)</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.620" end="00:35:42.460" style="s2">no problem, I can cross that off the list</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.460" end="00:35:49.500" style="s2">but to me it&#39;s an extraordinarily interesting example of the invisible interdependence of things</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.500" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">you know, and our tendency to fragment the...</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:58.180" style="s2">what we seem to do is to look at things at the simplest level of analysis that actually functions</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.180" end="00:36:04.280" style="s2">so, for example, when you&#39;re interacting with your computer, you&#39;re not interacting with your computer at all, really</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.280" end="00:36:08.140" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with the keyboard, sort of one key at a time</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.140" end="00:36:11.660" style="s2">and you&#39;re interacting with the symbols on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.660" end="00:36:17.680" style="s2">but as long as the computer is working, you don&#39;t care about it at all, you don&#39;t give it a second thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.680" end="00:36:22.180" style="s2">and you certainly don&#39;t care about the fact that it&#39;s dependent on...</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.180" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">well, the electrical power, for example, and the electrical power is dependent on...</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:34.040" style="s2">you know, I don&#39;t know how many men are out there right now or were out there last night, when it was freezing rain</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.040" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">fixing power lines and freezing to death while they&#39;re doing it, so that your stupid computer doesn&#39;t malfunction while you&#39;re watching cat videos</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">you know, I mean there&#39;s this incredibly dynamic living system, that&#39;s social, and economic, and political</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:52.740" style="s2">that has to remain dead-stable in order for us to have access to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.740" end="00:36:59.260" style="s2">functional and pure, non-fluctuating electricity 100% of the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.260" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">&#39;cause you also don&#39;t think, well, the stability of your computer is dependent on the stability of the political system</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:09.640" style="s2">but of course it is, because if the political system mucks up, and the economic system goes, then</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.640" end="00:37:14.520" style="s2">people don&#39;t go out and work to fix things; and things are breaking all the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.520" end="00:37:19.640" style="s2">that&#39;s their normal state, is broken, not working; and so...</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.640" end="00:37:25.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s all in some sense folded up not only inside your computer</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.140" end="00:37:31.460" style="s2">but actually inside your tiny conceptions of the computer while you&#39;re using it</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.460" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">and you only get a glimpse of what the computer is really like when it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">then it&#39;s when it becomes a complex object, right</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:47.340" style="s2">as long as it&#39;s working, then your stupid perceptions are perfectly fine to get the job done</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.340" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s another indication of what you&#39;re using your perceptions for is to get the job done</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.180" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">and how you specify exactly the  level of resolution that you should be operating at</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:05.480" style="s2">I haven&#39;t sorted that out, but it&#39;s something like you default to the simplest level that moves you to the next step</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.480" end="00:38:08.660" style="s2">you know, so for example... and generally that is what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.660" end="00:38:12.860" style="s2">if you&#39;re having an argument with someone that you have a long-term relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.860" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">you can start by arguing about what the little argument is about</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:21.500" style="s2">or you can immediately cascade into whether or not you should have a relationship with this person at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.500" end="00:38:26.260" style="s2">or even into whether or not you shoul even bother with relationships</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.260" end="00:38:33.080" style="s2">which is... you know, every time there&#39;s an argument, that question is a reasonable question to have emerge</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.080" end="00:38:36.060" style="s2">or at least it&#39;s in the realm of potential reasonable questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.060" end="00:38:43.940" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t seem useful to jump to the most catastrophic possible explanation every time some minor thing goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.940" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to people who have an anxiety disorder</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:51.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens to people who are depressed, right? they can&#39;t bind the anomaly</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.340" end="00:38:54.940" style="s2">and so what happens is it tends to propagate up the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.940" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">until it takes out their highest-order conceptualizations</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">you know, so if you&#39;re seriously depressed, maybe you&#39;ll watch a news article about something stupid, and you&#39;ll think: Jesus, why should I even be alive</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:06.960" style="s2">you know, and I&#39;m dead serious about that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.960" end="00:39:12.460" style="s2">if you score like 60 on the Beck depression inventory, which puts you way the hell up in the &quot;depressed&quot; range</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.460" end="00:39:17.860" style="s2">anything that happens to you that&#39;s negative will trigger suicidal thoughts, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.860" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">and sometimes even positive things will do it, because</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">there are very few positive things that happen, that don&#39;t carry with them some threat of change or transformation</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:32.080" style="s2">so, you know, one mystery, it&#39;s a big mystery</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.080" end="00:39:37.440" style="s2">why don&#39;t you fall into a catastrophic depression every time something little goes wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.440" end="00:39:41.580" style="s2">because the level of analysis is not self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.580" end="00:39:45.380" style="s2">you see this with people who are high in neuroticism too, you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:54.160" style="s2">their trivial fluctuations at their workplace or in their relationships or in their health</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.160" end="00:39:58.580" style="s2">will produce a very disproportionate negative emotional response</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.580" end="00:40:01.660" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the range of normal emotional responses</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.660" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">some people are very, very high in neuroticism, so everything upsets them, some people are very low</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:12.080" style="s2">and the reason that whole range exists is because sometimes you should get upset when some little thing happens to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.080" end="00:40:15.840" style="s2">&#39;cause it&#39;s an indication that the whole damn environment has got dangerous on you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.840" end="00:40:22.020" style="s2">and sometimes you should just brush it off, because it&#39;s net consequence is low</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.020" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">but, how do you calculate that? very, very difficult question</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.060" style="s2">so you know, when your computer goes wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.060" end="00:40:34.080" style="s2">well, you have to pick the proper level of analysis to fix it, and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.080" end="00:40:39.880" style="s2">you could say, well there&#39;s something wrong with the circuit board, and maybe there&#39;s a crack in one of the...</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.000" end="00:40:44.680" style="s2">somewhere that it&#39;s soldered, and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.680" end="00:40:51.420" style="s2">or you know, sometimes now that people are building microchips</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.420" end="00:40:54.520" style="s2">they&#39;ve run into a crazy problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.520" end="00:40:57.140" style="s2">you know, microchips keep getting smaller and smaller, right</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.140" end="00:41:01.220" style="s2">so the little wires now are down to atomic width</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">or you know, the width of maybe 20 atoms or something like that, but really, really... they&#39;re really getting thin</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:11.580" style="s2">and so, that produces another problem, which no one would have ever...</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.580" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t expect, and that is that at the quantum level there&#39;s uncertainty about where electrons might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">normally that doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">The degree of uncertainty where your electrons are, is smaller than your size so that it&#39;s basically irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">But down at the sub-atomic level where these microchips are starting to be produced</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.220" end="00:41:34.920" style="s2">Sometimes the electron will be outside the wires</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.920" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">and that means that they are getting so damn small that they&#39;ll get short-circuited by themselves</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">because the electrons aren&#39;t stable enough to be where they&#39;re supposed to be in the wires</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:44.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.400" end="00:41:48.160" style="s2">well, the reason I&#39;m pointing that out is because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.160" end="00:41:53.840" style="s2">a problem that exists in the system can exist at any of the multiple levels of that system</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.840" end="00:41:55.400" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t obvious where to start</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.400" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">and lot of political arguments are like that, you know...</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:07.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like maybe a company goes bankrupt and its shareholders get, maybe a bank fails, so maybe people can&#39;t withdraw their money</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.360" end="00:42:11.780" style="s2">One response is, well that just show you how rotten the capitalist system is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.780" end="00:42:16.120" style="s2">It&#39;s like, well, maybe that is what it shows, but</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.120" end="00:42:21.640" style="s2">it seems there is, it seems like that might not be the most appropriate level to start</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.640" end="00:42:25.560" style="s2">and so again, it&#39;s like Occam&#39;s Razor in the scientific world, right</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.560" end="00:42:29.000" style="s2">You want to use the simplest explanation that</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.000" end="00:42:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not that fits the facts</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.560" end="00:42:33.300" style="s2">because you don&#39;t organize your perception by facts</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.300" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like you want to use simplest tool you can possibly manage to fix the problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:42.800" style="s2">so you don&#39;t... when your car has a flat tire, you don&#39;t buy a new car</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.800" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">You fix the flat tire if you can figure out how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:53.160" style="s2">so you go for the thing that will put the tool back together with the minimum involvement of time and effort</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.160" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:43:00.200" style="s2">And you care about that because you have limited time and you have limited resources</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">And so it make sense for you to conserve them, and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.040" style="s2">I&#39;m telling you part for practical reasons too</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.040" end="00:43:10.320" style="s2">because this is a very useful thing to know</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.320" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re arguing with someone</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">you want to argue about the smallest possible thing that you could argue about that might fix the problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">you want to really specify what&#39;s going on at a micro level</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:27.800" style="s2">and what&#39;s the minimum that I would require to be satisfied with that outcome</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.800" end="00:43:31.880" style="s2">and if you&#39;re... This is especially true in intimate relationships. It&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.880" end="00:43:37.400" style="s2">If someone is bugging you and you want them to change, you think, well, how can I be minimally bothered by this</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.400" end="00:43:42.600" style="s2">and what&#39;s the tiniest amount of change I could request that might satisfy me</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.600" end="00:43:45.840" style="s2">cuz otherwise, the argument will come unglued</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.840" end="00:43:48.600" style="s2">and every time you guys try to discuss a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.600" end="00:43:50.920" style="s2">you&#39;ll talk about whether you should even be together</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.920" end="00:43:52.200" style="s2">and then you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.200" end="00:43:53.560" style="s2">cuz you&#39;ll never solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.560" end="00:43:56.840" style="s2">and then you won&#39;t be together, cuz you&#39;ll never solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.840" end="00:43:58.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.600" end="00:43:59.920" style="s2">ok</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:03.160" style="s2">so, here&#39;s the way to think about perception</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.160" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">so, let&#39;s say this is the thing you&#39;re trying to look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:10.120" style="s2">I call that the thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.120" end="00:44:13.840" style="s2">Now, that&#39;s schematic of a thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.840" end="00:44:19.720" style="s2">so, the thing in itself, that&#39;s an old philosophical concept and I think it came from Kant</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.720" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">But I&#39;m not sure about that. That might be older than that</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:29.400" style="s2">And the thing in itself is, what you could see if you could see everything about something, but…you can&#39;t…so it&#39;s a hypothetical entity</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.400" end="00:44:34.440" style="s2">and maybe, who knows, if I were looking at you like the thing in itself</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.440" end="00:44:42.280" style="s2">maybe I could see every level of your being, from the sub-atomic level, up to this level of perception then beyond</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.280" end="00:44:44.080" style="s2">I could see your family relationships</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.080" end="00:44:52.080" style="s2">I could see how they were nested in the societal relationships, economic relationships, political relationships, the eco-system as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.080" end="00:44:55.280" style="s2">like, I would see all those levels at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.280" end="00:44:57.400" style="s2">of course, I don&#39;t, cuz I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.400" end="00:44:59.680" style="s2">What I see instead is</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.680" end="00:45:06.320" style="s2">First of all, you are radically simplified by my senses because they are just not acute enough to see you at a microscopic level</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.320" end="00:45:10.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re not comprehensive enough to see your connections across time</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.120" end="00:45:12.920" style="s2">so, my senses filter a bunch of you from me right away</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.920" end="00:45:23.280" style="s2">and then, I&#39;m also filtered from you, by your willingness to act like I want while we were together</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.280" end="00:45:27.760" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s ... cuz you could be doing all sorts of strange things at the moment. But you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.760" end="00:45:36.200" style="s2">and so, you&#39;re helping me simplify my perception of you, by agreeing to play the same game that I&#39;m playing while we occupy the same space</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.200" end="00:45:37.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s basically politeness</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.560" end="00:45:39.900" style="s2">that&#39;s the mark of someone who&#39;s well socialized</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.900" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">you walk in somewhere you get the game play the game and you don&#39;t scare the hell out of everybody</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:50.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s…that&#39;s partly how we keep our emotions stabilized</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.820" end="00:45:54.300" style="s2">because you know if you&#39;re like a Freudian, you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.300" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">well, as long as your ego is well constituted, you can keep your emotions under control</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:03.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like, yes and no, mostly no</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.520" end="00:46:06.380" style="s2">I like the Piaget an idea better, which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.380" end="00:46:12.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re well socialized, you&#39;re awake enough to identify the game that&#39;s going on wherever you go</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.440" end="00:46:16.580" style="s2">and then you play that game immediately and so do all the other socialized primates</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.580" end="00:46:22.080" style="s2">and so then you can just understand the game you don&#39;t have to understand them, thank God</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.080" end="00:46:23.800" style="s2">you could just understand the game</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.800" end="00:46:27.760" style="s2">and as long as the game continues you don&#39;t have to be nervous, because you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.760" end="00:46:33.320" style="s2">you at least know what&#39;s going to happen and maybe you even know how to get what you want in that game</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.320" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">and so… so that again that&#39;s really worth thinking about, because</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:42.580" style="s2">we talked about this before about why people want to maintain their culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.580" end="00:46:48.580" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just because their culture is a belief system that helps them orient themselves in the world</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.580" end="00:46:54.600" style="s2">it&#39;s because I believe system is a game that everyone who shares that belief system is playing</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.600" end="00:46:58.980" style="s2">and the fact that everybody&#39;s playing means nobody needs to get upset</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.980" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">So it isn&#39;t like the belief system is directly inhibiting the emotions. That isn&#39;t how it works</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:08.180" style="s2">so… and it&#39;s not like the culture is just a belief system</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.180" end="00:47:10.660" style="s2">it&#39;s only secondarily a belief system, man</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.660" end="00:47:14.220" style="s2">mostly it&#39;s a game that people are actively engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.220" end="00:47:18.500" style="s2">that&#39;s way more important than the beliefs that go along with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.500" end="00:47:23.540" style="s2">you even need the damn beliefs you know that&#39;s why wolves can live with each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.540" end="00:47:27.260" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what the they&#39;ll have a belief system exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.260" end="00:47:31.420" style="s2">mostly they have a set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.420" end="00:47:34.120" style="s2">they have a game, that is the wolf game, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.120" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2">and all the wolves know how to play it, and, so, that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:40.360" style="s2">that&#39;s how they keep themselves organized in their packs</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.360" end="00:47:42.740" style="s2">a lot of its externalized</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.740" end="00:47:44.860" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.860" end="00:47:46.900" style="s2">okay, so, anyway, so,</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.900" end="00:47:53.700" style="s2">the thing in itself, that&#39;s a very complicated thing. It got multiple dimensions, multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.200" end="00:48:01.120" style="s2">and then it&#39;s worse than that because it doesn&#39;t only have multiple levels, but all those levels move across time</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.120" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">and every one of those level shifts as it moves across time</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:09.040" style="s2">and so I like to think of the thing in itself like a symphony</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.040" end="00:48:12.120" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a good model. I think that&#39;s why we like music, in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:19.800" style="s2">because music shows you a multi-level reality that unfolds and shifts across time, within some parameters, right? because</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.800" end="00:48:22.440" style="s2">it is not just chaos</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.440" end="00:48:27.820" style="s2">the music has an element of predictability and an element of unpredictability and it has these multiple levels</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.820" end="00:48:32.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of what everything in the world is like. It&#39;s what the world is like</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.540" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">so this is… a even that is just a conceptual model of the thing in itself first of all that&#39;s only got 2 dimensions instead of 3</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:42.140" style="s2">cuz it could be a cube</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.140" end="00:48:46.560" style="s2">and then it has… even a cube has 3 dimensions instead of 4, because</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.560" end="00:48:50.020" style="s2">if that was a cube, adding the third dimension</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.020" end="00:48:55.340" style="s2">then it would also be a cube that would transform and shift as it moved across time</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.340" end="00:48:58.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s what the thing in itself is but that&#39;s too damn complicated</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.340" end="00:49:01.980" style="s2">so then the question is when you look at it, what you see?</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.980" end="00:49:03.280" style="s2">and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.280" end="00:49:06.620" style="s2">to some degree, it depends on what you want to use it for</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.620" end="00:49:09.920" style="s2">and so I would say will hear look at the different ways you can look at this</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.920" end="00:49:11.260" style="s2">might say what is this</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.260" end="00:49:14.120" style="s2">somebody could say well it&#39;s a rectangle</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.120" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">and would you say that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.920" end="00:49:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s like, well</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.320" end="00:49:24.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not correct because there&#39;s not a one-to-one correspondence, but</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.020" end="00:49:29.220" style="s2">it might be a useful conceptualization if you think about that as a box</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.220" end="00:49:30.660" style="s2">it could contain that</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.660" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">and if you are carrying the box to only have to be concerned about the box and so that would be fine</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:37.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a good functional simplification</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.460" end="00:49:42.980" style="s2">that one&#39;s a little higher resolution because it says well yeah it&#39;s actually four rectangles</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.980" end="00:49:48.300" style="s2">and that one says, well, wait, think about that is an orchard that someone&#39;s looking at from the top</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.300" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">you want to figure out how to walk from South to North</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:53.220" style="s2">well, you got a little map there</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.220" end="00:49:58.460" style="s2">cuz you can think of those as bars instead of collections of dots</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.460" end="00:50:05.700" style="s2">Piaget showed the children will automatically do this. So for example if you take six dots and put them in a row</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.700" end="00:50:10.420" style="s2">and you take the same six dots and you stretch them out so the rows this much longer</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.420" end="00:50:15.960" style="s2">and then you asked the child where there are more dots, the child will say that there are more dots where it&#39;s longer</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.960" end="00:50:25.100" style="s2">because they&#39;re flipping in some sense between the perception of the individual dot, and the perception of the shape that the array of dots makes</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.100" end="00:50:27.960" style="s2">and so, the shape is longer, &#39;cause you could see it as a rectangle</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.960" end="00:50:33.880" style="s2">so they think, well, longer is bigger, bigger is more, there&#39;s gotta be more dots</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.180" end="00:50:40.760" style="s2">and then there&#39;s this one, which is sort of an amalgam of this one and this one, and then that one</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.760" end="00:50:47.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s the highest resolution model of that that&#39;s still a simplification</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.220" end="00:50:53.080" style="s2">and you know, what I like about this diagram is that, you know, people say, well...</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.080" end="00:50:57.020" style="s2">the facts are the facts, and what we&#39;re disagreeing about is our opinion about the facts</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.020" end="00:50:59.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like, no... yes...</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.940" end="00:51:06.980" style="s2">you have an opinion about the facts, but the world is so horribly complex that you can actually disagree about the facts themselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.980" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">and I think and ideology does that to people very commonly</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">so I saw this movie once that Naomi Klein made</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.840" style="s2">if I tell you the same story, tell me, &#39;cause I don&#39;t wanna tell you the same story, but I might</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.840" end="00:51:25.620" style="s2">so she went down to Argentina after a bunch of money had got out of Argentina beause of a financial collapse</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.620" end="00:51:30.620" style="s2">and she went to a factory that had been padlocked, and it was a heavy machinery factory</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.620" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">and the workers had decided they were gonna undo the padlocks and go build machines, you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.760" end="00:51:40.520" style="s2">to hell with the owner who shut it down!</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.520" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">and so, she went down and made this movie, and followed these workers around</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:49.560" style="s2">and showed how catastrophic their lives have been because they&#39;d lost their livelihood in this big financial crash</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.560" end="00:51:53.260" style="s2">and so that was really interesting; but then she went and interviewed the guy who owned the factory, and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.260" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">she treated him like he was... like a cipher in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:03.640" style="s2">instead of asking him: how he got the factory? what he wanted to do with it? how it fit in with his life plans?</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.640" end="00:52:07.380" style="s2">why he shut it down instead of continuing it?</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.380" end="00:52:14.100" style="s2">she didn&#39;t get the back story on him, she just left him in the &quot;evil capitalist&quot; box and went on with the film</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.100" end="00:52:19.000" style="s2">and it was... it wasn&#39;t like what she did wasn&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.000" end="00:52:26.020" style="s2">but it was only half true, and it was half true because she could perceive the complexity of the workers, having sympathy for them</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.020" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">but as far as she was concerned, the enemy, the owner had no complexity</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:34.540" style="s2">he was just &quot;bad capitalist&quot;, and that how it was left in the movie</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.540" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">I found it profoundly unsatisfying, because I wanted to know, okay, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:44.580" style="s2">you know that these workers are suffering, it&#39;s not self-evident that you want your damn factory closed</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.580" end="00:52:47.600" style="s2">you&#39;d think you&#39;d want it open so you could be building things, it&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.600" end="00:52:52.140" style="s2">who are you? what are you doing? why is is this justifiable? have a question about it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.140" end="00:52:57.160" style="s2">well, you can take this infinite set of facts</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.160" end="00:53:03.940" style="s2">and then you subject it to your filters, and you let some of the facts through, and they&#39;re facts</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.940" end="00:53:07.080" style="s2">but what about all the facts that you don&#39;t let through?</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.080" end="00:53:10.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing, and that&#39;s what the gorilla video shows, too</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.380" end="00:53:14.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like, yeah, yeah, you&#39;ve got the basketball count right, but you missed the big primate</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.480" end="00:53:18.900" style="s2">and you might say, well, your priorities were a bit skewed in that circumstance, because</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.900" end="00:53:24.700" style="s2">you were rearranging the deck chairs as the Titanic sank, as the old joke goes</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.700" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very much useful to think always, well, you&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:32.920" style="s2">it isn&#39;t just your damn opinion that&#39;s biased, although it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.920" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">it&#39;s your perceptions that are biased, so...</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:42.700" style="s2">[???] it&#39;s even more, so you say, well</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.700" end="00:53:48.500" style="s2">you can&#39;t see the thing in itself &#39;cause it&#39;s too complex, so you perceive it simpler than it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.500" end="00:53:53.240" style="s2">and some of that perceptual simplification is dependent on your aims</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.240" end="00:54:00.460" style="s2">so that&#39;s a vicious one, because it pulls the value structure that you&#39;re ensconced within into your perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.460" end="00:54:03.280" style="s2">it pulls it into the reals of facts itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.280" end="00:54:10.040" style="s2">and then you do another... I think about this as a compression</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.040" end="00:54:14.820" style="s2">you can compress a photograph by getting rid of redundant information</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.820" end="00:54:17.820" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of what you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.820" end="00:54:23.900" style="s2">one of these squares, little black squares here, black rectangles, compresses all of those</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.000" end="00:54:29.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like we&#39;re going to treat those as if they&#39;re greyish black, same thing happens here</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.640" end="00:54:36.360" style="s2">so we&#39;re blurring across them, so we have a much less high-resolution image here</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.360" end="00:54:41.260" style="s2">so you take the thing in itself, you perceive it as a low-resolution representation</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.260" end="00:54:46.040" style="s2">and then you take that low-resolution representation and you replace that with a word</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.040" end="00:54:50.480" style="s2">and so the word is a twofold compression</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.480" end="00:54:56.900" style="s2">and then when someone tosses you the word, you unpack it into a low-resolution perception</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.900" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">and then maybe into the world itself, if you can do that, but probably not</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:04.920" style="s2">so that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, we&#39;re taking the complex world, we fold it into a simple perception</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.920" end="00:55:08.900" style="s2">we fold that into a word, we throw the word to someone else, and they unpack it</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.900" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">and the only way you can unpack it, of course, is if you&#39;d had enough similar experience so that you have the reference for the word already in your experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:21.220" style="s2">which is why you have to use simplified language with children, right, because</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.220" end="00:55:27.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no point tossing a child a concept  that he or she can&#39;t unpack</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.880" end="00:55:36.380" style="s2">so we compress a very complex reality through a very, very small keyhole</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.380" end="00:55:39.720" style="s2">that&#39;s basically our cognitive process</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.720" end="00:55:44.720" style="s2">okay, so then here&#39;s the next kinda argument, this goes along with...</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.720" end="00:55:51.420" style="s2">the science-religion argument that I was making earlier, which I wanna unpack a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.420" end="00:56:00.900" style="s2">I think that fundamentalists and atheistic scientists have the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.900" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">the fundamentalists, so we can say the christian fundamentalists in the US</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:12.360" style="s2">make the proposition that biblical stories, we&#39;ll call them mythological stories</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.360" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">are literal representations of the truth, but... and...</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:20.640" style="s2">that might be true depending on what you mean by &quot;literal&quot; ;)</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.640" end="00:56:27.020" style="s2">but what they mean by &quot;literal&quot;, or what they attempt to make &quot;literal&quot; mean, is that they&#39;re in the same category, as scientific facts</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.020" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have the idea that there are different ways of approaching truth</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:40.820" style="s2">and that truths can serve different purposes; they don&#39;t have the sense that your definition of &quot;truth&quot; is actually something like a tool</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.820" end="00:56:44.200" style="s2">rather than an ontological statement about the reality of the world</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.200" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">and so the  fundamentalists basically make the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:55.000" style="s2">the idea that God created the world in six days, five thousand years ago is literally true</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.000" end="00:56:58.540" style="s2">and they get the five thousand year estimate, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.540" end="00:57:03.320" style="s2">by going through the genealogies on the Old Testament, and adding up the hypothetical ages, and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.320" end="00:57:11.160" style="s2">how long before Moses Adam lived, and some bishop did that, I think it was in the mid-1800s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.160" end="00:57:14.240" style="s2">I might be wrong about that, but it was somewhere back about that time</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:18.800" style="s2">and more or less that&#39;s been accepted as canonical fact ever since</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.800" end="00:57:23.200" style="s2">and then the scientists say: well yeah, those are empirical truths, they&#39;re just wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.200" end="00:57:26.900" style="s2">see, and that&#39;s the only difference there is between the fundamentalists and the atheist scientists</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.900" end="00:57:31.140" style="s2">the fundamentalists say: those are fundamental scientific truths, and they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.140" end="00:57:36.380" style="s2">and the scientists say: well, they&#39;re scientific truths, they just happen to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.380" end="00:57:39.660" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a stupid argument, presonally</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.660" end="00:57:42.420" style="s2">for a bunch of reasons, one is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.420" end="00:57:50.660" style="s2">the people who wrote the ancient stories that we have access to were - in no way, shape or form - scientists</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.660" end="00:57:55.660" style="s2">you know, modern people tend to think that you think like a scientist, and people have always thought that way</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.660" end="00:57:58.220" style="s2">first of all, you do not think like a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.220" end="00:58:00.680" style="s2">even scientists hardly even think like scientists</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.680" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">but if you&#39;re not scientifically trained, you don&#39;t think like a scientist at all</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:09.660" style="s2">so one of the things, for example, that characterizes your thinking is confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.660" end="00:58:14.900" style="s2">so if you have a theory, what you do is wander around in the world, looking for reasons why it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.900" end="00:58:17.940" style="s2">and a scientist does exactly the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.940" end="00:58:22.840" style="s2">in the little tiny, narrow domain where he or she is actually capable of being a scientist</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.840" end="00:58:26.360" style="s2">and what they have is a theory, and look for a way to prove it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.360" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">but, believe me, you don&#39;t run around doing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:31.960" style="s2">you can train yourself so now and then you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.960" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">you can learn to listen to people, for example, on the off chance that you might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:39.800" style="s2">but that is by no means a natural way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.800" end="00:58:47.400" style="s2">and of course, the fundamental philosophical axioms of the scientific method</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.400" end="00:58:53.420" style="s2">weren&#39;t developed until Descartes and Bacon, and who else...?</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.420" end="00:58:57.460" style="s2">there&#39;s one more... anyways, the name escapes me at the moment, but</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.460" end="00:59:06.380" style="s2">you can argue when science emerged, but it&#39;s certainly emerged in its articulated form in the last thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.380" end="00:59:11.360" style="s2">I think you could say even more specifically that it emerged in the last five hudred years</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.360" end="00:59:17.480" style="s2">now, you might argue with that, and say: what about the Greeks and other people who were fairly technologically sophisticated?</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.480" end="00:59:20.140" style="s2">or who invented geometry or that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.140" end="00:59:25.100" style="s2">but yeah, yeah, bare precursors to the idea of empirical observation</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.100" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">Aristotle, for example, when he was writing down his knowledge of the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:34.080" style="s2">it never occurred to him to actually go out in the world and look at it to see if what he assumed about it was true</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.080" end="00:59:37.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s certainly never occurred to Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.720" end="00:59:41.700" style="s2">to get 20 people to go look at the same thing independently</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.700" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">write down exactly how they went about doing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:47.520" style="s2">compare the records, and then extract out what was common</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.520" end="00:59:53.540" style="s2">and that&#39;s a... that seems self-evident to us to some degree, but, you know...</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.540" end="00:59:58.300" style="s2">it was by no means self-evident to anyone five hundred years ago, and people still don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.300" end="01:00:03.260" style="s2">so it&#39;s not plausible...</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.260" end="01:00:08.200" style="s2">if you know anything about the history of ideas, it&#39;s not plusible to posit that</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.200" end="01:00:12.760" style="s2">stories about the nature of reality that existed before 500 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.760" end="01:00:16.760" style="s2">were scientific in any but the most cursory of ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.760" end="01:00:21.100" style="s2">so why we have that argument continually is somewhat beyond me</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.100" end="01:00:29.180" style="s2">part of the reason is, though, that everyone, fundamentalists included, really believe in scientific facts</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.180" end="01:00:36.340" style="s2">even though they hate it; they&#39;ll use conputers, they&#39;ll fly; computer&#39;s wouldn&#39;t work unless quantum mechanics were correct</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.340" end="01:00:45.560" style="s2">the fact that you use a high-tech device indicates through your action that you actually accept the theories upon which it&#39;s predicated</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.560" end="01:00:50.800" style="s2">right, the same as flying, same as anything you do in a complex technological society</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.800" end="01:00:54.780" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck with it; you&#39;re reading by the lights; do they work? yeah, they work</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.780" end="01:00:59.200" style="s2">well, so it&#39;s really hard for people who are trying to hold onto</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.200" end="01:01:04.980" style="s2">a way of looking at the world that appears to contradict the scientific claims</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.980" end="01:01:09.720" style="s2">when everything they do is predicated on their acceptance of the validity of the scientific claims</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.720" end="01:01:12.300" style="s2">it&#39;s really problematic for people</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.300" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s problematic in a real way, I think, because</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:20.460" style="s2">one of the problems with the scientific viewpoint is it doesn&#39;t tell you anything about what you should do with your life</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.460" end="01:01:24.660" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t solve the problem of value at all</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.660" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">in fact, it might make it more difficult, because</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:33.460" style="s2">one of the fundamental scientific claims, roughly speaking, is that every fact is of equal utility</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.460" end="01:01:38.180" style="s2">at least from a scientific perspective; there&#39;s no hierarchy of facts</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.180" end="01:01:44.920" style="s2">that&#39;s not exactly true, because you can think of one theory as &quot;more true&quot; than another</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.920" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">but that boils down to saying that it&#39;s more useful than another</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:50.820" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a really good exception</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.820" end="01:01:53.240" style="s2">okay, so fine</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.240" end="01:01:57.720" style="s2">you got the scientific atheists on one end and you got the religious fundamentalists on the other</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.720" end="01:02:01.600" style="s2">and what they both agree on, whether they like it or not, is that</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.600" end="01:02:07.000" style="s2">there&#39;s so much power in the scientific method that it&#39;s difficult to dispute the validity of scientific facts</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.000" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">and they seem to exist in contradiction to the older, archaic stories</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:17.100" style="s2">if you also accept them as fact-based accounts</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.100" end="01:02:21.460" style="s2">so what do we do about that? well, if you&#39;re on the scientific atheist end of things</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.460" end="01:02:25.520" style="s2">you say: well, those old stories are just superstitious science</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.520" end="01:02:30.860" style="s2">second-rate, barbaric, archaic forms of science; you just dispense with them, they&#39;re nothing but trouble</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.860" end="01:02:36.520" style="s2">and if you&#39;re on the fundamentalist side, you say: well we&#39;ll try to shoehorn science into this framework</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.520" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">and really that doesn&#39;t work very well; it doesn&#39;t work very well with the claims of evolution, for example</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:47.680" style="s2">in fact, it works very badly, and that&#39;s a problem, because evolutionary theory is like... it&#39;s a killer theory</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.680" end="01:02:51.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really, really hard...</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.060" end="01:02:57.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s not a complete theory, and there&#39;s lots of things we don&#39;t know about evolution, but... you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.320" end="01:03:05.200" style="s2">trying to handwave that away, that&#39;s not gonna work without dispensing with most of biology</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.200" end="01:03:11.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s a big problem; so here&#39;s another way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.700" end="01:03:15.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t just need one way of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.300" end="01:03:21.960" style="s2">maybe you need two ways of looking at the world, and I&#39;m not exactly sure how they should be related to one another</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.960" end="01:03:25.000" style="s2">like which should take precedence under which circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.000" end="01:03:29.100" style="s2">but one problem is: what&#39;s the world made of?</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.100" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">you know, what&#39;s the world, conceptualized as an objective place, made of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:38.280" style="s2">and the other is: how should you conduct yourself while you&#39;re alive?</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.280" end="01:03:46.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s no reason to assume that those questions can be answered using the same approach</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.120" end="01:03:53.380" style="s2">I mean, physics has its methods, chemistry has its methods, and biology has its methods</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.380" end="01:03:59.140" style="s2">so a method for obtaining the truth can be bound to a domain</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.140" end="01:04:03.820" style="s2">so why would we necessarily assume that you could use the same set of tools</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.820" end="01:04:10.420" style="s2">to represent the world as a place of objects, and to represent as a place in which a biological creature would act?</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.420" end="01:04:15.020" style="s2">I mean, anyways, I&#39;m suggesting that we...</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.020" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">that we don&#39;t view it that way, that we have two different viewpoints</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:23.600" style="s2">maybe they can be brought together, although it&#39;s not obvious how</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.600" end="01:04:29.080" style="s2">but that it&#39;s not a tenable solution to get rid of one in favor of the other</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.080" end="01:04:33.580" style="s2">and I think the reason for that is that...</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.580" end="01:04:36.860" style="s2">you need to know how to conduct yourself in the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.860" end="01:04:41.960" style="s2">you have to have a value system, you can&#39;t even look at the damn world with out a value system</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.960" end="01:04:49.460" style="s2">it&#39;s not possible; your emotional health is dependent on a value system, the way you interact with other people is dependent on a value system</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.460" end="01:04:51.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no getting away from it</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.880" end="01:04:56.900" style="s2">and you say, well, there&#39;s no justification for any value system from a scientific perspective</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.900" end="01:05:01.720" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna draw that conclusion that no value system is valid, where the hell does that leave you?</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.720" end="01:05:07.100" style="s2">there&#39;s no down, there&#39;s no up, there&#39;s no rationale for moving in any direction</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.100" end="01:05:09.100" style="s2">there&#39;s not even really any rationale for living</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.100" end="01:05:14.600" style="s2">and so people say things like: well, why the hell should I care what happens, in a million years who&#39;s gonna know the difference?</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.600" end="01:05:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like, yeah, yeah, true. stupid, but true</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.360" end="01:05:23.260" style="s2">and the reason I think it&#39;s stupid is because it&#39;s just a game, you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.260" end="01:05:27.420" style="s2">I can take anything of any sort and find a context in which it&#39;s irrelevant</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.420" end="01:05:30.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just a rational game, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.600" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">who cares if a hundred children freeze to death in a blizzard? what difference is it gonna make in a billion years?</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:41.720" style="s2">well, what do you say to someone who says that? you say, well, seems like the wrong frame of reference, bucko</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.720" end="01:05:49.620" style="s2">that&#39;s what it looks like to me; you know, &#39;cause at some point you question the damn frame of reference, not what you derive from it</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.620" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">and it certainly seems to me that situations like that don&#39;t allow you to use that kind of frame of reference, there&#39;s something inhumane about it</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:01.140" style="s2">and that trumps the logic, or at least it should</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.140" end="01:06:05.240" style="s2">and if it doesn&#39;t, then all hell breaks loose, and that doesn&#39;t seem to be a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.240" end="01:06:08.940" style="s2">okay, so I have this quote from Shakespeare here</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.940" end="01:06:16.860" style="s2">he says: all the world&#39;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in time plays many parts</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.860" end="01:06:22.820" style="s2">well, it&#39;s the sort of thing that you&#39;d expect a dramatist to pen, but that&#39;s how he looked at the world</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.820" end="01:06:30.100" style="s2">and we still watch Shakespeare&#39;s plays some hundreds of years later because there seems to be something essential captured in them</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.100" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">something about how people do act, but more importantly, I think, how people should and shouldn&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:42.580" style="s2">because what fun is it going to a play that doesn&#39;t outline how someone should and shouldn&#39;t act?</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.580" end="01:06:48.060" style="s2">you want a good guy or a couple of them, maybe they can be complex interminglings of good and bad</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.060" end="01:06:50.060" style="s2">you know, that makes it more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.060" end="01:06:59.360" style="s2">and you want a bad guy or a bad... you always want to see that contract either within a character or between characters</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.360" end="01:07:03.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s because you want to know how to live properly, that&#39;s how to be a good person</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.620" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">and you wanna know how to live improperly, how to be a bad person, so you can watch out for people like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:14.300" style="s2">or so you can figure out what that means for yourself; it&#39;s compelling</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.300" end="01:07:19.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s another thing that&#39;s worth thinking about:</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.720" end="01:07:22.120" style="s2">why is it compelling?</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.120" end="01:07:29.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s compelling to everyone, and that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so cool, is that there aren&#39;t that many phenomena that you can point to that are compelling to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.060" end="01:07:36.180" style="s2">music is close, it&#39;s a very rare person who doesn&#39;t like at least some genre of music, no matter how narrow</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.180" end="01:07:43.420" style="s2">but the other one is stories, you&#39;re hard pressed to find someone, especially if they&#39;re younger, who doesn&#39;t like stories</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.420" end="01:07:48.620" style="s2">why? is it a waste of time? or is there something going on?</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.620" end="01:07:50.620" style="s2">well...</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.620" end="01:07:57.080" style="s2">i think it&#39;s not only not a waste of time, it&#39;s actually the most fundamentally important thing you can possibly do</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.080" end="01:08:03.100" style="s2">because there&#39;s no difference between understanding stories and figuring out how to get along in the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.100" end="01:08:10.780" style="s2">so, and there&#39;s a tight relationship between the story that you inhabit, that structures your behavior</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.780" end="01:08:14.840" style="s2">and the games that Piaget talked about, that organize people&#39;s behavior,</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.840" end="01:08:20.340" style="s2">to some degree the reason we can all sit in this room together like this</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.340" end="01:08:26.780" style="s2">is because a huge chunk of the value system that guides our behavior is shared</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.780" end="01:08:33.200" style="s2">so I&#39;m lecturing and you&#39;re sitting in the classroom, and that distinguishes us to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.200" end="01:08:37.140" style="s2">but you know that that&#39;s partly merely a consequence of the difference in our age</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.140" end="01:08:43.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the same trajectory, we just happen to occupy different positions in a value hierarchy that we both accept</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.160" end="01:08:48.220" style="s2">and so, as long as you feel that that&#39;s fair and just, then you&#39;re not gonna object to it, but</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.220" end="01:08:51.960" style="s2">I&#39;m here in the classroom for many of the same reasons that you&#39;re here in the classroom</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.960" end="01:08:56.680" style="s2">if you look at the higher-order parts of the value structure, and maybe right at the end of that...</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.680" end="01:09:03.700" style="s2">&#39;cause I&#39;ve tried to figure out if you push why you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing right now to its ultimate limit</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.700" end="01:09:07.080" style="s2">so you can&#39;t get a story that&#39;s superordinate to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.080" end="01:09:13.060" style="s2">it&#39;s something like, well, you belive that the investigation of the world to acquire knowledge is worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.060" end="01:09:15.340" style="s2">otherwise what the hell are you here for?</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.340" end="01:09:20.980" style="s2">and even if 80% of your motivation is to get a good, stable job, fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.980" end="01:09:22.980" style="s2">there&#39;s still something outside of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.980" end="01:09:28.120" style="s2">because the whole culture says, well, you&#39;re more likely to be able to function properly in a good, stable job</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.120" end="01:09:33.320" style="s2">if you&#39;re the sort of person who knows how to go out in the world and forage for information usefully</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.320" end="01:09:36.480" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s very much analogous to the hero story</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.480" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">it&#39;s like, you go out and you search the unknown to find something of value</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:43.980" style="s2">and so fundamentally that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing in the classroom</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.980" end="01:09:49.960" style="s2">and the reason we can all organize our behavior is because we accept that framework consciously...</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.960" end="01:09:53.160" style="s2">consciously would be: we know how to articulate it</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.160" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">unconsciously it&#39;s: well, it doesn&#39;t matter, we know how to act out the patterns</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:00.920" style="s2">whether we can say the rules or not, doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.920" end="01:10:11.000" style="s2">same as a wolf pack; we know the procedures, and you could describe them with an articulated value structure</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.900" end="01:10:15.900" style="s2">let&#39;s take a break</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.900" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">okay, so let&#39;s go back to the complexity problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:25.220" style="s2">you see, I actually think in some sense that&#39;s the fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.220" end="01:10:30.060" style="s2">when you read about the terror management theorist types</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.060" end="01:10:33.140" style="s2">they think that death is the fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.140" end="01:10:40.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s a good argument, because it&#39;s definitely a fundamental problem, but I think it&#39;s a subset of the complexity problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.300" end="01:10:47.420" style="s2">and the reason I think that is because sometimes people&#39;s lives become so complex that they&#39;d rather be dead</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.420" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">and the reason they seek death through suicide is to make the complexity go away</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">&#39;cause complexity causes suffering if it&#39;s uncontrolled</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:10:59.780" style="s2">you know, things just get beyond your control</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.780" end="01:11:04.360" style="s2">and that can happen, you know, if you&#39;re hit by three or four catastrophes at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.360" end="01:11:10.240" style="s2">you know, maybe you have... oh, the political system collapses, there&#39;s hyperinflation</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.240" end="01:11:16.820" style="s2">you lose your job, and you have someone that you love or two people die, and maybe you get cancer, something like that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.820" end="01:11:23.240" style="s2">those things happen to people, and they just think, well, there&#39;s no getting out of this, it&#39;s just too much</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.240" end="01:11:27.780" style="s2">and you know, one of the interesting things about being a psychologist is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.780" end="01:11:34.680" style="s2">what you learn if you&#39;re gonna be a psychologist is that people come to you with mental illnesses - and that&#39;s almost never true</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.680" end="01:11:38.980" style="s2">people come to you, because their lives are so damn complicated, they cannot stay on top of them</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.980" end="01:11:43.180" style="s2">in any way that doesn&#39;t make it look like they&#39;re just gonna get more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.180" end="01:11:46.380" style="s2">and so then that causes symptoms, you know it&#39;s like...</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.380" end="01:11:51.080" style="s2">there&#39;s this old idea, a sort of a metaphor for genetic susceptibility</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.080" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">take a balloon and blow it up until it&#39;s beyond its tolerance - it&#39;s going to blow out at the weakest point</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:58.380" style="s2">well that&#39;s sort of what a genetic susceptibility is</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.380" end="01:12:03.900" style="s2">if I just keep adding complexity on top of you, at some point you&#39;ll blow out at your weakest point</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.900" end="01:12:07.220" style="s2">you know, maybe you&#39;ll get physiologically ill, maybe you&#39;ll start drinking</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.220" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll develop an anxiety disorder, maybe you&#39;ll get OCD, maybe you&#39;ll get depressed</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.380" style="s2">whatever, they&#39;ll be something about you that&#39;s the weakest point</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.380" end="01:12:17.260" style="s2">and if I just push, that&#39;s where you&#39;ll blow out, so</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.260" end="01:12:21.140" style="s2">that&#39;s a mental illness, but those things almost never just happen</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.140" end="01:12:26.220" style="s2">sometimes, but not very often, usually people have just been hammered like two or three different ways</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.220" end="01:12:31.120" style="s2">and then they collapse in the direction of their biological weakness, and</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.120" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">then maybe you put them back together, but</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:38.300" style="s2">it&#39;s almost always a complexity-related phenomenon rather than a mental illness-related phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.300" end="01:12:40.540" style="s2">not always, but almost always</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.540" end="01:12:42.980" style="s2">okay, so now</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.980" end="01:12:47.940" style="s2">you got this complexity problem, and you think: well, you deal with it conceptually</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.940" end="01:12:54.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of akin to the idea that it&#39;s belief systems that protect you from death anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.940" end="01:12:59.300" style="s2">the ideas are roughly comparable, but again, that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.300" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the sort of thing only a psychologist could think up</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:07.520" style="s2">because psychologists think that everything about you happens inside your head, so to speak, in your psyche, but that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.520" end="01:13:11.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge chunk of you that&#39;s outside of you completely</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.040" end="01:13:16.760" style="s2">and so, this is a really good example, like, we know the oldest cities, this is a medieval city in France</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.760" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">a beautiful old city</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">old cities were walled, and the reason for that was because</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:28.280" style="s2">they were places of wealth, and if you didn&#39;t put walls around them then</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.280" end="01:13:31.580" style="s2">other people would come in and steal everything and kill you</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.580" end="01:13:34.560" style="s2">so having some walls was a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.560" end="01:13:37.900" style="s2">the same as having walls in your house is a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.900" end="01:13:43.280" style="s2">walls between your rooms are a good idea, or borders between categories are a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.280" end="01:13:50.640" style="s2">and so, part of the way you simplify the world is by building walls around your space, because then a whole bunch of things can&#39;t come in</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.640" end="01:13:54.980" style="s2">and so, you don&#39;t even have to think about them; it&#39;s not conceptual, it&#39;s practical</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.980" end="01:13:59.440" style="s2">and so, and you know, one of the things I think I&#39;ve figured out recently</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.440" end="01:14:02.820" style="s2">is the fundamental political difference between people</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.820" end="01:14:06.480" style="s2">and it looks to me like the fundamental political difference, is:</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.480" end="01:14:09.800" style="s2">how many walls should there be around your stuff?</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.800" end="01:14:13.100" style="s2">and the ultimate liberal answer is: zero</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.100" end="01:14:17.660" style="s2">and the ultimate conservative answer is: bring on those walls, man!</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.660" end="01:14:20.760" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about both those perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.760" end="01:14:25.320" style="s2">first of all is that there&#39;s temperamental contributions to them, and second that they&#39;re both valid</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.320" end="01:14:33.940" style="s2">so one of the mysteries, I believe, that permeates psychometric psychology right now is</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.940" end="01:14:40.300" style="s2">why the temperamental factors that influence politics are those particular temperamental factors</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.300" end="01:14:46.300" style="s2">so there&#39;s five, let&#39;s say, right, there&#39;s classic Big 5: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.300" end="01:14:52.240" style="s2">well, the biggest predictors of political allegiance, forget about the politically correct types for a minute</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.240" end="01:14:58.080" style="s2">but on the liberal to conservative axis is that the liberals are low in conscientiousness and high in openness</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.080" end="01:15:01.220" style="s2">and the conservatives are high in conscientiousness and low in openness</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.220" end="01:15:04.980" style="s2">and so then you think, well, why those two traits? that&#39;s the first question</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.980" end="01:15:08.160" style="s2">and the second question is: why those two traits together?</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.160" end="01:15:12.180" style="s2">given that they&#39;re not very highly correlated, right, they&#39;re really quite independent</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.180" end="01:15:15.100" style="s2">so why do they co-vary on the political axis?</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.100" end="01:15:18.500" style="s2">and I think this is the reason, I think it&#39;s exaclty that</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.500" end="01:15:23.420" style="s2">open people like to live on the periphery of boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.420" end="01:15:27.500" style="s2">and they like to break boundaries between things, &#39;cause interesting things happen when you...</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.500" end="01:15:31.340" style="s2">when you think a different way, when you think outside of the box, so to speak</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.340" end="01:15:36.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what open people do, they always think outside of the box, no matter what box you put them in</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.040" end="01:15:40.680" style="s2">you know, and sometimes you meet people that are so open that they&#39;re completely disorganized</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.680" end="01:15:46.340" style="s2">their thought process is almost completely associational, like a dreamer they just jump from one thing to another</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.340" end="01:15:50.260" style="s2">they&#39;re very interesting to talk to, it&#39;s very hard for those people to get their lives together</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.260" end="01:15:55.100" style="s2">&#39;cause they&#39;re interested in absolutely everything, and their attention just flits all over the place</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.100" end="01:15:59.380" style="s2">and so they&#39;re open, and that actually does go along with higher intelligence, generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.380" end="01:16:04.260" style="s2">so, and then if they&#39;re low in conscientiousness, they don&#39;t see any utility in order</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.260" end="01:16:11.700" style="s2">and orderly people... &#39;cause that&#39;s part of conscientiousness, and the biggest determiner of political belief in the conscientious domain</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.700" end="01:16:17.040" style="s2">the orderly people like to have everything in its separate place and properly structured</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.040" end="01:16:22.000" style="s2">and so their world is box inside a box, inside a shelf of boxes</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.000" end="01:16:26.920" style="s2">and then that shelf of boxes is inside another box, and all those boxes are nice and neat and tight</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.920" end="01:16:30.820" style="s2">and nothing inside them is touching, and everything in every box is the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.820" end="01:16:35.020" style="s2">and you know, you can see that... you can see the utility in that</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.020" end="01:16:40.140" style="s2">that, as far as we&#39;ve been able to tell is also associated with disgust sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.140" end="01:16:46.340" style="s2">and people are disgusted, generally speaking, when things that shouldn&#39;t be touching, are touching</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.340" end="01:16:49.500" style="s2">like something horrible stuck to you, for example</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.500" end="01:16:52.800" style="s2">that produces a very visceral sense of disgust</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.800" end="01:16:59.020" style="s2">and it&#39;s a boundary violation, &#39;cause that&#39;s what disgust is, it indexes a boundary violation</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.020" end="01:17:06.280" style="s2">and you can... how separate people should be from one another as individuals or in groups</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.280" end="01:17:08.740" style="s2">is an entirely debatable issue</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.740" end="01:17:12.340" style="s2">because there&#39;s huge advantages when people mingle and mix</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.340" end="01:17:16.260" style="s2">and there&#39;s huge dangers when people mingle and mix, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.260" end="01:17:19.980" style="s2">at some point you say, well, the danger are overwhelming the positives</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.980" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">and at another point you say, well the positives are overwhelming the dangers</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:29.220" style="s2">and you have a continual argument about that with your self, but more importantly with people who have different temperament than you</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.220" end="01:17:36.600" style="s2">and the terrible temptation is to assume that only those people who have your temperament are correct</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.600" end="01:17:41.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s just... those other temperaments wouldn&#39;t exist if that was true</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.500" end="01:17:45.900" style="s2">if you look at it from a strictly biological perspective</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.900" end="01:17:51.020" style="s2">so anyways, one of the things we do to simplify the world is to frame it</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.020" end="01:17:55.480" style="s2">physically - and so you look at this, you&#39;ve got wall number 1, and then you have wall number 2</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.480" end="01:17:58.540" style="s2">but then inside the walls you have walls around everything</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.540" end="01:18:02.740" style="s2">all these houses are walls, and inside the houses there are walls as well</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.740" end="01:18:04.360" style="s2">and so everything is...</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.360" end="01:18:09.180" style="s2">and what you do when you put walls around things is you make part of the worlds simpler, constantly</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.180" end="01:18:15.740" style="s2">the reason you have a house is so that everybody and his dog isn&#39;t in your house</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.740" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">you just want those few people that you can barely tolerate in your house</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:22.580" style="s2">and not all those other strangers, God only knows what they&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.580" end="01:18:28.320" style="s2">you&#39;ll still invite people in now and then, beause maybe you&#39;re sick and tired and bored of the people that are in your house</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.320" end="01:18:30.860" style="s2">and so you want a little bit of new information, but</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.860" end="01:18:37.300" style="s2">you want those barriers to be there so that you can voluntarily modulate the information flow</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.300" end="01:18:39.300" style="s2">okay, so that&#39;s the first thing you do</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.300" end="01:18:42.400" style="s2">then you set up rules with everybody else that says, well:</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.400" end="01:18:45.080" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have some walls, so you can&#39;t come in, but</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.080" end="01:18:51.040" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna do is pay you for that privilege by letting you have some walls where people can&#39;t come in</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.040" end="01:18:54.400" style="s2">and so, I think that&#39;s analogous... I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.400" end="01:18:57.980" style="s2">the issue of discrimination in relationship to sex</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.980" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">because I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about discrimination lately, because everybody thinks discrimination is a bad idea</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.960" end="01:19:07.480" style="s2">which is a very stupid proposition, because you&#39;re discruminating all the time</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.480" end="01:19:11.780" style="s2">and the most fundamental form of discrimination is choice of sexual partner</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.780" end="01:19:14.760" style="s2">and so you might say, well, why should that even be allowed?</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.760" end="01:19:17.420" style="s2">because it is the most fundamental form of</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.420" end="01:19:22.920" style="s2">so for example, almost everyone is racially prejudiced when it comes to sexual partners</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.920" end="01:19:27.080" style="s2">so you think, well... what about... are you...</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.080" end="01:19:30.820" style="s2">do you use age as an exclusionary criteria? probably</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.820" end="01:19:35.060" style="s2">do you use physical attractiveness? only insofar as you&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.060" end="01:19:38.840" style="s2">right? you&#39;d use it completely if you could get away with it, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.840" end="01:19:43.100" style="s2">but you can&#39;t, because the most attractive people aren&#39;t gonna be anywhere near you</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.100" end="01:19:45.140" style="s2">so you can&#39;t do it, but you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.140" end="01:19:50.880" style="s2">health? yes, strenght? yes, wealth? yes, education? definitely</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.880" end="01:19:54.240" style="s2">so it&#39;s unbelievably discriminatory</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.240" end="01:20:00.260" style="s2">so you might say, well, why is that justifiable? and it seems to me that it&#39;s something like...</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.260" end="01:20:05.920" style="s2">well, you get to say &quot;no&quot; to me if I get to say &quot;no&quot; to you, it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.920" end="01:20:12.780" style="s2">we&#39;ve agreed that everybody gets to discriminate on that basis, and because everybody can do it, then it&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.780" end="01:20:16.460" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that, it&#39;s very much worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.460" end="01:20:20.380" style="s2">you know, I don&#39;t know if you know this, but in Huxley&#39;s book, Brave New World</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.380" end="01:20:29.380" style="s2">where the family had been completely demolished, right, and children were conceived in bottles and produced in factories</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.380" end="01:20:34.620" style="s2">the whole idea of the relationship between sex and procreation had become a taboo</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.620" end="01:20:41.840" style="s2">one of the mantras, slogans of the society, was: &quot;Everyone belongs to everyone else.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.840" end="01:20:47.480" style="s2">and so, it was actually a social  faux-pas to refuse to sleep with someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.480" end="01:20:51.900" style="s2">just as it was a social faux-pas to have any exclusionary relationship</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.900" end="01:20:57.680" style="s2">because another thing you might notice is that there&#39;s nothing more discriminatory than falling in love with someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.680" end="01:21:02.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like: you&#39;re special! and all the rest of you? haha no</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.280" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s the ultimate exclusionary act, right, and we presume that that&#39;s an acceptable...</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:15.480" style="s2">not only acceptable, we demand that as a right; and that&#39;s worth thinking about a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.480" end="01:21:18.540" style="s2">anyways, okay, so what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.540" end="01:21:23.320" style="s2">by agreeing to this segregation and boxing, what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.320" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">carving off little bits of the world that are simple enough so that someone like you can live for some amount of time there without too much danger</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:35.680" style="s2">and everyone agrees to do that, roughly speaking, because everybody needs to engage in that</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.680" end="01:21:39.280" style="s2">process of simplification and safety provision</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.280" end="01:21:45.300" style="s2">and so, so we have towns, and those towns are nothing but boxes inside boxes</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.300" end="01:21:51.040" style="s2">so there&#39;s a good schematic of a little house</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.040" end="01:21:55.900" style="s2">and you can see that even inside the same place we segregate off rooms for different purposes</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.900" end="01:22:02.540" style="s2">and then, what&#39;s interesting, too, is that we set up those rooms as little dramatic spaces; right, so you furnish them</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.540" end="01:22:06.020" style="s2">and you furnish them with things that tell you how to behave in that room</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.020" end="01:22:11.100" style="s2">so table and chairs tells you that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to eat, and that&#39;s where people are going to sit, and</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.100" end="01:22:17.680" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna sit facing each other, and that has certain implications, &#39;cause the chairs don&#39;t face the walls, they face each other</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.680" end="01:22:20.680" style="s2">and you have a living room where it&#39;s comfortable, and there&#39;s a fire, and</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.680" end="01:22:23.880" style="s2">you know, you&#39;re setting up little stages, basically, so that...</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.880" end="01:22:28.180" style="s2">just like kids do when they pretend, you know, they all assign each other roles</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.180" end="01:22:32.040" style="s2">and then they lay out a little drama; and that&#39;s what you do when you invite someone over</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.040" end="01:22:36.000" style="s2">well, let&#39;s sit in the living room, well, you&#39;ll probably get a drink if you sit in the living room</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.000" end="01:22:38.780" style="s2">and hypothetically you&#39;re gonna have some conversation</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.780" end="01:22:42.140" style="s2">so it&#39;s a bounded place, there are rules that apply</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.140" end="01:22:46.720" style="s2">and then you get to have a little exploration inside that set of bounded rules, and</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.720" end="01:22:50.620" style="s2">if you&#39;re open, you&#39;re gonna discuss all sorts of things, and if you&#39;re conservative</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.620" end="01:22:55.300" style="s2">and closed, then you&#39;re gonna discuss a very, very small subset of things</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.300" end="01:22:58.940" style="s2">and so, hopefully everyone will agree on that</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.940" end="01:23:01.540" style="s2">so that&#39;s one form of binding</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.540" end="01:23:06.620" style="s2">then another is: we put boxes around each other when it comes to groups</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.620" end="01:23:12.280" style="s2">I think this is a picture from the Democratic convention</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.280" end="01:23:16.900" style="s2">when Obama was elected, if I remember correctly</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.900" end="01:23:23.540" style="s2">but anyways, what happens is that people segregate themselves into little microgroups, like Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.540" end="01:23:27.160" style="s2">and they basically do that on  temperamental grounds, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.160" end="01:23:34.000" style="s2">and then they produce these games that everyone knows how to play</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.000" end="01:23:37.340" style="s2">and that&#39;s another form of simplification</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.340" end="01:23:42.260" style="s2">so when you bring all these people together at a political convention</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.260" end="01:23:45.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they all have the same ideas, they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.140" end="01:23:49.980" style="s2">and it could degenerate into chaos, and sometimes that happens, you get big demonstrations at these places</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.000" end="01:23:52.480" style="s2">and sometimes people throw tear gas, and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.480" end="01:23:54.660" style="s2">but mostly speaking, it&#39;s pretty peaceful</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.660" end="01:24:01.400" style="s2">and the reason for that is that there&#39;s a set of procedures in place that have some historical justification</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.400" end="01:24:05.020" style="s2">that are embedded within a shared cultural and belief system</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.020" end="01:24:09.080" style="s2">and everybody goes there and agrees to play by the rules, roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.080" end="01:24:12.160" style="s2">and so then they can elect a candidate</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.160" end="01:24:15.580" style="s2">they can kind of flip it down to a binary choice for the election, right</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.580" end="01:24:18.120" style="s2">yes or no, something like that, and</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.120" end="01:24:21.680" style="s2">nobody gets killed, usually, so hooray for that</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.680" end="01:24:24.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of a thing to pull off, to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.020" end="01:24:29.340" style="s2">generate out of 300 million people two people to run for the highest office</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.340" end="01:24:32.880" style="s2">then let everyone play a game to determine who they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.880" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">and then to have the bloody thing function stably through power transitions</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:40.860" style="s2">that never happens, right, that&#39;s a complete bloody miracle</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.860" end="01:24:43.460" style="s2">and hardly any societies have ever pulled it off</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.460" end="01:24:46.160" style="s2">the power transition being the really important thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.160" end="01:24:52.360" style="s2">&#39;cause a tyrant can be stable for a while, but usually what happens is: he dies and all hell breaks loose</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.360" end="01:24:58.000" style="s2">I think it was George Washington that said or had said about him</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.000" end="01:25:03.740" style="s2">&#39;the reason that he was a great leader wasn&#39;t because he was president, but because he stopped being president&#39;</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.740" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">so then the next thing that sort of simplifies the world is actually your physiological structure</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:15.200" style="s2">we talked about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.200" end="01:25:20.140" style="s2">you can only see things that are in front of you, not things that are to the side or behind you</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.140" end="01:25:27.240" style="s2">you can only see a very narrow...</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.240" end="01:25:31.520" style="s2">you can only see a very narrow chunk of the electromagnetic spectrum</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.520" end="01:25:36.800" style="s2">roughly that chunk that enables you to see by sunlight and to detect ripe fruit and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.800" end="01:25:42.540" style="s2">so it&#39;s very evolutionarily determined, and...</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.540" end="01:25:47.360" style="s2">you see things of a certain size quite easily, because they&#39;re handy</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.360" end="01:25:53.500" style="s2">so objects manifest themselves to you as things-</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.500" end="01:25:59.840" style="s2">because they have some relationship to your capacity to use them as tools, and that&#39;s dependent on your size</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.840" end="01:26:02.680" style="s2">you have a certain strength and not a different strength</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.680" end="01:26:07.660" style="s2">you have a certain degree of articulation, there&#39;s some things you can represent in language, so</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.660" end="01:26:12.700" style="s2">you have limitations that screen out from your consideration all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.700" end="01:26:19.660" style="s2">and that&#39;s bad, because, for example, before people discovered germs, there was a lot of them zipping about, killing people</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.660" end="01:26:22.400" style="s2">and the fact that we couldn&#39;t see them wasn&#39;t such a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.400" end="01:26:24.560" style="s2">but by the same token</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.560" end="01:26:29.660" style="s2">we&#39;re also not as overwhelmed with complexity as we might be if we could detect everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.660" end="01:26:35.500" style="s2">and one of the problems with being connected so much is that it&#39;s easy to drown in information</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.500" end="01:26:41.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s rough for information foragers, you can&#39;t stay off your damn computer, because...</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.120" end="01:26:47.740" style="s2">it opens up your senses far beyond their normal limitations; and so where should you stop?</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.740" end="01:26:53.240" style="s2">well, you don&#39;t; you&#39;re on the damn thing like a pensioner on a slot machine</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.240" end="01:26:56.220" style="s2">and for many of the same reasons</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.220" end="01:27:03.040" style="s2">so your body also filters out the world for you and provides you acces to some information and not access to others</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.040" end="01:27:06.640" style="s2">and then the same thing is the case with your nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.640" end="01:27:15.980" style="s2">and I do... I put the first picture there of the central nervous system that controls voluntary movement, for example</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.980" end="01:27:20.700" style="s2">I put it there because people like to think that their brain is in their head</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.700" end="01:27:24.380" style="s2">but it&#39;s a stupid way of thinking about it, as far as I&#39;m concerned, because</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.380" end="01:27:28.400" style="s2">you have an awful lot of neurological tissue distributed through your body, and</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.400" end="01:27:32.360" style="s2">like your autonomic nervous system, if I remember correctly, which is mostly distributed through your body</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.360" end="01:27:35.500" style="s2">has more neurons in it than your central nervous system, and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.500" end="01:27:42.800" style="s2">you aren&#39;t a brain in a body, your brain is really distributed through your whole body</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.800" end="01:27:50.840" style="s2">and I think the idea that you have a brain in a body is kind of a holdover from the idea that you have a soul in a body</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.840" end="01:27:57.800" style="s2">not that I&#39;m necessarily criticizing that idea, but I think they kinda got graften onto one another, and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.800" end="01:28:01.700" style="s2">but the problem with that is that it...</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.700" end="01:28:09.820" style="s2">so it&#39;s the soul-body, brain-body, mind-body dichotomy, which I think is the same dichotomy</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.820" end="01:28:16.180" style="s2">and the problem with that is that it&#39;s easy to think of thought as something that&#39;s abstracted away from the body</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.180" end="01:28:20.040" style="s2">I think that was an enlightenment idea</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.040" end="01:28:27.860" style="s2">that just like the soul shouldn&#39;t be contaminated by the demands of the body, if you were going to be pure spiritually</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.860" end="01:28:32.680" style="s2">so your thought shouldn&#39;t be contaminated by your subjectivity, and your emotions</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.680" end="01:28:34.620" style="s2">and your motivations, and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.620" end="01:28:40.300" style="s2">it should... your abstractions should be independent of your subjectivity</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.300" end="01:28:47.960" style="s2">and rationality and emotion are construed in that manner as enemies</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.960" end="01:28:54.340" style="s2">the purpose of rationality is to dispense with the irrationality of emotion and motivation</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.340" end="01:28:59.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s... Freud&#39;s idea of the properly functioning ego is something like that, too</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.000" end="01:29:03.960" style="s2">because the Id is this place of compulsion and drive</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.960" end="01:29:09.060" style="s2">and the ego has to basically suppress that in the service of the superego</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.060" end="01:29:12.380" style="s2">there&#39;s no idea of integration, really, in Freud</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.380" end="01:29:14.840" style="s2">now, I don&#39;t wanna be rough on Freud</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.840" end="01:29:20.760" style="s2">and I think part of the reason that he thought that way is because the patients he had</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.760" end="01:29:26.500" style="s2">were precisely those who weren&#39;t very well integrated because of their pathological past</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.500" end="01:29:31.180" style="s2">and so they didn&#39;t know how to get those subsystems up into the overarching game</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.180" end="01:29:37.660" style="s2">and so their only alternative was something like suppression or repression</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.660" end="01:29:43.280" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t know how to be aggressive in a sophisticated way</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.280" end="01:29:49.100" style="s2">you&#39;re still gonna be aggressive, but you&#39;re gonna have to inhibit it, control yourself</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.100" end="01:29:53.740" style="s2">because you can&#39;t just be aggressive around people, it just won&#39;t go well for you</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.740" end="01:29:56.840" style="s2">so if you can&#39;t do it in a sophisticated way, you&#39;re gonna repress it</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.840" end="01:30:01.780" style="s2">or you&#39;re gonna get in trouble, those are the options, so...</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.780" end="01:30:06.920" style="s2">okay, but if you start thinking about the brain, the nervous system as part of the body</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.920" end="01:30:12.400" style="s2">as an inseparable part, well then the function of thinking seems to become something different</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.400" end="01:30:16.500" style="s2">it&#39;s not so much the objective, abstract representation of the world</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.500" end="01:30:23.180" style="s2">which is kinda what you&#39;re pursuing if you&#39;re a scientist, it&#39;s more like...</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.180" end="01:30:31.340" style="s2">it&#39;s more like conceptualization of and practice of the proper way of being in the world</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.340" end="01:30:37.640" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re more interested in anyways, I don&#39;t see how you can&#39;t be, since</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.640" end="01:30:46.860" style="s2">you&#39;re a living thing, and you&#39;re overwhelmingly motivated to</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.860" end="01:30:55.300" style="s2">successfully manifest those actions that a living thing has to manifest in order to continue</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.300" end="01:31:04.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s complicated, you can boil it down to survival and reproduction, it&#39;s a good overarching simplification</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.800" end="01:31:09.820" style="s2">but there&#39;s nothing simple about survival and reproduction, I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.820" end="01:31:15.460" style="s2">all sorts of complex monsters emerge even  out of that simple conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.460" end="01:31:22.660" style="s2">but it&#39;s not unreasonable to assume that one of the things that people generally want to do is to continue living in as pain-free manner as possible</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.660" end="01:31:26.160" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that, although that&#39;s a simplification</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.160" end="01:31:30.460" style="s2">so now the reason I&#39;m making that case is because</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.460" end="01:31:37.800" style="s2">the fact that you have a body and the fact that you have a nervous system is another set of limitations on</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.800" end="01:31:39.880" style="s2">how it is that you&#39;re going to interact with the world</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.880" end="01:31:45.340" style="s2">so now we&#39;ve got the nervous system, we can go to higher resolutions - you say you have a brain</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.340" end="01:31:50.900" style="s2">and the brain... that&#39;s the frontal cortex there</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.900" end="01:31:57.820" style="s2">and that&#39;s the temporal cortex there, and that&#39;s the parietal cortex there, and that&#39;s the sensory cortex there</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.820" end="01:32:04.660" style="s2">and these were, if I remember properly, these were divisions that I think were first</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.660" end="01:32:08.760" style="s2">thought through in the late XIX and early XX century</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.760" end="01:32:12.340" style="s2">they&#39;re slightly specialized</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.340" end="01:32:17.220" style="s2">so this cortex back here does a lot of the elaboration of vision</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.220" end="01:32:25.700" style="s2">and that one there helps you with your sense of embodiment and your knowledge about where your body actually happens to be localized</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.700" end="01:32:31.580" style="s2">and that one helps for example in some elements of language output, and</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.580" end="01:32:36.380" style="s2">then the frontal cortex, especially the prefrontal part, which is up here</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.380" end="01:32:42.900" style="s2">is concerned with the organization of motor action</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.900" end="01:32:45.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of thinking about it, you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.300" end="01:32:47.860" style="s2">part of your brain that deals with the sensory world</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.860" end="01:32:54.020" style="s2">and the integration of the sensory world, which seems to happen about there, where these places meet</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.020" end="01:32:59.560" style="s2">and the prefrontal cortex grew out of the motor cortex</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.560" end="01:33:05.040" style="s2">the motor cortex helps you plan out voluntary actions</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.040" end="01:33:08.740" style="s2">the prefrontal cortex grew out of that in the course of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.740" end="01:33:12.660" style="s2">so you might think, well, there&#39;s reflex actions</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.660" end="01:33:16.040" style="s2">and they happen when something happens to you, you resond</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.040" end="01:33:21.880" style="s2">and then that elaborates up into the motor system, and that enables you to act voluntarily in the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.880" end="01:33:28.160" style="s2">and then that elaborates up into the prefrontal motor system, which helps you plan how you might act in the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.160" end="01:33:34.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s the prefrontal cortex that&#39;s the home of, let&#39;s call it, complex, sophisticated, voluntary thought</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.880" end="01:33:38.080" style="s2">which you could think about as a way of representing the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.080" end="01:33:44.300" style="s2">but which is more accurately a way of generating avatars of yourself in hypothetical worlds</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.300" end="01:33:49.240" style="s2">to figure out how they would survive if you did implement them into action</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.240" end="01:33:51.880" style="s2">and so, I think that&#39;s why...</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.880" end="01:33:55.680" style="s2">one of the weird things that you discover psychometrically</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.680" end="01:34:00.120" style="s2">is that there&#39;s no correlation between conscientiousness and intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.120" end="01:34:06.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s a weird one, because people think about intelligence as planning and forward thinking and all of that</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.560" end="01:34:09.220" style="s2">but that&#39;s also how they think about conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.220" end="01:34:15.720" style="s2">as planful behavior and the consideration of future possibilities, but</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.720" end="01:34:19.700" style="s2">intelligence and conscientiousness have zero correlation</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.700" end="01:34:24.020" style="s2">so you think, well, why is that? I guess it has to be that way, because</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.020" end="01:34:28.060" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t think abstractly if you were prone to act out what you thought</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.060" end="01:34:30.860" style="s2">you&#39;d just go and act it out</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.860" end="01:34:34.640" style="s2">I mentioned this to you before, when you dream, you&#39;re paralyzed</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.640" end="01:34:39.820" style="s2">and you can take that little part of the brain that produces that paralysis out of a cat</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.820" end="01:34:42.340" style="s2">or out of a person, but we haven&#39;t done it with people</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.340" end="01:34:48.940" style="s2">out of a cat, and then when the cat falls asleep, it hits REM sleep, it&#39;ll run around until it runs into something, and then it&#39;ll wake up</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.940" end="01:34:54.540" style="s2">so the dream thinking is so tightly allied with action that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.540" end="01:34:58.020" style="s2">there&#39;s no separation between them, so there&#39;s no real abstraction there</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.020" end="01:35:02.000" style="s2">if you couldn&#39;t abstract, you wouldn&#39;t be able to think</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.000" end="01:35:06.240" style="s2">and the fact that you can abstract means that you can separate your thinking from your action</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.240" end="01:35:11.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s why, as far as I can tell, there&#39;s very little correlation between conscientiousness and intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.760" end="01:35:17.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like it has to be that way, because you have to be able to think about things that you wouldn&#39;t do, if you&#39;re going to think</p>
<p begin="01:35:17.780" end="01:35:25.240" style="s2">and generally we think of people who act as soon as they think as impulsive</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.240" end="01:35:29.660" style="s2">so...</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.660" end="01:35:33.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a huge part of the brain that&#39;s devoted to sensory processing</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.840" end="01:35:37.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s a huge part of the brain that&#39;s devoted to planning</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.080" end="01:35:40.180" style="s2">and the whole prefrontal part of the brain is devoted to planning</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.180" end="01:35:45.120" style="s2">and what that indicates is that in large part</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.120" end="01:35:48.940" style="s2">as far as your evolved body is concerned</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.940" end="01:35:52.680" style="s2">the reason that you think is so that you can act better</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.680" end="01:35:54.680" style="s2">and of course that makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.680" end="01:35:58.500" style="s2">and you can think about memory from that perspective, too, because</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.500" end="01:36:04.940" style="s2">if you think scientifically, you think that your memory of the world is something like an objective record of events, of objective events</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.940" end="01:36:08.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s really not very much like that at all</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.200" end="01:36:11.340" style="s2">and besides, who cares?</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.340" end="01:36:15.680" style="s2">you don&#39;t need an accurate representation of all the facts about this room</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.680" end="01:36:17.720" style="s2">in fact, all it would do is weigh you down</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.720" end="01:36:20.660" style="s2">who cares what color the walls are? or what color the ceiling is?</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.660" end="01:36:25.740" style="s2">or what color the paint is; all of that&#39;s not worth remembering</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.740" end="01:36:31.580" style="s2">partly &#39;cause it has no relationship whatsoever to what you need to do in order to continue to act</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.580" end="01:36:34.600" style="s2">and so what you&#39;re doing when you remember, as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.600" end="01:36:39.640" style="s2">is that you&#39;re mining your experience for information that you can bring forward into the future</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.640" end="01:36:43.080" style="s2">it&#39;s purely pragmatic, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.080" end="01:36:50.440" style="s2">I treat people who have post-traumatic disorder or symptoms of post-traumatic disorder</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.440" end="01:36:55.260" style="s2">and so, let&#39;s say they got post-traumatic stress disorder because</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.260" end="01:36:59.260" style="s2">again, because a relationship collapsed on them suddenly, which is quite common</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.260" end="01:37:05.040" style="s2">you know, they get betrayed or someone leaves them suddenly, and then they don&#39;t know what to do, because</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.040" end="01:37:10.840" style="s2">especially if they&#39;re conscientious, because then they just tear themselves to pieces trying to figure out what they did wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.840" end="01:37:12.840" style="s2">to bring about that event</p>
<p begin="01:37:12.840" end="01:37:17.720" style="s2">and the reason they&#39;re doing that is that they wanna retool their perceptions and their actions</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.720" end="01:37:22.140" style="s2">so that the probability that they&#39;ll have the same experience again is minimized</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.140" end="01:37:25.040" style="s2">and their mind won&#39;t leave them alone &#39;till they do it</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.040" end="01:37:30.560" style="s2">and no wonder, tight, because if you fall into a big pit and you get really hurt</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.560" end="01:37:35.340" style="s2">the first thing you should figure out is how to not fall into big pits anymore</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.340" end="01:37:38.740" style="s2">and your mind is set up exactly for that, and so...</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.740" end="01:37:41.260" style="s2">what you do with someone whose having problems like that</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.260" end="01:37:45.360" style="s2">so maybe they&#39;re waking up in the middle of the night, obsessing about what went wrong</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.360" end="01:37:47.640" style="s2">is you walk them through it</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.640" end="01:37:51.120" style="s2">you do a situational analysis first, because</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.120" end="01:37:56.820" style="s2">one of the oversimplifications that people make, and this is especially true for conscientious people, is:</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.820" end="01:38:01.820" style="s2">if something bad happened to me, I must have done something to deserve it</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.820" end="01:38:04.660" style="s2">now, that&#39;s actually a prestty functional idea, because</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.660" end="01:38:10.580" style="s2">it suggests that there are things about your behavior that you could change that would make the future better</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.580" end="01:38:18.860" style="s2">but the problem is that, say if it&#39;s the collapse of a relationship and you&#39;ve been with that person for eight years or longer</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.860" end="01:38:22.180" style="s2">well, you did so many things with them</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.180" end="01:38:27.420" style="s2">that the idea that you did something wrong pretty much extends to every single thing you ever did with them</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.420" end="01:38:30.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s... how are you gonna fix that?</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.520" end="01:38:34.720" style="s2">and so that&#39;s part of the trauma, actually; the trauma is</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.720" end="01:38:40.280" style="s2">80 million snakes, all at the same time; it&#39;s like, well, forget it</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.280" end="01:38:44.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t have time to go through all that material, and so</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.000" end="01:38:47.900" style="s2">partly what you do with people, and this is what you should do with yourself, too</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.900" end="01:38:50.420" style="s2">is you do a situational analysis</p>
<p begin="01:38:50.420" end="01:38:56.500" style="s2">don&#39;t be assuming necessarily that the thing that happened to you only happened to you because of what you did or didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.500" end="01:38:59.280" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of factors at play, so</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.280" end="01:39:03.480" style="s2">one of the things I sometimes do with clients is that if they were in a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.480" end="01:39:06.940" style="s2">and I can get some reasonable personality information about both of them</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.940" end="01:39:11.120" style="s2">I can point out where they were temperamentally incompatible</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.120" end="01:39:15.980" style="s2">you know, like if you&#39;re a highly conscientious person and your partner is very, very low in conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.980" end="01:39:20.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like: well good luck to you two! how in the hell are you ever gonna work that out?</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.440" end="01:39:24.920" style="s2">because you want everything to be exactly where it&#39;s supposed to be and you&#39;re working all the time</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.920" end="01:39:29.900" style="s2">and your partner could care less whether things were where they&#39;re supposed to be, and they&#39;re not gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.900" end="01:39:35.020" style="s2">and you can butt heads about that forever, but the probability that you&#39;re gonna shift it</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.020" end="01:39:38.640" style="s2">you know, except to some minor degree, is very, very low</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.640" end="01:39:47.480" style="s2">and so sometimes you end up with someone with whom you get along very well on one temperamental dimension and you&#39;re an absolute catastrophe on the other four</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.480" end="01:39:53.540" style="s2">and he probability that you&#39;re going to be able to mediate a huge temperamental difference is extremely low</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.540" end="01:39:58.020" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t expect yourself to mediate a huge intellectual difference</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.020" end="01:40:00.600" style="s2">right? you&#39;re gonna make the other person smarter?</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.600" end="01:40:06.340" style="s2">or maybe you smarter, depending on who you&#39;re with; it&#39;s like, no, probably not, a bit, maybe</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.340" end="01:40:10.080" style="s2">so you do a situational analysis</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.080" end="01:40:18.040" style="s2">and so what you&#39;re trying to do is to extract out information from your past and your present that will enable you to conduct yourself properly into the future</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.040" end="01:40:23.400" style="s2">and so that&#39;s another example of the pragmatic element of thought</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.400" end="01:40:30.940" style="s2">well then, within the brain itself, apart from the major subdivisions which we just described, there are</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.940" end="01:40:33.640" style="s2">minor subdivisions, and here&#39;s a bunch of them listed</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.640" end="01:40:38.580" style="s2">the caudate nucleus, the cerebral cortex, a huge, newest part of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:40:38.580" end="01:40:42.440" style="s2">that&#39;s about a square meter if you unfold it, it&#39;s all folded up</p>
<p begin="01:40:42.440" end="01:40:47.280" style="s2">and most of the processing occurs right on the surface, that&#39;s the idea, anyways</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.280" end="01:40:51.960" style="s2">the thalamus, that&#39;s a place where a lot of the information in the brain appears to be integrated</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.960" end="01:40:56.920" style="s2">the cerebellum helps you with balance and the sequencing of complex motor activities</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.920" end="01:40:59.500" style="s2">the hippocampus, that&#39;s the one we talked about before</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.500" end="01:41:06.440" style="s2">one of the things that the hippocampus does, seems to do, is compare your model of the world as it&#39;s unfolding with the model that</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.440" end="01:41:11.440" style="s2">that you desire to be ocurring, and then keeps track of mismatches</p>
<p begin="01:41:11.440" end="01:41:16.660" style="s2">and if it detects a mismatch, then it disinhibits other emotional and motivational centers</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.660" end="01:41:21.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s the beginning of your response to the unknown, so...</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.940" end="01:41:25.140" style="s2">one of them is the hypothalamus, I&#39;m gonna concentrate on it for a bit</p>
<p begin="01:41:25.140" end="01:41:31.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a little, tiny part of the brain that&#39;s  pretty much at the top of the spinal cord, see it&#39;s really small</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.700" end="01:41:33.700" style="s2">compared to the rest of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.700" end="01:41:37.280" style="s2">now, imagine this is a cat brain for a minute</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.280" end="01:41:42.040" style="s2">and you take off the whole cat brain except for the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.040" end="01:41:46.340" style="s2">which people do, you take off the whole cortex, for example</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.340" end="01:41:50.580" style="s2">and then the cat&#39;s still alive if you do it carefully</p>
<p begin="01:41:50.580" end="01:41:55.240" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have much of a brain, and so you might think, well that cat would just do nothing, but it...</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.240" end="01:41:59.400" style="s2">cat&#39;s actually pretty functional if it&#39;s reduced just to it&#39;s hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.400" end="01:42:03.260" style="s2">and that&#39;s because the hypothalamus is an incredibly important part of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.260" end="01:42:09.120" style="s2">and it provides what I would say constitute the major frames, the maojr psychological frames</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.120" end="01:42:15.360" style="s2">and so,  a decorticate cat can stil eat and drink</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.360" end="01:42:19.640" style="s2">and regulate its body temperature, and engage in defensive aggression</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.640" end="01:42:24.980" style="s2">and if it&#39;s female, it can still mate, male can&#39;t, &#39;cause the male mating behavior is more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.980" end="01:42:31.420" style="s2">and as long as you keep it in a bounded environment, it can function reasonably well</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.420" end="01:42:34.120" style="s2">it&#39;s hypercurious, though</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.120" end="01:42:38.060" style="s2">which is very weird, because you wouldn&#39;t expect a cat with no brain to be curious about anything</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.060" end="01:42:40.540" style="s2">but a cat with no brain is curious about everything</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.540" end="01:42:42.540" style="s2">and that seems to be because...</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.540" end="01:42:46.880" style="s2">part of the reason that you aren&#39;t curious about something anymore is &#39;cause you&#39;ve investigated it</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.880" end="01:42:50.300" style="s2">and you&#39;ve built a representation of it that&#39;s functional</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.300" end="01:42:54.260" style="s2">and that functional representation then stands for the thing itself</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.260" end="01:42:57.240" style="s2">and then you can ignore it, and so you learn to ignore things</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.240" end="01:43:00.320" style="s2">they&#39;re interesting to begin with, and then you learn to ignore them</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.320" end="01:43:04.300" style="s2">and so, one of the things that I think artists do, if they&#39;re great artists</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.300" end="01:43:10.360" style="s2">is remind you that there&#39;s more to things than you see now that you&#39;ve learned to ignore them</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.360" end="01:43:15.540" style="s2">so you get a kind of a halucinogenic painting of flower, like van Gogh might produce</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.540" end="01:43:20.880" style="s2">like his famous irises, which I think sold for like 220 milion dollars or something outrageous</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.880" end="01:43:26.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like what van Gogh is trying to show you is what those flowers looked like before you thought you could see them</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.440" end="01:43:30.680" style="s2">&#39;cause now: &quot;flower&quot;, and you walk by, you don&#39;t see it at all</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.680" end="01:43:33.560" style="s2">&#39;cause you&#39;re off to get a peanut butter sandwich or something</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.560" end="01:43:38.440" style="s2">you don&#39;t have time to glory in the wonder of the world, you&#39;ve got something practival to do</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.440" end="01:43:44.160" style="s2">alright, so we&#39;re gonna zoom in on the hypothalamus here</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.160" end="01:43:50.460" style="s2">and what you see, of course, when you zoom in on the hypothalamus, is that it&#39;s not a thing</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.460" end="01:43:52.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a whole bunch of things</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.220" end="01:43:59.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s one of those horrible whole bunches of things that are made out of even more bunches of things, and then they&#39;re made out of more bunches of things, and</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.640" end="01:44:04.300" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting about going down the body from an analytic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:44:04.300" end="01:44:08.140" style="s2">is that it doesn&#39;t seem to get less complex as you go farther down, you know</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.140" end="01:44:12.900" style="s2">some of the... I should actually show you that...</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.900" end="01:44:17.500" style="s2">I haven&#39;t shown you that little video of DNA fixing itself, eh?</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.500" end="01:44:24.760" style="s2">I better show you that, it&#39;s so cool, it&#39;s ridiculously cool, so you definitely need to see it</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.760" end="01:44:31.160" style="s2">&gt;&gt;untill I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell, I was a molecular biologist at the Scrips (?) Institute</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.160" end="01:44:34.680" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and these pictures are all... everything&#39;s accurate, it&#39;s all to scale</p>
<p begin="01:44:34.680" end="01:44:40.000" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.000" end="01:44:45.020" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so this is a trans-section through blood, in the top left hand corner you&#39;ve got this yellow-green area</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.020" end="01:44:49.720" style="s2">&gt;&gt;the yellow-green area is the fluids of blood, which is mostly water, but it&#39;s also antibodies, sugars</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.720" end="01:44:51.480" style="s2">&gt;&gt;hormones, that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.480" end="01:44:55.280" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and the red region is a slice into a red blood cell, and those red molecules are hemoglobin</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.280" end="01:44:57.900" style="s2">&gt;&gt;they are actually red, that&#39;s what gives blood its color</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.900" end="01:45:03.520" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and carry it to other parts in the body</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.520" end="01:45:06.500" style="s2">&gt;&gt;I was very much inspired by this image many years ago</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.500" end="01:45:11.860" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world, what would it look like?</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.860" end="01:45:15.780" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and that&#39;s how I really began, so let&#39;s begin</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.780" end="01:45:21.200" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this is DNA in its classic double helix for, and it&#39;s from x-ray crystallography, so it&#39;s an accurate model of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.200" end="01:45:26.500" style="s2">&gt;&gt;if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands, you see these things that look like teeth</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.500" end="01:45:30.660" style="s2">&gt;&gt;those are the letters of the genetic code, the 25 000 genes you&#39;ve got written in your DNA</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.660" end="01:45:34.360" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this is what they typically talk about, the genetic code, this is what they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.360" end="01:45:39.420" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but I wanna talk about a different aspect of DNA science, and that is the physical nature of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.420" end="01:45:44.840" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and it&#39;s these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can&#39;t go into right now</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.840" end="01:45:50.760" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but they physically run in opposite directions, which creates a number of complications for your living cells</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.760" end="01:45:54.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;as you&#39;re about to see; most particularly when DNA is being copied</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.380" end="01:46:00.500" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and so, what I&#39;m about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.500" end="01:46:04.660" style="s2">&gt;&gt;that&#39;s occurring right now inside your body, at least 2002 biology</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.660" end="01:46:08.060" style="s2">&gt;&gt;DNA is entering the production line from the left-hand side</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.060" end="01:46:11.500" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and it hits this collection, this miniature biochemical machines that are</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.500" end="01:46:14.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.380" end="01:46:20.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so DNA comes in and hits this blue doughnut-shaped structure, and it&#39;s ripped apart into its two strands</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.380" end="01:46:24.900" style="s2">&gt;&gt;one strand can be copied directly, and you can see these things spooling off down to the bottom there</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.900" end="01:46:28.820" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but things aren&#39;t so simple for the other strands, because it must be copied backwards</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.820" end="01:46:32.900" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so it&#39;s thrown out repeatedly in these loops, and copied one section at a time</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.900" end="01:46:35.580" style="s2">&gt;&gt;creating two new DNA molecules</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.580" end="01:46:43.660" style="s2">&gt;&gt;now you have billions of this machine right now working inside you, copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.660" end="01:46:48.660" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it&#39;s an accurate representation, and it&#39;s pretty much at the correct speed for at what is occurring inside you</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.660" end="01:46:52.940" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but I&#39;ve left out error correction and a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.940" end="01:46:57.960" style="s2">[applause] &gt;&gt;this was work from a number of years ago; thank you</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.960" end="01:47:03.260" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this is work from a number of years ago, but what I&#39;ll show you next is updated science, it&#39;s updated technology</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.260" end="01:47:09.840" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so again we begin with DNA, and it&#39;s jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding supermolecules, which are stripped away so you can see something</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.840" end="01:47:13.600" style="s2">&gt;&gt;DNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.600" end="01:47:19.620" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but in each one of your cells, each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.620" end="01:47:27.040" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code it&#39;s wrapped around these purple proteins, I&#39;ve labeled them purple here</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.040" end="01:47:31.700" style="s2">&gt;&gt;It&#39;s packaged up in bundles [?], all this field of view is a single strand of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.700" end="01:47:37.460" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this huge package od DNA is called a chromosome, and we&#39;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute</p>
<p begin="01:47:37.460" end="01:47:39.800" style="s2">&gt;&gt;we&#39;re pulling out, we&#39;re zooming out</p>
<p begin="01:47:39.800" end="01:47:43.980" style="s2">&gt;&gt;out through a nuclear pore, which is sort of the gateway to this compartment</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.980" end="01:47:46.800" style="s2">&gt;&gt;that holds all the DNA, called the nucleus</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.800" end="01:47:55.120" style="s2">&gt;&gt;all of this field of view is about a semester&#39;s worth of biology, and I&#39;ve got 7 minutes, so we&#39;re not gonna be able to do that today</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.120" end="01:47:57.560" style="s2">&gt;&gt;no, I&#39;m being told no</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.560" end="01:48:01.360" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this is the way a living cell looks down a live microscope</p>
<p begin="01:48:01.360" end="01:48:04.260" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and it&#39;s been filmed under time lapse, which is why you can see it moving</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.260" end="01:48:08.860" style="s2">&gt;&gt;the nuclear envelope breaks down; these sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes, and we&#39;ll focus on them</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.860" end="01:48:14.240" style="s2">&gt;&gt;they go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.240" end="01:48:18.720" style="s2">&gt;&gt;when the cell feels it&#39;s ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.720" end="01:48:22.760" style="s2">&gt;&gt;one set of DNA goes to one side, the other side gets the other set of DNA</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.760" end="01:48:26.360" style="s2">&gt;&gt;identical copies of DNA; and then the cell splits down the middle</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.360" end="01:48:31.420" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.420" end="01:48:34.500" style="s2">&gt;&gt;now we&#39;re gonna rewind and just focus on the chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.500" end="01:48:37.220" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and look at tis structure, and describe it</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.220" end="01:48:40.600" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so again, here we are at that equator moment</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.600" end="01:48:45.920" style="s2">&gt;&gt;the chromosomes line up, and if we isolate just one chromosome, we&#39;re gonna pull it out and have a look at its structure</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.920" end="01:48:53.040" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have, at least as we&#39;ve discovered so far inside of us</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.040" end="01:48:57.980" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so this is a single chromosome, and you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome</p>
<p begin="01:48:57.980" end="01:49:02.400" style="s2">&gt;&gt;one is bundled up into one sausage, the other strand  is bundled up into the other sausage</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.400" end="01:49:07.420" style="s2">&gt;&gt;these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.420" end="01:49:12.860" style="s2">&gt;&gt;they&#39;re called microtubules, but the name&#39;s not important; but we&#39;re gonna focus on this red region, I&#39;ve labaled it red here</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.860" end="01:49:17.360" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and it&#39;s the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.360" end="01:49:20.620" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it is obviously central fo the movement of the chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.620" end="01:49:24.180" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but we have no idea, really, as to how it&#39;s achieving that movement</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.180" end="01:49:28.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;we&#39;ve been studying this thing they call the kinetic core for over a hundred years with intense study</p>
<p begin="01:49:28.380" end="01:49:31.300" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and we&#39;re still just beginning to discover what it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.300" end="01:49:36.800" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it is made up of about two hundred different types of proteins, thousands of proteins in total</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.800" end="01:49:39.860" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it is a signal broadcasting system</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.940" end="01:49:44.860" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it broadcasts through chemical signals, telling the rest of the cell when it&#39;s ready</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.860" end="01:49:49.700" style="s2">&gt;&gt;when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.700" end="01:49:53.100" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.100" end="01:49:58.980" style="s2">&gt;&gt;(?) it&#39;s involved in the growing of the microtubules, and it&#39;s able to transiently couple onto them</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.980" end="01:50:05.100" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it&#39;s also a tension-sensing system, it&#39;s able to feel when the cell is ready,  when the chromosome is correctly positioned</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.100" end="01:50:09.300" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it&#39;s turning green here, because it feels that everything is just right</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.300" end="01:50:12.640" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and you&#39;ll see there&#39;s this one little last bit, that&#39;s still remaining red</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.640" end="01:50:16.720" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and it&#39;s walked away down the microtubules</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.720" end="01:50:23.000" style="s2">&gt;&gt;that is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal, and it&#39;s walked away, it&#39;s that mechanical</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.000" end="01:50:27.540" style="s2">&gt;&gt;it&#39;s molecular clockwork, this is how you work at the molecular scale</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.540" end="01:50:31.340" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so with a little bit of molecular eye candy...</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.340" end="01:50:36.320" style="s2">&gt;&gt;we&#39;ve got kinesines, which are tho orange ones, they&#39;re little molecular courier molecules walking one way</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.320" end="01:50:41.920" style="s2">&gt;&gt;and here are the dionine(?), they&#39;re carrying that red broadasting system, and they&#39;ve got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.920" end="01:50:48.460" style="s2">&gt;&gt;so again, this is all derived accurately from the science, the problem is we can&#39;t show it to you any other way</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.460" end="01:50:55.180" style="s2">&gt;&gt;exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding is mindblowing</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.180" end="01:51:01.080" style="s2">&gt;&gt;discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.080" end="01:51:04.020" style="s2">&gt;&gt;but most medical researchers...</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.020" end="01:51:08.240" style="s2">&gt;&gt;this is just... discovering this stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.240" end="01:51:17.380" style="s2">&gt;&gt;which are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty, thank you</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.380" end="01:51:19.440" style="s2">&gt;&gt;[applause]</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.440" end="01:51:25.420" style="s2">so like that&#39;s just so ridiculously mindblowing that it&#39;s amost unbearable</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.420" end="01:51:29.680" style="s2">to think about that as clockwork even is a pretty strange idea</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.680" end="01:51:35.900" style="s2">because those little things walk over obstacles, how the hell does that happen? they&#39;re just molecules</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.900" end="01:51:40.900" style="s2">so it&#39;s so cool, &#39;cause when you go down you think &quot;simple&quot;, but you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:40.900" end="01:51:48.080" style="s2">and he said at the beginning, when the little machines were taking the DNA apart that he didn&#39;t show the error correcting</p>
<p begin="01:51:48.080" end="01:51:55.140" style="s2">there are these other little machines that go along and see if everything&#39;s okay, and if it isn&#39;t, they cut it out and put the right piece in</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.140" end="01:52:00.280" style="s2">yeah, things we don&#39;t understand, there&#39;s no shortage of them, that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.280" end="01:52:02.280" style="s2">okay, so</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.280" end="01:52:08.800" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing in some sense is walking you though a psychophysiological representation of</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.800" end="01:52:12.600" style="s2">Piaget&#39;s developmental process, I would say</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.600" end="01:52:19.520" style="s2">I wanted to zero in on the hypothalamus, becaue it seems to me the thing that sets the most basic frames</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.520" end="01:52:24.720" style="s2">and so, we&#39;ll go ahead with that</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.720" end="01:52:28.780" style="s2">so you see that it&#39;s made up of all these little parts</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.780" end="01:52:35.920" style="s2">so it&#39;s called the hypothalamus more for convenience than because it&#39;s a homogeneous set of structures</p>
<p begin="01:52:35.920" end="01:52:38.100" style="s2">&#39;cause it&#39;s not a homogeous set of structures</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.100" end="01:52:42.960" style="s2">this is something to consider very carefully when you&#39;re thinking about the terminology that psychologists use</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.960" end="01:52:46.080" style="s2">or that you might use to describe your own behavior</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.080" end="01:52:51.820" style="s2">&#39;cause you know, you can roughly... there is a psychology of motivation and there&#39;s a psychology of emotion</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.820" end="01:52:55.760" style="s2">and you might think, well, emotion and motivation are categorically different entities</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.760" end="01:52:57.760" style="s2">but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.760" end="01:53:03.800" style="s2">in fact, there&#39;s no such thing as a uniform set of motivations, and there&#39;s no such thing as a uniform set of emotions</p>
<p begin="01:53:03.800" end="01:53:08.940" style="s2">and the distinction between a motivation and an emotion is unclear, to say the least</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.940" end="01:53:16.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s partly because the physiological substructures that subsume what we call motivations and what we call emotions</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.800" end="01:53:20.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a motivation center that&#39;s homogeneous</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.620" end="01:53:25.560" style="s2">the closest is the hypothalamus, but it&#39;s made of structures that are qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="01:53:25.560" end="01:53:32.400" style="s2">and then the emotions... &#39;cause I have to use that descriptive terminology, &#39;cause we have to communicate about it somehow</p>
<p begin="01:53:32.400" end="01:53:36.960" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of different structures in the brain that contribute to emotional expression</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.960" end="01:53:40.260" style="s2">they&#39;re not even in the same place</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.260" end="01:53:44.600" style="s2">much less composed of identical structure or function</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.600" end="01:53:49.400" style="s2">so you know, we have shorthands that we use to divide up the world, but they&#39;re...</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.400" end="01:53:53.680" style="s2">they&#39;re awkward and untenable as the level of resolution increases</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.680" end="01:53:58.640" style="s2">but anyways, I&#39;m still gonna go with motivation and emotion, becasue it&#39;s a useful simplification</p>
<p begin="01:53:58.640" end="01:54:03.980" style="s2">but you can see with the hypothalamus that there&#39;s all these complicated little subsystems in there</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.980" end="01:54:07.960" style="s2">and I showed you that video to show you just how complicated the subsystems are</p>
<p begin="01:54:07.960" end="01:54:11.120" style="s2">all the way down to the molecular level</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.120" end="01:54:15.040" style="s2">how those little machines manage what they do is completely beyond me</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.040" end="01:54:19.840" style="s2">they call it clockwork when those little things that walk can walk over obstacles</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.840" end="01:54:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s like: clockwork does one thing only</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.520" end="01:54:27.240" style="s2">click, click, click, click, that&#39;s all it does, no exceptions</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.240" end="01:54:33.540" style="s2">this thing walks over obstacles to get where it&#39;s going; who knows what&#39;s going on down there?</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.540" end="01:54:37.420" style="s2">but it works well enough, so here we are, weirdly enough</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.420" end="01:54:42.560" style="s2">so motivation seems to be to be the initial  framing process</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.560" end="01:54:47.660" style="s2">and you come in to the world with the motivational systems roughly ready to go</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.660" end="01:54:52.380" style="s2">babies are hungry, babies get cold, babies want something to drink</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.380" end="01:54:55.480" style="s2">so the world already comes...</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.480" end="01:55:00.940" style="s2">in some sense they come into the world with pre-packaged categories for existence</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.940" end="01:55:04.020" style="s2">and those are the categories that are going to aid their survival</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.020" end="01:55:07.100" style="s2">and you know, they&#39;re not simple, either; it&#39;s not so simple</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.100" end="01:55:11.740" style="s2">it&#39;s hunger, thirst, pleasure, pain, anxiety,</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.740" end="01:55:16.560" style="s2">and the classic emotions: sadness, joy, and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.560" end="01:55:20.340" style="s2">those systems are already there, but babies have more complicated systems, too</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.340" end="01:55:24.400" style="s2">like the system for exploration is already in place, and the system for play</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.400" end="01:55:27.360" style="s2">which is really complicated, it&#39;s already in place, so</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.360" end="01:55:31.120" style="s2">you come into the world with a human nature</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.120" end="01:55:36.800" style="s2">and the nature seems to be distributed across the subsystems, that&#39;s one way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.800" end="01:55:40.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s also useful to think about the operation of those subsystems as something like...</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.900" end="01:55:44.580" style="s2">you can think abouth them as games with an aim</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.580" end="01:55:51.140" style="s2">you could think about them as stories, you could think about them as frames of reference, you can think about them as action patterns</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.140" end="01:55:56.780" style="s2">all of those, and you can think abouth them as subpersonalities, which I actually think is maybe the best way to think about them</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.780" end="01:56:01.560" style="s2">because if you&#39;re hungry, it&#39;s not a deterministic drive</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.560" end="01:56:04.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a subpersonality that has a goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.360" end="01:56:08.620" style="s2">and then it has a bunch of action patterns that are going to work in reference to that goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.620" end="01:56:12.100" style="s2">it has a bunch of perceptions that suit that goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.100" end="01:56:15.700" style="s2">and it organizes your emotional responses around that goal</p>
<p begin="01:56:15.700" end="01:56:21.060" style="s2">and so, to think about it as a personality is a much more intelligent way to look at it</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.060" end="01:56:27.120" style="s2">one of the things about Skinner&#39;s rats... you know, Skinner could get rats to do almost anything, and he would reward them with food</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.120" end="01:56:33.140" style="s2">and so he had a simple rat model, but his rats were starved down to 75% of their normal body weight</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.140" end="01:56:38.200" style="s2">so not only were they not social, gregarious ratts, like rats are, &#39;cause they were isolated</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.200" end="01:56:42.120" style="s2">they were genetically altered from wild rats</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.120" end="01:56:46.400" style="s2">but they also weren&#39;t as complex as a real rat, because they were starvind, and so</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.400" end="01:56:49.740" style="s2">but you know, a starving rat is a prety good model of a rat</p>
<p begin="01:56:49.740" end="01:56:51.940" style="s2">and a rat is a pretty good model of a person</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.940" end="01:56:59.940" style="s2">but a lot of our models of simple behavior learning were based on starving, isolated rats, so anyways</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.940" end="01:57:04.340" style="s2">how to think about motivation? we&#39;ll think about it from the hypothalamic perspective</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.340" end="01:57:07.860" style="s2">so we could say one thing that motivation does is set goals</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.860" end="01:57:11.200" style="s2">we could say that emotions track progress towards goals</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.200" end="01:57:14.120" style="s2">and I&#39;m gonna use that schema, even though it&#39;s not exactly right</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.120" end="01:57:19.620" style="s2">so you say, well, motivation determines where you&#39;re gonna aim, so if you&#39;re hungry, you&#39;re gonna aim at something to eat</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.620" end="01:57:25.920" style="s2">and then that will organize your perceptions, so that you zero out everything that isn&#39;t relevant to that task</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.920" end="01:57:27.420" style="s2">which is almost everything</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.420" end="01:57:31.560" style="s2">you concentrate on those few things that are gonna facilitate your movement forward</p>
<p begin="01:57:31.560" end="01:57:34.680" style="s2">when you encounter those things, that produces positive emotion</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.680" end="01:57:41.520" style="s2">as you move throught the world towards your goal and you see that things are alying themselves out, that facilitate your movement forward</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.520" end="01:57:43.620" style="s2">those things cause positive emotion</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.620" end="01:57:47.640" style="s2">and if you encounter anything that gets in the way, then that produces negative emotion</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.640" end="01:57:52.240" style="s2">and it can be like threat, &#39;cause you&#39;re not supposed to encounter something that gets in the way</p>
<p begin="01:57:52.240" end="01:57:57.700" style="s2">it can be anger, so that you move it away, it can be frustration, disappointment, grief, those would...</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.700" end="01:58:04.660" style="s2">if you have a response that serious to an obstacle, it would probably punish the little motivated frame right out of existence</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.660" end="01:58:10.960" style="s2">so you walk downstairs and I don&#39;t know, the contracting company sent a wrecking ball through your kitchen</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.960" end="01:58:13.280" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be disappointing</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.280" end="01:58:16.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna keep eating your peanut butter sandwich in the rubble</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.080" end="01:58:18.980" style="s2">that little frame is going to get punished out of existence</p>
<p begin="01:58:18.980" end="01:58:21.680" style="s2">and some new goal is gonna pop up in its stead</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.680" end="01:58:25.940" style="s2">and one of the things we&#39;re gonna try to sort out is how do you decide</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.940" end="01:58:30.520" style="s2">when you&#39;ve encountered an obstacle that&#39;s so big that you should just quit and go do something else</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.520" end="01:58:33.480" style="s2">&#39;cause that&#39;s not obvious</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.480" end="01:58:37.680" style="s2">you can get into counterproductive persistence pretty easily</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.680" end="01:58:41.240" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how people solve that problem, it&#39;s a really complicated one</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.240" end="01:58:43.500" style="s2">so anyways, we&#39;re gonna work on that scenario</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.500" end="01:58:49.900" style="s2">your hypothalamus pops up micro-goals that are directly relevant to biological survival</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.900" end="01:58:52.140" style="s2">that produces a frame of reference</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.140" end="01:58:58.380" style="s2">so it&#39;s not a goal, and it&#39;s not a drive, and it&#39;s not a collection of behaviors, it&#39;s a little personality</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.380" end="01:59:02.400" style="s2">and the little personality has a viewpoint, it has thoughts that go along with it</p>
<p begin="01:59:02.400" end="01:59:06.260" style="s2">it has perceptions, it has action tendencies, all of that</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.260" end="01:59:10.100" style="s2">you can see this in addiction, most particularly</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.100" end="01:59:15.460" style="s2">so one of the things that you find often with people who are alcoholic is they lie all the time</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.460" end="01:59:21.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s because when they built a little alcohol-dependent personality inside of themselves</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.600" end="01:59:25.220" style="s2">or a big one, maybe it&#39;s 90% of their personality</p>
<p begin="01:59:25.220" end="01:59:29.240" style="s2">and one of the things that consists of</p>
<p begin="01:59:29.240" end="01:59:35.760" style="s2">is all the rationalizations that they&#39;ve used over the years to justify their addiction to themselves and to other people</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.760" end="01:59:39.120" style="s2">and so the addiction has a personality</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.120" end="01:59:41.020" style="s2">and so when the person is off...</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.020" end="01:59:46.440" style="s2">maybe they&#39;re addicted to meth or something like that, where we know the addiction is more...</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.440" end="01:59:50.520" style="s2">it&#39;s more short-term powerful than, I would say, an alcohol addiction</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.520" end="01:59:56.580" style="s2">they&#39;ll say anything, and the words are just tools to get towards the goal</p>
<p begin="01:59:56.580" end="02:00:01.960" style="s2">and if they happen to be deceptive, whatever, it doesn&#39;t matter, they&#39;re just practical tools to get towards the goal</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.960" end="02:00:05.980" style="s2">and then when you get towards a goal, you take a nice shot of meth or something like that</p>
<p begin="02:00:05.980" end="02:00:13.080" style="s2">you reinforce all those rationales that you used to get the drug, and the next time you&#39;re even a better deceiver and liar</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.080" end="02:00:19.320" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna say, motivations, one way of thinking about it is they set goals, but it&#39;s not the right way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.320" end="02:00:24.880" style="s2">they produce a whole framework of interpretation, and so we&#39;re gonna think about that framework of interpretation</p>
<p begin="02:00:24.880" end="02:00:27.860" style="s2">and then emotions emerge inside of that</p>
<p begin="02:00:27.860" end="02:00:33.240" style="s2">so the world is framed, motivation set goals, you could say the world has to be framed</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.240" end="02:00:37.640" style="s2">so motivation sets that frame: goals, emotions, perceptions and actions</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.640" end="02:00:39.900" style="s2">and then the actions (he means emotions) track progress, so</p>
<p begin="02:00:39.900" end="02:00:44.540" style="s2">positive emotion says: you&#39;re moving forward properly towards your goal</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.540" end="02:00:48.440" style="s2">and if you encounter something you don&#39;t expect, you stop, that&#39;s anxiety</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.440" end="02:00:50.780" style="s2">it&#39;s like: oh! we&#39;re not where we thought we were</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.780" end="02:00:56.880" style="s2">and so we don&#39;t know what to do, so we should stop, &#39;cause we don&#39;t know where we are and what we&#39;re doing; stop, frozen</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.880" end="02:01:03.720" style="s2">and then the more powerful negative emotions like pain, they might make you get out of theres, so...</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.720" end="02:01:09.820" style="s2">emotions: forward, stop, reverse; that&#39;s your emotions within that motivated frame</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.820" end="02:01:14.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s another example of how your mind is embedded in your body</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.500" end="02:01:20.340" style="s2">emotions are offshoots of action tendencies, that&#39;s the right way to think about it</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.340" end="02:01:23.980" style="s2">&#39;cause action is everything, fundamentally</p>
<p begin="02:01:23.980" end="02:01:26.180" style="s2">so what are some basic motivations?</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.180" end="02:01:31.820" style="s2">most of these are regulated by the hypothalamus, by the way, and that tells you just how important a control system it is</p>
<p begin="02:01:31.820" end="02:01:37.460" style="s2">the other that&#39;s useful to know about the hypothalamus is that it has projections going up from it that are like tree trunks</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.460" end="02:01:42.660" style="s2">and inhibitory projections coming down that are like grape vines</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.660" end="02:01:46.760" style="s2">so you can kinda control your hypothalamus as long as it&#39;s not on too much, but</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.760" end="02:01:51.560" style="s2">if it&#39;s on in any serious way, its like... it wins</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.560" end="02:01:57.220" style="s2">so partly what you do to stop yourself from falling under the dominion of your hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.220" end="02:02:01.380" style="s2">is to never, ever be anywhere where its action is necessary</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.380" end="02:02:04.040" style="s2">right? you don&#39;t wanna go into a biker bar</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.040" end="02:02:10.200" style="s2">because you might find yourself in a situation where panicked defensive aggression is immediately necessary</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.200" end="02:02:14.240" style="s2">you probably don&#39;t want that; you don&#39;t want the panic, you don&#39;t want the terror</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.240" end="02:02:19.420" style="s2">you don&#39;t want the frenzied fight, you don&#39;t want any of that, you don&#39;t wanna have to run away in absolute panic</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.420" end="02:02:21.300" style="s2">so you just don&#39;t go there</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.300" end="02:02:25.760" style="s2">and a huge part of how we regulate our emotions</p>
<p begin="02:02:25.760" end="02:02:29.300" style="s2">is just by never going anywhere where we have to experience them</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.300" end="02:02:35.940" style="s2">and so that has very little to do with internal inhibitory control, and everything to do with staying where you belong</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.940" end="02:02:38.800" style="s2">so... okay</p>
<p begin="02:02:38.800" end="02:02:41.920" style="s2">so, basic motivations: hunger, thirst, pain</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.920" end="02:02:45.020" style="s2">pain is not regulated by the hypothalamus, that&#39;s a different circuit</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.020" end="02:02:48.200" style="s2">anger / aggression, thermoregulation</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.200" end="02:02:50.100" style="s2">panic and escape</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.100" end="02:02:53.900" style="s2">affiliation and care, sexual desire, exploration, play</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.900" end="02:02:58.860" style="s2">and you can kinda break those into</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.860" end="02:03:04.720" style="s2">the classic darwinian categories, too, and say, well, there&#39;s a set of motivations that go along with self-maintenance</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.720" end="02:03:08.040" style="s2">that&#39;s be your survival, ingestive and defensive</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.040" end="02:03:11.700" style="s2">see, I&#39;ve sort of coded them there</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.700" end="02:03:15.480" style="s2">so the self maintenance</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.480" end="02:03:20.620" style="s2">there&#39;s an ingestive set of basic motivations that go with self maintenance, that&#39;s hunger, thirst</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.620" end="02:03:26.420" style="s2">there&#39;s a set of defensive motivations: pain, anger, thermoregulation, panic and escape</p>
<p begin="02:03:26.420" end="02:03:30.180" style="s2">and then there&#39;s motivations that are associated with reproduction</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.180" end="02:03:33.560" style="s2">affiliation, care, and sexual desire</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.560" end="02:03:37.920" style="s2">and then I put exploration and play sort of outside of that</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.920" end="02:03:43.400" style="s2">I would say because those two things serve both of these approximately equally</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.400" end="02:03:49.300" style="s2">so what I tried to do is take the basic motivations, and then nest them inside a fundamental darwinian framework</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.300" end="02:04:00.980" style="s2">so that you can see how the biological process of evolution has manifested itself, an then sort of differentiated into these fundamental biological systems</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.980" end="02:04:04.940" style="s2">okay, so this is a rat brain flat map</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.940" end="02:04:12.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically what you would see of a rat&#39;s brain if you flattened it out, unrolled it, flattened it out, and then made it two-dimesional</p>
<p begin="02:04:12.160" end="02:04:14.160" style="s2">and you can see here...</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.160" end="02:04:18.060" style="s2">so this is the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.100" end="02:04:22.180" style="s2">and you can see that it&#39;s made out of these different nuclei, that&#39;s what they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.180" end="02:04:26.140" style="s2">and they sort of correspond to those shapes that I showed you in the human hypothalamus earlier</p>
<p begin="02:04:26.140" end="02:04:31.620" style="s2">and you see that there&#39;s different systems, there&#39;s the system for eating and drinking, it&#39;s outlined in green</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.620" end="02:04:39.580" style="s2">and the reproductive system, there&#39;s two of them, and they&#39;re outlined in I think it&#39;s red... is that right?</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.580" end="02:04:44.880" style="s2">yeah, reproductive is red, and the defensive ones are in magenta</p>
<p begin="02:04:44.880" end="02:04:49.660" style="s2">and so those are the... you could think about those as the three fundamental value systems</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.660" end="02:04:54.860" style="s2">of living creatures with complex nervous systems as far as the hypothalamus is concerned</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.860" end="02:04:59.660" style="s2">and then, given what I told you about the hypothalamus, which is...</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.660" end="02:05:04.460" style="s2">you hardly need the rest of your brain at all, as long as you have a hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.460" end="02:05:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s worth thinking that those are very fundamental to value per se</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.720" end="02:05:14.920" style="s2">now, you might think, if you only need the damn hypothalamus, why bother with the rest of the brain at all?</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.920" end="02:05:17.380" style="s2">which is a very useful question</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.380" end="02:05:21.060" style="s2">especially because most creatures don&#39;t have much of a brain, so...</p>
<p begin="02:05:21.060" end="02:05:23.700" style="s2">but it seems to be something like:</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.700" end="02:05:28.400" style="s2">well, you&#39;ve got your eating and drinking system, your reproductive system, and your defensive system, but</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.400" end="02:05:32.880" style="s2">the problem is that those things, first of all, can conflict,</p>
<p begin="02:05:32.880" end="02:05:36.540" style="s2">you know, are you too hungry to sleep or too sleepy to eat?</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.540" end="02:05:39.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty simple kind of contradiction</p>
<p begin="02:05:39.400" end="02:05:43.340" style="s2">are you more angry at your partner or do you want sexual relations more?</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.340" end="02:05:46.820" style="s2">so they can conflict in the present</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.820" end="02:05:50.480" style="s2">but then they can conflict with other people doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.480" end="02:05:52.800" style="s2">and they can conflict across time</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.800" end="02:06:00.200" style="s2">and so partly the reason that you need the rest of your brain is to solve the problems from the solutions that the hypothalamus offers</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.200" end="02:06:06.340" style="s2">and so, because you don&#39;t wanna just eat and drink, and reproduce and defend yourself</p>
<p begin="02:06:06.340" end="02:06:11.440" style="s2">you wanna eat now, later, tomorrow, next week, and next month</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.440" end="02:06:16.220" style="s2">while you&#39;re able to engage in reproductive activity and defend yourself</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.220" end="02:06:20.840" style="s2">in multiple contexts, with a whole bunch of people, for as long as you can possibly manage it</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.840" end="02:06:23.520" style="s2">and so you need the rest of your brain to calculate that</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.520" end="02:06:29.560" style="s2">and so what the rest of your brain has to do, roughly speaking, is regulate these</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.560" end="02:06:35.140" style="s2">and also elaborate them up into... into something that&#39;s integrated inside you</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.140" end="02:06:37.660" style="s2">which might roughly be your personality, and then</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.660" end="02:06:41.440" style="s2">so that that personality is integrated with the personality of other people</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.440" end="02:06:43.800" style="s2">and so you can think about it as an emergent process</p>
<p begin="02:06:43.800" end="02:06:46.220" style="s2">this is one of the things I really like about Piaget</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.220" end="02:06:51.320" style="s2">he&#39;s so damn smart, because Piaget is the only thinker I know, really</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.320" end="02:06:55.480" style="s2">who really addressed the problem of the evolution of value systems</p>
<p begin="02:06:55.480" end="02:07:01.480" style="s2">like, he never nailed it down to the physiology, because there wasn&#39;t enough known about physiology when he did his work</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.480" end="02:07:03.920" style="s2">but it maps really nicely onto the physiology</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.920" end="02:07:06.100" style="s2">...</p>
<p begin="02:07:06.100" end="02:07:13.360" style="s2">but he got it right anyways, he said: you come into the world with a handful of preestablished reflexes</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.360" end="02:07:19.400" style="s2">okay, we&#39;re gonna complicate that up a bit: no, you come into the world with a handful of micropersonalities</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.400" end="02:07:24.100" style="s2">that are centered around these fundamental motivational axes, okay</p>
<p begin="02:07:24.100" end="02:07:26.840" style="s2">and then that gets you started</p>
<p begin="02:07:26.840" end="02:07:31.400" style="s2">and that has motor output as well as perceptions, and all of that, that&#39;s associated with it</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.400" end="02:07:35.660" style="s2">and then, as you interact initially, let&#39;s say, with your mother</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.660" end="02:07:39.340" style="s2">you start to learn how to integrate those things in some sort of social context</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.340" end="02:07:43.200" style="s2">because you form a relationship with your mother right off the bat</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.200" end="02:07:52.280" style="s2">and so, you&#39;re starting to figure out how to produce patterned and stable interactions between those motivational systems</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.280" end="02:07:55.040" style="s2">on a day to day, week to week, month to month basis</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.040" end="02:07:58.940" style="s2">and one of the things you do with kids, it&#39;s really important to do this with kids</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.940" end="02:08:02.200" style="s2">you wanna get them on to some sort of a routine</p>
<p begin="02:08:02.200" end="02:08:06.960" style="s2">&#39;cause what the routine is actually, is the beginnings of the system that integrates</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.960" end="02:08:10.460" style="s2">all of these underlying biological systems into some sort of unity</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.460" end="02:08:16.640" style="s2">&#39;cause they have to sleep and wake up, so you wanna get that nailed down, so it&#39;s predictable</p>
<p begin="02:08:16.640" end="02:08:19.080" style="s2">you know, they have to eat, they have to stay warm</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.080" end="02:08:23.240" style="s2">and they need to do that in a manner that&#39;s stable</p>
<p begin="02:08:23.240" end="02:08:32.020" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s to your great benefit as a parent that you get islands of stability planted in the life of your kid</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.020" end="02:08:39.900" style="s2">so that some of this gets simplified, so that the kid isn&#39;t constantly preoccupied with domination by these different motivational systems</p>
<p begin="02:08:39.900" end="02:08:46.280" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a useful thing to know, because you might think, well, you don&#39;t wanna impose any structure on your baby, it&#39;s like, no, wrong</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.280" end="02:08:49.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t wanna be a tyrant about it, but</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.600" end="02:08:55.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no difference between that structure, and the emergence of the child&#39;s adaptation to the world</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.160" end="02:09:02.260" style="s2">and to some degree what you&#39;re trying to do is free them up from arbitrary domination by these underlying motivational systems</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.260" end="02:09:08.740" style="s2">you know, &#39;cause if the baby gets too tired, it&#39;s a horrible little thing, it&#39;ll just scream at you non stop</p>
<p begin="02:09:08.740" end="02:09:13.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s not happy about it, it&#39;s like it&#39;s not good for anyone for that to happen</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.060" end="02:09:16.760" style="s2">and so the faster... you have to do it in relationship with the child</p>
<p begin="02:09:16.760" end="02:09:20.800" style="s2">some will sleep right away in a schedule almost immediately</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.800" end="02:09:26.860" style="s2">and other kids are harder to get their circadian rhythms regulated</p>
<p begin="02:09:26.860" end="02:09:30.700" style="s2">so you have to attend to the individual differences that characterize the child, but</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.700" end="02:09:41.320" style="s2">you&#39;re still trying to establish some stable harmony out of this mish-mash of initial systems</p>
<p begin="02:09:41.320" end="02:09:48.840" style="s2">alright, so that&#39;s sort of a physiological look, and this is a more of a conceptual look at it</p>
<p begin="02:09:48.840" end="02:09:52.860" style="s2">I said that each of these systems you can think about in a bunch of different ways</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.860" end="02:09:56.480" style="s2">you can think about it as something that sets a goal</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.480" end="02:10:01.120" style="s2">&quot;I&#39;m hungry, and I don&#39;t wanna be hungry - point A, point B</p>
<p begin="02:10:01.120" end="02:10:07.400" style="s2">so the hunger and the vision of the satiation of the hunger are all part of the same frame</p>
<p begin="02:10:07.400" end="02:10:10.920" style="s2">and so, if you&#39;re hungry, you go into the kitchen</p>
<p begin="02:10:10.920" end="02:10:17.720" style="s2">you know that already, that&#39;s part of your procedural knowledge about how the world works</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.720" end="02:10:23.320" style="s2">and then what you&#39;re gonna look for are only those things that are relevant to what you&#39;re trying to do in the kitchen</p>
<p begin="02:10:23.320" end="02:10:27.040" style="s2">everything else is zeroed out, you won&#39;t even really see it, and why would you?</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.040" end="02:10:31.000" style="s2">you want to see the things that are relevant to the task at hand</p>
<p begin="02:10:31.000" end="02:10:34.720" style="s2">and so that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s so cool, I think</p>
<p begin="02:10:34.720" end="02:10:38.920" style="s2">because what it means is that you see the things that are relevant to the task at hand</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.920" end="02:10:40.920" style="s2">and so, here&#39;s something to think about</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.920" end="02:10:44.780" style="s2">let&#39;s say that you see a whole bunch of things that you don&#39;t wanna see</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.780" end="02:10:47.600" style="s2">that make you constantly miserable and unhappy</p>
<p begin="02:10:47.600" end="02:10:53.000" style="s2">one thing that you might ask yourself is: are you sure that your goals are proper?</p>
<p begin="02:10:53.000" end="02:10:57.400" style="s2">because your goals determine what you see; now, not a 100 percent, obviously</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.400" end="02:11:03.560" style="s2">you could be thinking about the homework you&#39;re gonna do and step off a curb and be hit by a van, it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.560" end="02:11:09.140" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get hit by the van regardless of how you&#39;ve oriented your perceptions, in all likelihood</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.140" end="02:11:11.980" style="s2">so I&#39;m not trying to argue for pure solipsism</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.980" end="02:11:18.280" style="s2">but it is very interesting to consider that since you see in relationship to what you want</p>
<p begin="02:11:18.280" end="02:11:22.820" style="s2">that a very large amount of what you see is dependent on what you&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.820" end="02:11:26.480" style="s2">and so one issue is: if your life is wretched and miserable</p>
<p begin="02:11:26.480" end="02:11:30.580" style="s2">one thing to think about is whether or not what you&#39;re aiming at is the right thing to be aiming at</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.580" end="02:11:34.560" style="s2">and &quot;nothing&quot; is exactly the wrong answer to that</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.560" end="02:11:40.540" style="s2">&quot;I&#39;m aiming at nothing&quot; Okay, you&#39;re gonna experience a tremendous amount of misery and not very much joy</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.540" end="02:11:43.500" style="s2">so anyways, you&#39;ve got this little frame:</p>
<p begin="02:11:43.500" end="02:11:48.700" style="s2">you&#39;re somewhere, and it&#39;s not good enough, and you&#39;re going somewhere else, that&#39;s going to be better</p>
<p begin="02:11:48.700" end="02:11:55.660" style="s2">and what &quot;better&quot; depends upon is the state of these underlying biological systems</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.660" end="02:12:01.820" style="s2">and then, more complexly, as those biological systems get integrated into a personality, and into the social world</p>
<p begin="02:12:01.820" end="02:12:08.580" style="s2">then the frame and the goal is going to be dependent on that more complex hierarchical organization</p>
<p begin="02:12:08.580" end="02:12:10.900" style="s2">so, you&#39;re not in here &#39;cause you&#39;re hungry</p>
<p begin="02:12:10.900" end="02:12:15.060" style="s2">you&#39;re in here, because if you get a degree, maybe you don&#39;t ever have to be hungry</p>
<p begin="02:12:15.060" end="02:12:20.280" style="s2">so the hunger is properly incorporated into your...</p>
<p begin="02:12:20.280" end="02:12:23.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t wanna be cold, you don&#39;t wanna freeze to death in the winter, you don&#39;t wanna be on the street</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.660" end="02:12:26.540" style="s2">you know, so your higher-order goals are</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.540" end="02:12:30.820" style="s2">long-term socially negotiated solutions</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.820" end="02:12:37.680" style="s2">to the problems that are implicit in your being, that might be one way of thinkig about it</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.680" end="02:12:44.480" style="s2">and the microelements of this... so you could say &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot;, that&#39;s a physiological state and a conception</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.480" end="02:12:47.140" style="s2">&quot;I have a vision about how I&#39;m going to solve that&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.140" end="02:12:51.000" style="s2">but then... and that&#39;s an abstraction</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.000" end="02:12:56.900" style="s2">but what you do to transform point A into point B is not an abstraction, you act</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.900" end="02:13:02.820" style="s2">you know, so if you&#39;re hungry, you actually move your body, say down from the second floor into the kitchen</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.820" end="02:13:07.340" style="s2">and you arrange things so that there&#39;s transformations in the world</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.340" end="02:13:11.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a good way of thinking about the relationship between the mind and the body</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.100" end="02:13:15.620" style="s2">your hypothetical solution to your problem, that&#39;s the mind</p>
<p begin="02:13:15.620" end="02:13:18.780" style="s2">but the manner in which you incarnate that solution</p>
<p begin="02:13:18.780" end="02:13:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s no longer abstract</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.200" end="02:13:24.420" style="s2">you know, people are always trying to solve the mind-body problem</p>
<p begin="02:13:24.420" end="02:13:31.220" style="s2">and as far as I can tell, that&#39;s how you solve it, is: you have abstractions, but they&#39;re not abstractions that are representations of the world</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.220" end="02:13:36.180" style="s2">they&#39;re abstractions that are representations of action patterns</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.180" end="02:13:40.540" style="s2">and the way those are implemented in the world is that you act them</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.540" end="02:13:44.340" style="s2">and so, it&#39;s strange, &#39;cause you&#39;ve got this weird level of control</p>
<p begin="02:13:44.340" end="02:13:47.500" style="s2">I can move my arm, and I seem to be able to do that voluntarily</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.500" end="02:13:49.840" style="s2">but Ireally have no idea how I&#39;m doing it</p>
<p begin="02:13:49.840" end="02:13:55.980" style="s2">like I don&#39;t have conscious access exactly to the musculature, except technically</p>
<p begin="02:13:55.980" end="02:14:01.280" style="s2">and I certainly have no idea what I&#39;m doing chemically to make those muscles transform</p>
<p begin="02:14:01.280" end="02:14:07.540" style="s2">so my abstractions ground out in this movement</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.540" end="02:14:12.800" style="s2">and I can observe the movement, and modify it, but</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.800" end="02:14:17.480" style="s2">I have no conscious access whatsoever to the micro processes that are making tha possible</p>
<p begin="02:14:17.480" end="02:14:21.200" style="s2">I&#39;ve no idea why that is, probably because I&#39;m not smart enough</p>
<p begin="02:14:21.200" end="02:14:23.200" style="s2">that would be my guess</p>
<p begin="02:14:23.200" end="02:14:29.820" style="s2">evolution is only going to allow your mind to control those elements of your being</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.820" end="02:14:31.560" style="s2">that you&#39;re smart enough to control</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.560" end="02:14:35.500" style="s2">and so you don&#39;t get voluntary control over your heartbeat, for example, because you&#39;d just forget</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.500" end="02:14:42.540" style="s2">and then you&#39;d be wandering around, and then you&#39;d forget to beat your heart, bang, you&#39;d be dead, so you don&#39;t get to do that</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.540" end="02:14:46.260" style="s2">...</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.260" end="02:14:48.040" style="s2">all these different...</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.040" end="02:14:54.020" style="s2">I classify these, again, as self-propagation  and self-maintenance motivations</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.020" end="02:14:58.580" style="s2">if you&#39;re too hot, well, you wanna go somewhere cooler, and if you&#39;re too cool you wanna go somewhere hotter</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.580" end="02:15:00.580" style="s2">same if you&#39;re thirsty and hungry</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.580" end="02:15:05.880" style="s2">and for self-propagation, well, you get lonesome and maybe you have some sexual desire</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.880" end="02:15:11.280" style="s2">and each of those different systems competes for access to this central frame</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.280" end="02:15:15.420" style="s2">and that&#39;s something like the contents of your consciousness at any given time</p>
<p begin="02:15:15.420" end="02:15:20.920" style="s2">so up pops a desire... but it&#39;s a wrong way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.920" end="02:15:23.780" style="s2">&#39;cause a desire sounds like something that&#39;s pushing you forward</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.780" end="02:15:29.380" style="s2">but the desire is goal, framework, emotion, perception, action pattern, all at the same time</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.380" end="02:15:32.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a little personality, or it&#39;s a little story</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.160" end="02:15:37.560" style="s2">actually, when you describe the operation of one of these things, that&#39;s when you&#39;re teling a story</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.560" end="02:15:42.160" style="s2">so I was somewhere, I needed something, I went and got it</p>
<p begin="02:15:42.160" end="02:15:46.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a boring little story, but that&#39;s the basic unit of a story</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.900" end="02:15:50.560" style="s2">&#39;cause I don&#39;t care to hear what you&#39;re doing unless you had a reason for doing it</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.560" end="02:15:53.800" style="s2">I just say: what&#39;s the point of the story?</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.800" end="02:15:56.480" style="s2">and the point of the story is the point</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.480" end="02:15:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s directional, right?</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.480" end="02:16:03.220" style="s2">it says: &quot;I went from here to there&quot;, that&#39;s the point, &quot;here&#39;s how I did it&quot;, that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.220" end="02:16:06.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re interested in that, because maybe you want to know how to do it too</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.200" end="02:16:09.360" style="s2">and you won&#39;t have to struggle through it like I did, you could just listen</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.360" end="02:16:13.440" style="s2">and so we&#39;re always throwing these little units of information back and forth to each other</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.440" end="02:16:17.280" style="s2">and for good reason; I wanna know what your point is</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.280" end="02:16:22.220" style="s2">because better Iearn it from you than make all the mistakes that you had to make when you were learning it</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.220" end="02:16:27.400" style="s2">and human beings, we&#39;ve got that figured out, that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.400" end="02:16:31.900" style="s2">okay, I&#39;m gonna just explain this</p>
<p begin="02:16:31.900" end="02:16:35.460" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll stop; alright, so</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.500" end="02:16:40.600" style="s2">we&#39;re in one of those frames now, and we&#39;re going from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.600" end="02:16:44.040" style="s2">and so, the question is: how does the world lay itself out?</p>
<p begin="02:16:44.040" end="02:16:49.520" style="s2">okay, so the first thing to understand, and this is partly the reason I showed you the gorilla video, is that</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.520" end="02:16:53.160" style="s2">the first thing a frame does for you is make almost everything irrelevant</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.160" end="02:16:55.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s so great, because that&#39;s what you want</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.440" end="02:17:01.380" style="s2">you want almost everything to be irrelevant, because otherwise you&#39;re gonna be so flooded with information, that you...</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.380" end="02:17:05.620" style="s2">that&#39;s what hallucinogens do, at least in their initial stages</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.620" end="02:17:09.300" style="s2">is they take away that filter, and make everything relevant</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.300" end="02:17:13.520" style="s2">you can read about that in Huxley&#39;s &quot;Doors of Perception&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:17:13.520" end="02:17:17.420" style="s2">he does a great job of describing the initial stages of a mescaline experience</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.420" end="02:17:23.960" style="s2">and what happens is that all of the memory, in some sense, that regulates his perceptions is stripped off</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.960" end="02:17:29.740" style="s2">and so he sees everything glowing, and alive, and magical like he&#39;d never encountered it before</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.740" end="02:17:33.620" style="s2">which is exactly how you would see something if all your memory about it was  gone</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.620" end="02:17:38.000" style="s2">and so he sees things as way more complex and interesting than he normally sees them</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.000" end="02:17:43.360" style="s2">well, that&#39;s fine, but, you know, if you&#39;re like that all the time, then, you know, you end up in a ditch, starving to death or something</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.360" end="02:17:47.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not commensurate with normal life, that&#39;s what it looks like</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.420" end="02:17:54.780" style="s2">and so your perceptions are just shrunken, restricted to the bare minimum necessary to keep you moving in the direction that you&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.780" end="02:17:59.100" style="s2">alright, so the first thing you wanna do is you wanna make things irrelevant</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.100" end="02:18:02.360" style="s2">now, if you&#39;re with someone</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.360" end="02:18:04.540" style="s2">in a relationship</p>
<p begin="02:18:04.540" end="02:18:11.560" style="s2">partly what you want them to do is to help you continue making most of their possibility irrelevant</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.560" end="02:18:13.560" style="s2">it&#39;s polite</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.560" end="02:18:18.580" style="s2">so you say, well, &quot;we have a friendship&quot;, let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.580" end="02:18:23.380" style="s2">so that means you&#39;ve agreed to act in a friendly manner towards me, and to support me</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.380" end="02:18:25.620" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of other ways you could act</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.620" end="02:18:27.360" style="s2">like a myriad of them</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.360" end="02:18:32.100" style="s2">and I&#39; gonna do the same for you, so we&#39;re simpler to each other than we would normally be</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.100" end="02:18:37.860" style="s2">and then you go and so something that betrays me, it&#39;s like bang, that whole simplification is gone</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.860" end="02:18:42.640" style="s2">and all those parts of you that were supposed to be irrelevant, &#39;cause we were playing the same game</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.640" end="02:18:45.540" style="s2">they&#39;re dead relevant, and I don&#39;t know who the hell you are</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.540" end="02:18:48.340" style="s2">and so that&#39;s really rough, and people do not like that</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.340" end="02:18:53.500" style="s2">it&#39;s this emergent mismatch between their desires and the way the world is manifesting itself</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.500" end="02:18:57.020" style="s2">so one of the issues of complexity is that</p>
<p begin="02:18:57.020" end="02:19:05.420" style="s2">when you hit an obstacle, everything that you have agreed with other people to make irrelevant - is relevant</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.420" end="02:19:09.120" style="s2">and that&#39;s generally a disconcerting experience</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.120" end="02:19:15.520" style="s2">now you can, you know, you might wanna toy a little bit with that in a relationship</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.520" end="02:19:19.500" style="s2">maybe you encourage your partner to dress differently or you go do different things or something</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.500" end="02:19:22.600" style="s2">&#39;cause you don&#39;t wanna be stuck in exactly the same old rut</p>
<p begin="02:19:22.600" end="02:19:27.440" style="s2">and so what you&#39;ll agree is how you can both deviate an interesting amount</p>
<p begin="02:19:27.440" end="02:19:35.580" style="s2">but that&#39;s voluntary and controlled, it&#39;s not the same at all as having that little mess of eighty million snakes pop up right in front of you</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.580" end="02:19:39.320" style="s2">which is the last thing you wanna have happen, and so</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.320" end="02:19:45.860" style="s2">it&#39;s so weird, because one of the things that we&#39;re striving to do constatnly is to keep most of the world irrelevant</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.860" end="02:19:53.320" style="s2">and our cultural systems are designed precisely for that purpose, and par of what you do when you disrupt them is</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.320" end="02:20:01.860" style="s2">you force people to consider a far more range of relevance than they are even vaguely comfortable or vaguely comfortable to manage</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.860" end="02:20:03.860" style="s2">and it just burns them to a crisp</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.860" end="02:20:05.860" style="s2">because what your body does is:</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.860" end="02:20:08.240" style="s2">if all of a sudden everything around you is relevant...</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.240" end="02:20:14.500" style="s2">like I could say: &quot;you&#39;re stripped naked, I take you in a helicopter, drop you right into the middle of the jungle at midnight&quot;</p>
<p begin="02:20:14.500" end="02:20:17.340" style="s2">it&#39;s like, you&#39;re not bored</p>
<p begin="02:20:17.340" end="02:20:22.580" style="s2">standing there, frozen, paralyzed, everything is interesting</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.580" end="02:20:29.000" style="s2">well, too bad for you, &#39;cause too interesting is very little different from terrifying, and so</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.000" end="02:20:35.160" style="s2">you know, your heart rate&#39;s gonna be at 160 for like two days, and then something will eat you, and your problems will be over</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.160" end="02:20:39.080" style="s2">alright, so this diagram basically suggests this</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.080" end="02:20:42.760" style="s2">is this is how you break up the world when you&#39;re going from point A to point B</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.760" end="02:20:47.180" style="s2">it renders almost everything irelevant, hooray</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.180" end="02:20:52.840" style="s2">and then what happens is the rest of the world is broken up into obstacles that get in your way</p>
<p begin="02:20:52.840" end="02:20:55.860" style="s2">and tools that facilitate your movement forward</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.860" end="02:20:58.620" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually what you see when you come into a place</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.620" end="02:21:03.440" style="s2">like when you come into this room, these are obstacles insofar as you con&#39;t walk through them</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.440" end="02:21:07.020" style="s2">and those are tools insofar as you can sit on them and watch the class</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.020" end="02:21:12.380" style="s2">and this is a tool, and these are tools, and this is a tool</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.380" end="02:21:14.580" style="s2">and I&#39;m a tool, although I&#39;d never admit it</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.580" end="02:21:23.460" style="s2">but anyways, I&#39;m a tool, because you need to take this class in order to advance towards your degree</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.460" end="02:21:28.260" style="s2">and so, basically what you see inthe world are entities of functional significance</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.260" end="02:21:31.280" style="s2">and those are not objects, they&#39;re not the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:21:31.280" end="02:21:35.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s very much worth considering, because we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.920" end="02:21:43.920" style="s2">build up a case, at least in part, for analyzing the nature of the structure within which you organize your perceptions</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.920" end="02:21:47.600" style="s2">and we tend to think that those are predicated on object perception</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.600" end="02:21:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.600" end="02:21:53.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not true, they&#39;re predicated on relevance conception</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.980" end="02:21:58.180" style="s2">does it help you? does it get in your way? or is it irrelevant?</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.180" end="02:22:07.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what you wanna know; if it helps you, you&#39;re happy about it; if it gets in your way, you&#39;re negatively predisposed towards it; if it&#39;s irrelevant, it&#39;s invisible</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.080" end="02:22:13.020" style="s2">and so, if your little scheme is functional, your little frame is functional</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.020" end="02:22:16.220" style="s2">then most of the things that you encounter are mildly positive</p>
<p begin="02:22:16.220" end="02:22:20.520" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you know that you know what you&#39;re doing, that&#39;s how you validate the entire frame</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.520" end="02:22:23.820" style="s2">so okay, good</p>
