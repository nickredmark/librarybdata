<p begin="00:00:01.490" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">so yesterday we were talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:19.160" style="s2">somebody I think in the comments rightly</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">spoke of the the switch in relation</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.160" end="00:00:30.420" style="s2">between I ate and I thou so when we were</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.710" end="00:00:32.070" style="s2">looking at the eyeball and describing</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.420" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">the eyeball to the other person that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.070" end="00:00:38.390" style="s2">were looking at and then we held our our</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:43.309" style="s2">vision there and then switch from</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.390" end="00:00:43.309" style="s2">looking at their eyeball to seeing them</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.510" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">and feeling that difference right as it</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.730" end="00:00:53.780" style="s2">brings up this mystery</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.950" end="00:01:01.670" style="s2">because it it highlights that way in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.260" end="00:01:05.270" style="s2">which what I think I was trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.670" end="00:01:10.810" style="s2">at before about where the place from</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.270" end="00:01:15.260" style="s2">which the genuine question of being</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.810" end="00:01:24.260" style="s2">resides it being closer to our closer to</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.260" end="00:01:30.860" style="s2">ourselves closer to us than ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.260" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">that our eyeballs bring us the same you</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.860" end="00:01:40.369" style="s2">could say sensations they see they&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:43.640" style="s2">the same place yet what I see is</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.369" end="00:01:47.330" style="s2">completely different when I see thou the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.640" end="00:01:51.890" style="s2">other and what I think that highlights</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.330" end="00:02:01.310" style="s2">is this way in which that can be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.890" end="00:02:06.940" style="s2">analogy or how how being how we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.310" end="00:02:11.270" style="s2">to perceive being given that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.940" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">perceive it through there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.270" end="00:02:20.030" style="s2">about the sense perception itself that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:21.530" style="s2">can say being to you right in other</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.030" end="00:02:23.950" style="s2">words you can&#39;t reduce it down to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.530" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">something else that perception of being</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.950" end="00:02:27.340" style="s2">what is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:41.170" style="s2">so if we look at this sense of I thou</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.420" end="00:02:43.500" style="s2">versus I it and in for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.170" end="00:02:46.810" style="s2">are familiar with Martin Buber you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.500" end="00:02:49.510" style="s2">you&#39;ll recognize this but you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.810" end="00:02:53.560" style="s2">essentially you could say that his</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.510" end="00:02:58.120" style="s2">Boober would say that the being a human</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.560" end="00:03:04.209" style="s2">being essentially is always being in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.120" end="00:03:08.400" style="s2">relation and we are either as he would I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.209" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">think poetically put it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.400" end="00:03:16.870" style="s2">theologically philosophically poetically</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.360" end="00:03:20.290" style="s2">say it is that we&#39;re either in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.870" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">relationship with an an ayat or in an I</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.290" end="00:03:28.680" style="s2">vow essentially we could say that when</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:35.010" style="s2">you&#39;re in a relationship with an ayat</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.680" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">both the I and B it he it is a meet I</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.010" end="00:03:40.930" style="s2">had a phone call that apparently I found</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">out phone calls block they stopped the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.930" end="00:03:52.040" style="s2">video so and I believe I was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:04:00.739" style="s2">saying before the this it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.040" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">rudely interrupted me is the person who</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.739" end="00:04:07.700" style="s2">calls right isn&#39;t it and I&#39;m an I in</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:10.640" style="s2">relationship to it because in some level</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.700" end="00:04:13.340" style="s2">it was a it was a means that got in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.640" end="00:04:17.449" style="s2">way of my ends right therefore it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.340" end="00:04:19.880" style="s2">it and Berber would say that is the that</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.449" end="00:04:24.110" style="s2">is the relation as he would put it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.880" end="00:04:26.210" style="s2">the world of time and space right that</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.110" end="00:04:30.860" style="s2">it&#39;s though it&#39;s the world in which we</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.210" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">function where where the sidewalk is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">means to the end of walking right the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:45.500" style="s2">chair is a meet is a means to sitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:47.780" style="s2">and there&#39;s a certain I that that arises</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.500" end="00:04:50.780" style="s2">with that and he always Boober makes a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.780" end="00:04:54.759" style="s2">real strong point that that I it in I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.780" end="00:04:59.090" style="s2">vow or spoken as one word in other words</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.759" end="00:05:03.020" style="s2">there&#39;s no I out there that then comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.090" end="00:05:06.500" style="s2">together with an it out there no they</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.020" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">arise together it&#39;s always an i it i</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:13.729" style="s2">thou whereas a dow which is much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:18.349" style="s2">difficult to put into language because</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.729" end="00:05:23.889" style="s2">when we ran i&#39;ve our relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.349" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">where that which the i that is with thou</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.889" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">is in boobers words is an end in itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.289" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">it&#39;s another way of saying that using</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.039" end="00:05:44.389" style="s2">Paul Tillich&#39;s language in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.620" end="00:05:48.050" style="s2">it&#39;s like as if we face that of ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.389" end="00:05:51.340" style="s2">concern right that of deepest concern is</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.050" end="00:05:55.419" style="s2">is like it&#39;s like looking the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.340" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">ultimate concern the end in itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.419" end="00:05:59.229" style="s2">directly in its face</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:04.740" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:06.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which it&#39;s spoken is</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.740" end="00:06:10.169" style="s2">one word and you really get this because</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.620" end="00:06:11.879" style="s2">you just look at the times of deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.169" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">connections with other people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.879" end="00:06:20.789" style="s2">you&#39;ve had it starts to explain a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:23.879" style="s2">bit why a simple conversation can change</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.789" end="00:06:26.490" style="s2">your life or a relationship that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.879" end="00:06:29.430" style="s2">have with somebody can radically</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.490" end="00:06:32.009" style="s2">transform the way you experience the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.430" end="00:06:40.979" style="s2">entire universe both positive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.009" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">negatively so the sense of I though the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.979" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">eye becomes through thou and the bow</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.620" end="00:06:52.680" style="s2">becomes through I and Buber would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:55.409" style="s2">that that is I thou doesn&#39;t tap into</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.680" end="00:06:58.050" style="s2">time and space it makes sense right</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.409" end="00:07:00.180" style="s2">because usually those conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.050" end="00:07:06.659" style="s2">are just in those interactions that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.180" end="00:07:09.389" style="s2">so radically life-changing are usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.659" end="00:07:12.990" style="s2">have this character where time</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.389" end="00:07:16.129" style="s2">disappears we go into these radically</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.990" end="00:07:16.129" style="s2">deep flow States</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.559" end="00:07:20.799" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.990" end="00:07:26.169" style="s2">the thing about it is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.060" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">oftentimes people don&#39;t even recognize</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.169" end="00:07:30.979" style="s2">that when they relate to another person</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:34.280" style="s2">they oftentimes you relate to that other</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.979" end="00:07:37.340" style="s2">person isn&#39;t it there&#39;s a means to your</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.280" end="00:07:39.319" style="s2">own end like you like them as long as</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.340" end="00:07:41.630" style="s2">they say what they want as long as they</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.319" end="00:07:46.849" style="s2">don&#39;t call you when you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.630" end="00:07:49.610" style="s2">shoot a video right then it reveals like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.849" end="00:07:52.039" style="s2">actually no you&#39;re a means to my own end</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.610" end="00:07:55.340" style="s2">or on a much more subtler level like I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.039" end="00:07:59.389" style="s2">can relate to the other as a means to my</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.340" end="00:08:02.780" style="s2">own end of approval or acceptance or</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.389" end="00:08:06.530" style="s2">narcissistic reflection there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.780" end="00:08:08.840" style="s2">kinds of ways in which we can subtly be</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.530" end="00:08:18.530" style="s2">in an i it relationship with another</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.840" end="00:08:20.270" style="s2">human being so when we in boobers pretty</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.530" end="00:08:23.479" style="s2">you know and I think this is also</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.270" end="00:08:25.960" style="s2">telling it&#39;s it&#39;s not that I though</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.479" end="00:08:28.009" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be with the vow doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.960" end="00:08:31.460" style="s2">necessarily have to be with another</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.009" end="00:08:35.240" style="s2">person he probably also had moments with</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.460" end="00:08:40.180" style="s2">sunsets with in a moments of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">where the world stops right even tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.180" end="00:08:50.180" style="s2">when the tragic and the truest sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">the word I think can be one of deep down</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.180" end="00:08:52.630" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.220" end="00:09:01.740" style="s2">so the thing to get about this and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.710" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">and and this is this why boobers this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.740" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">what this part of boobers work has</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.930" end="00:09:09.810" style="s2">always spoken to me is because in some</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:14.400" style="s2">way it starts to really articulate why I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.810" end="00:09:16.680" style="s2">been circling for 22 years right why</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.400" end="00:09:18.090" style="s2">people have been doing this how it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.680" end="00:09:21.180" style="s2">spread all over the worlds like what</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.090" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">well what&#39;s going on right I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.180" end="00:09:29.790" style="s2">something like this and what you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:35.010" style="s2">notice and I think that the part of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.790" end="00:09:39.720" style="s2">that&#39;s it so personally developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.010" end="00:09:44.090" style="s2">rich and liberating and transforming is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.720" end="00:09:47.010" style="s2">that you can feel when you go from</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.090" end="00:09:49.980" style="s2">relating to somebody or something as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.010" end="00:09:54.180" style="s2">it you can feel that when you start to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.980" end="00:09:57.180" style="s2">shift just like you shifted from looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.180" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">at the eyeball to seeing them when you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.180" end="00:10:04.230" style="s2">make that shift and you they become thou</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:07.010" style="s2">you that&#39;s there&#39;s a corollary I that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.230" end="00:10:09.840" style="s2">you become in relationship to that thou</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.010" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a different I that arises with</p>
