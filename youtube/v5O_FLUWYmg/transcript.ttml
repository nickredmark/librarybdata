<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:20.420" style="s2">Jordan - Dr. Warren Farrell is the author of books published in seventeen languages.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.420" end="00:00:24.460" style="s2"> Including two award-winning international best sellers:</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.460" end="00:00:29.080" style="s2"> Why Men Are Like That and The Myth of Male Power</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.360" end="00:00:36.220" style="s2"> Warren has been chosen by the Financial Times as one of the leading thinkers of the top hundred.</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.220" end="00:00:41.300" style="s2"> He is currently Chairman of the Commission to Create a White House Council on Boys and Men.</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.300" end="00:00:44.780" style="s2"> He is the only man in America who has been elected three times.</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.780" end="00:00:50.080" style="s2"> for the Board of the National Organization for Women, ONM, in New York City.</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.080" end="00:00:54.900" style="s2"> Dr. Farrel has been featured repeatedly on Oprah, Today, and Good Morning America</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.900" end="00:01:02.500" style="s2"> and has been featured in 20/20, Forbes, The Wall Street Journal, People, Parade, and The New York Times.</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.020" end="00:01:06.220" style="s2"> The co-author of his new book is Dr. John Gray,</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.220" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2"> the author of Men Come from Mars, Women Come from Venus.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.440" end="00:01:12.040" style="s2"> Again, this is the book.</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.040" end="00:01:16.640" style="s2"> We are going to talk, not only about the book today, the new one, The Boys&#39; Crisis,</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.640" end="00:01:20.680" style="s2"> but also the career of Dr. Farrell and his goals and all that,</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.680" end="00:01:23.740" style="s2"> so I would love to introduce you to Dr. Warren Farrel</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.740" end="00:01:26.320" style="s2"> and ask you to tell us what your intentions are and why.</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.560" end="00:01:34.040" style="s2"> Warren - I suppose that my intentions are to see the evolution of perhaps all that time since 1969.</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.040" end="00:01:37.400" style="s2"> When the feminist movement emerged I was very interested in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.400" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2"> and I felt that women really needed to be able to be equally respected</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:43.140" style="s2"> and enter the workplace and have options open</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.140" end="00:01:46.700" style="s2"> and he was upset that women weren&#39;t playing sports</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.720" end="00:01:52.180" style="s2"> to the degree that I felt that these sports were creating benefits for them.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.180" end="00:01:53.820" style="s2"> I started to articulate this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.820" end="00:02:00.180" style="s2"> and I started talking to my dissertation advisers about doing this and their first reaction was:</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.180" end="00:02:02.140" style="s2"> &quot;Warren, the women&#39;s movement is just a fad,&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.140" end="00:02:05.560" style="s2"> and I said: &quot;I think not, I think this is the beginning of change</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.560" end="00:02:08.340" style="s2"> of the gender roles of men and women &quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:14.100" style="s2"> I talked to them about this and finally convinced them that I could change my dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:20.460" style="s2"> and that led me to be seen now as a receptive man</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.460" end="00:02:22.640" style="s2"> at a time when the feminist movement</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.640" end="00:02:25.960" style="s2"> I was getting a lot of accusations of hating men</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.960" end="00:02:33.260" style="s2"> so I served the purpose that here is a man of flesh and blood who stands up for what we stand for,</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.260" end="00:02:37.540" style="s2"> gets up and says what we say, it&#39;s going to be harder to label them &quot;man haters.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.540" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2"> I started doing that so I started doing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:43.940" style="s2"> And I ended up talking all over the world about women&#39;s issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.940" end="00:02:48.240" style="s2"> and the value of women having sufficient confidence and competence</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.240" end="00:02:52.080" style="s2"> to be able to share the burdens of earning the bread that men have.</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.080" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2"> And that was my focus until the mid-seventies</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:03:02.220" style="s2"> and in the mid-seventies I began to see that the feminist movement had made a lot of progress</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.220" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2"> and everyone was signing up, at least those who were high up in the middle class and educated.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.060" end="00:03:17.240" style="s2"> But there were also a huge number of divorces going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.240" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2"> and I started to say that it is important for the children</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2"> having both parents after the divorce.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.560" end="00:03:27.880" style="s2"> Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem and a woman named Karen DeCrowe agreed with me</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.880" end="00:03:31.840" style="s2"> but the ONM, I was on the ONM Board at the time,</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.840" end="00:03:36.660" style="s2"> had been elected as a result of work for the Board of ONM</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.660" end="00:03:43.320" style="s2"> and my colleagues on the current Board said:</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.320" end="00:03:44.740" style="s2"> &quot;We have a dilemma</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.740" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2"> and the dilemma is that there are women who are writing to us saying that they are going to leave the ONJ</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:54.580" style="s2"> if they do not have the option to determine what happens to the children after the divorce</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.580" end="00:04:01.040" style="s2"> and we don&#39;t want to lose members because it&#39;s not only important for family purposes</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.040" end="00:04:03.020" style="s2"> but for the rest of the agendas we have. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.020" end="00:04:08.420" style="s2"> I said: &quot;The important thing is not the rights of women or men,</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.420" end="00:04:10.760" style="s2"> the important thing is to know what is best for the children &quot;,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.760" end="00:04:14.760" style="s2"> and they said, &quot;Yeah Warren, cool theory, but we really need to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.760" end="00:04:17.480" style="s2"> empower women across a broad spectrum. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.480" end="00:04:20.740" style="s2"> They ended up voting in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.740" end="00:04:24.340" style="s2"> give women the option to be fully involved with their children</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.340" end="00:04:29.900" style="s2"> or not to depend on the appearance that women are the ones who know their children best</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:32.020" style="s2"> and therefore they know what is best for their children.</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.020" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2"> So the ONJ and I started to have a significant amount of tension around that idea.</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.980" style="s2"> and Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem didn&#39;t get involved, they weren&#39;t on the ONM Board.</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.980" end="00:04:44.500" style="s2"> All the other NOM Boards of the country</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.500" end="00:04:47.980" style="s2"> started down the path taken by the New York City Board</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.980" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2"> and that led to my departure and I also started forming hundreds of men&#39;s groups,</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:58.340" style="s2"> one of whom was joined by John Lennon,</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.340" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2"> and that had a huge impact on people in both groups and I started to see what men&#39;s pain was.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:13.620" style="s2"> I began to articulate the pain of men as well as that of women in my presentations</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.620" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2"> And when I was only articulating the pain of women and the challenges of women,</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:21.140" style="s2"> would almost always receive big ovations</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.140" end="00:05:26.200" style="s2"> and maybe an average of three invitations for a new lecture opportunity.</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.200" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2"> That was helping me live very well financially but then,</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:34.460" style="s2"> when I began to integrate the perspectives and feelings of men from men&#39;s groups,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.460" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t see those big cheers.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2"> -Why not?</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2"> - [..] for new conference opportunities it went from three, to two, to one and finally to zero.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2"> -It seems obvious in some sense that if you are articulating truthfully and carefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2"> what would be good for either sex,</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2"> in a sense you have to be articulating what would be good for both of you.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2"> If you see reality as a battlefield between the sexes and as a zero-sum game,</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:09.060" style="s2"> we can&#39;t have a smart conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.060" end="00:06:12.380" style="s2"> about what is good for women or what is good for men.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.380" end="00:06:16.660" style="s2"> We have to have a conversation about what is good for men, and men and women,</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.660" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2"> and for women, and men and women.</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:29.640" style="s2"> What reason did you intuit was the reason why when you talked about these issues you were unpopular?</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.640" end="00:06:32.740" style="s2"> Two questions: why do you think that made you unpopular?</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.740" end="00:06:41.020" style="s2"> And why did you observe so early that there was something that wasn&#39;t exactly kosher</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:47.660" style="s2"> in relation to the ONJ promoting a particular type of family structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.660" end="00:06:50.260" style="s2"> and a particular vision of the Rights of Women?</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:54.300" style="s2"> -I think what happened to me was ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.380" end="00:07:01.540" style="s2"> When I started to focus on what was best for children and then I started to ...</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.540" end="00:07:04.520" style="s2"> We only had a minimal amount of research at the time,</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.520" end="00:07:06.100" style="s2"> early seventies</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.100" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2"> But we had enough so that I could talk to the Board and when I saw the resistance, the degree ...</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.400" end="00:07:15.540" style="s2"> Two things were happening:</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.540" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2"> One is we don&#39;t want to lose our fan base.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2"> We never want a woman saying whatever option she wants will be closed to her.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2"> So I begin to see that the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:31.660" style="s2"> he cares more about women than children.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.660" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2"> That was the first disappointment I had.</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2"> -Your first ethical reason, in a sense, is that when you are talking about families</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:45.320" style="s2"> and you have to balance the rights and responsibilities of men, women and children,</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2"> it makes sense for you to put the welfare of children first</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:56.600" style="s2"> and then that of men and women as individuals or perhaps even as a couple below that.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.600" end="00:08:01.480" style="s2"> -Yes, exactly what I was saying is that freedom of choice is wonderful.</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.480" end="00:08:05.760" style="s2"> But when you exercise your freedom of choice to have a child,</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.760" end="00:08:09.160" style="s2"> then you begin to prioritize the child&#39;s needs.</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:13.420" style="s2"> And you knew those needs were going to be the child&#39;s needs first</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.420" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2"> when you made that free choice.</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:21.240" style="s2"> It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve been coerced or pressured into making that choice.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.240" end="00:08:23.600" style="s2"> You freely chose to have a child</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.600" end="00:08:29.940" style="s2"> that incorporates the need to put the child&#39;s perspective before yours, that is part of your free choice.</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:36.860" style="s2"> -The freedom there is the freedom to accept a certain type of relatively permanent responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2"> and then stick to that, come hell or storm essentially, from now on.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:44.460" style="s2"> -That children should not respect the needs of their parents,</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.460" end="00:08:46.940" style="s2"> because part of what I&#39;ve talked about in La Crisis de los Chicos is that ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.940" end="00:08:51.720" style="s2"> Everyone has to be happy in a family</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.720" end="00:08:55.480" style="s2"> and part of choosing (having) a child to be responsible</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.480" end="00:08:59.100" style="s2"> is to choose the child not only to have their needs met</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.100" end="00:09:05.020" style="s2"> but also worry about what their mothers and fathers need as well.</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.020" end="00:09:09.860" style="s2"> And that has to be primary and introduced early.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:16.760" style="s2"> And on the other hand, I also felt and Betty Friedan too,</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.760" end="00:09:21.460" style="s2"> that the women&#39;s movement would never go as far as it could</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.460" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2"> Unless men were equally involved</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2"> and proud to be involved in the role of father because a woman ..</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:34.100" style="s2"> A woman who wants to break glass ceilings</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.100" end="00:09:37.420" style="s2"> and go as far as he can but he also wants to have children</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.420" end="00:09:39.960" style="s2"> can&#39;t do everything if the man is working full time</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.960" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2"> and she is working full time</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:43.260" style="s2"> or the children are abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.260" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2"> or something has to change.</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:48.700" style="s2"> Women often tell me:</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.700" end="00:09:51.980" style="s2"> &quot;I want to be a great woman&quot; and I say, &quot;You can be a great woman.</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.980" end="00:09:58.420" style="s2"> Find a man who wants to be at home all the time with the children and let&#39;s reorganize society.</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:06.100" style="s2"> We say that men are not only warriors we praise and call heroes</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.100" end="00:10:08.300" style="s2"> when they go to war and die for us</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.300" end="00:10:14.200" style="s2"> they are also warriors if you choose a man who wants to be fully involved with the son.</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.200" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2"> Let us honor and respect him because we know that the social bribes we gave to men to die</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.260" end="00:10:25.900" style="s2"> They allowed them to be willing to sacrifice their lives in exchange for being called a hero.</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.900" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2"> If we rethink being a parent as being a different kind of hero,</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.080" style="s2"> Men will follow, because men basically go where the praise goes.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:41.320" style="s2"> -So in the seventies you began to promote the case of the children,</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.320" end="00:10:44.860" style="s2"> and also to some degree simultaneously, the case of parents</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.860" end="00:10:48.580" style="s2"> and you received some resistance as a result of that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.580" end="00:10:53.700" style="s2"> It sounds like the way you are organizing the argument is that the conflict ..</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.700" end="00:10:55.260" style="s2"> What was the conflict?</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.260" end="00:10:59.400" style="s2"> Was it that the women who were being attracted to the ONJ</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.400" end="00:11:04.380" style="s2"> did they want unlimited freedom of choice for themselves in all circumstances?</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.380" end="00:11:07.820" style="s2"> The reason I ask is because if you have children,</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.820" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2"> obviously half of the children you have are women</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:13.220" style="s2"> And you would assume that if it were a question of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.220" end="00:11:19.740" style="s2"> women open up to what is best for women in any way in the medium to long term,</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.740" end="00:11:23.580" style="s2"> that the concerns about daughters would be perhaps,</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.580" end="00:11:25.400" style="s2"> even if they are not concerns about children,</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.400" end="00:11:30.360" style="s2"> it would be the concerns about daughters that would take precedence over the concerns of the mother.</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.420" end="00:11:39.000" style="s2"> I still don&#39;t understand I understand why you weren&#39;t succeeding, because it doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.480" end="00:11:43.700" style="s2"> -There were two things happening simultaneously,</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.700" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2"> one was a very strong emphasis on freedom, and it manifested itself in two areas. One was the area of ​​divorce.</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:53.020" style="s2"> In divorces, women frequently said:</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.020" end="00:11:55.800" style="s2"> I don&#39;t like my husband, I want to start a new life,</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2"> I want to be able to change state if I want to get a job that I want.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:09.480" style="s2"> Or: my new husband or boyfriend wants to leave the State and I want my children or son to come with me because ...</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.480" end="00:12:15.220" style="s2"> And I know what is best for my son, which would be like the medical community saying:</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.220" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2"> we don&#39;t want women to participate in the medical community</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:20.300" style="s2"> because we know what is better for the patient</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:25.380" style="s2"> and not that women could make a separate contribution.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.380" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2"> On the other hand there were women who wanted to have freedom</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2"> to be able to have children without being married</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:37.520" style="s2"> so fifty-three percent of women under thirty today,</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.520" end="00:12:41.040" style="s2"> who have children in the US, have children without being married</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.040" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2"> and the belief was, again, that women knew what was best for children</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:47.960" style="s2"> so they could accept the challenge if they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.960" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2"> and if they didn&#39;t find a man they wanted to be with, they could raise the child or children on their own.</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.020" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2"> -Part of that was driven by questioning the need for the nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2"> as the smallest viable unit and part of ..</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:05.680" style="s2"> -A) That is correct and B),</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.680" end="00:13:08.420" style="s2"> the feminist community started ..</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.960" end="00:13:14.260" style="s2"> When I went to feminist meetings there were many books about Lenin</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.260" end="00:13:21.460" style="s2"> and the nuclear family being the (?) patriarchal who was oppressing women.</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.460" end="00:13:28.040" style="s2"> I think the feminist movement developed out of two huge iterations:</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.040" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2"> one was the Civil Rights Movement, in which there was an oppressor and an oppressed.</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:43.620" style="s2"> Then it was the civil rights movement not only but after this movement came along,</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.620" end="00:13:50.400" style="s2"> Marxism arrived and the belief that they were oppressed and oppressors, among Marxists.</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.400" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2"> And much of the feminist movement, early feminism.</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.080" end="00:13:56.820" style="s2"> We had groups like Redstockings and many other groups like that,</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.820" end="00:13:59.180" style="s2"> there were feminists of the Socialist Workers Party style,</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.180" end="00:14:05.200" style="s2"> who believed in Marxism and had the dichotomy of oppressor versus oppressed.</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.200" end="00:14:07.160" style="s2"> So when you had to explain to men,</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.160" end="00:14:14.120" style="s2"> because we earn more because our biological and socialized responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.120" end="00:14:18.260" style="s2"> is to earn money and provide that way,</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.260" end="00:14:22.040" style="s2"> the feminist movement saw the fact that we made more money</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.040" end="00:14:24.500" style="s2"> once we had kids so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.500" end="00:14:31.060" style="s2"> we must be oppressors like the bourgeois of Marxism and women must be the oppressed.</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.060" end="00:14:33.460" style="s2"> You have two things happening simultaneously:</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.460" end="00:14:39.000" style="s2"> this belief that oppressors want to be equally involved with children</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.000" end="00:14:45.180" style="s2"> and that, second, the men had no idea why they were worth;</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.180" end="00:14:53.080" style="s2"> third, the few men who studied the value of being a father and how important it was to children,</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.080" end="00:14:57.060" style="s2"> they did not speak and women cannot hear what men do not say</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.060" end="00:15:03.760" style="s2"> so we had this world where women were sharing the burden of earning their bread</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.760" end="00:15:07.800" style="s2"> but no one was interested in asking</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.800" end="00:15:15.280" style="s2"> whether men could share the burden of women in providing equally for the family</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.280" end="00:15:19.980" style="s2"> and women weren&#39;t even interested in that because they were so focused on their freedom</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.980" end="00:15:21.840" style="s2"> and they saw men as oppressors,</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.840" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2"> so there was no room to articulate the value of parents in a family.</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.320" end="00:15:31.600" style="s2"> -Your terminology is interesting also because</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.600" end="00:15:38.040" style="s2"> you&#39;re attributing the desire of the women they were pushing against what you were saying, say,</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.040" end="00:15:41.980" style="s2"> you are attributing it to a desire for freedom</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.980" end="00:15:47.100" style="s2"> but it seems to me that you could easily use irresponsibility as terminology there.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.100" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2"> Because freedom without interest in the medium to long-term consequences of your actions, especially,</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:00.100" style="s2"> when you are communicating with minors,</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.100" end="00:16:04.020" style="s2"> when you are communicating with children, that is not freedom, that is irresponsibility.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.880" end="00:16:07.140" style="s2"> -That&#39;s absolutely irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.140" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2"> And that&#39;s where we as a society have failed to say:</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2"> first, when either sex wins, that is, a woman gets custody, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:20.700" style="s2"> when either sex wins, both sexes lose.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.700" end="00:16:22.040" style="s2"> And it&#39;s worse than that:</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.040" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2"> when either sex wins, both sexes lose and in the case of the family, the children lose enormously.</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:34.520" style="s2"> And we also need to understand what exactly it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.520" end="00:16:40.180" style="s2"> which leads to children doing better when they have parents involved.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.180" end="00:16:44.380" style="s2"> I started to investigate that and in La Crisis de los Chicos</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.380" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2"> I collected over seventy different ways that when children have their father involved</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:54.700" style="s2"> significantly, they do much better.</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.700" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2"> -It would be great if you could detail some now and then we go back to ideological political history.</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.300" end="00:17:06.620" style="s2"> One of the things that happened in Ontario recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.620" end="00:17:13.340" style="s2"> is that our government has introduced legislation</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.340" end="00:17:17.040" style="s2"> which is based on the idea that all families are equal</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.040" end="00:17:21.880" style="s2"> and the idea behind that, you could argue, is laudable ..</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.880" end="00:17:24.980" style="s2"> I wouldn&#39;t argue but you could argue</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.980" end="00:17:31.240" style="s2"> that people have a variety of ways of solving the problem of having children</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.240" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2"> and that there are a variety of viable solutions to that problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:41.540" style="s2"> and that no type of family organization should be privileged above the rest,</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.540" end="00:17:45.300" style="s2"> I guess with the exception of multi-spouse marriages</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.300" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2"> the ones we haven&#39;t yet approved of, let&#39;s say.</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.160" end="00:17:51.620" style="s2"> The problem with that, as far as I understand,</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.620" end="00:17:57.820" style="s2"> is that it appears from research that the nuclear family is the most viable small unit,</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.820" end="00:18:01.940" style="s2"> which is not to say there are no single mothers or fathers</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.940" end="00:18:04.560" style="s2"> do an admirable job in harsh conditions</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.560" end="00:18:07.660" style="s2"> but part of the problem, is a deep problem, is that ...</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:13.380" style="s2"> When you propose something as a value, you could say:</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.380" end="00:18:16.680" style="s2"> we want intact families, mother and father.</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.680" end="00:18:20.520" style="s2"> That is the value we are targeting because it seems to be the best for the children,</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.520" end="00:18:23.540" style="s2"> then you produce a hierarchy according to that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.540" end="00:18:26.060" style="s2"> and the people who do not conform to that value,</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.060" end="00:18:29.100" style="s2"> you can easily argue that they are being discriminated against</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.100" end="00:18:35.700" style="s2"> And we are in a situation in our society now where even if discrimination occurs, say,</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.700" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2"> for the achievement of admirable value,</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:40.040" style="s2"> is seen as prejudicial</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.040" end="00:18:46.580" style="s2"> and I think that is intensified by the underlying hypothesis that it was anti nuclear family</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.580" end="00:18:51.160" style="s2"> in which any kind of hierarchical structure is part of the tyrannical patriarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.340" end="00:18:53.260" style="s2"> it is something like this that underlies.</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:55.680" style="s2"> Anyway, let&#39;s check, if you want,</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.680" end="00:18:57.620" style="s2"> I think it would be of great help to everyone,</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.620" end="00:18:59.220" style="s2"> some of the many ways that</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.220" end="00:19:01.880" style="s2"> it is necessary for children to have parents,</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.880" end="00:19:06.500" style="s2"> Why is that better? And maybe for society too, not just for children.</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2"> -Absolutely.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:12.340" style="s2"> Girls and boys whose parents have been significantly involved</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.340" end="00:19:14.560" style="s2"> they have a number of things in common as a rule,</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.560" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2"> and obviously there are investments and not everyone manifests this pattern,</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:25.620" style="s2"> but the first is that they are much more likely to postpone satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.620" end="00:19:27.760" style="s2"> and I&#39;ll elaborate on that a little bit more.</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.760" end="00:19:34.360" style="s2"> Postponing satisfaction is probably the most important quality for being successful,</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.360" end="00:19:40.020" style="s2"> and be successful especially having a job that has meaning for you,</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.020" end="00:19:44.440" style="s2"> it is one of the most important ingredients to be happy</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.440" end="00:19:45.620" style="s2"> and a sense of purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:47.260" style="s2"> and a sense of motivation</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.260" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2"> and a sense of being willing to get up in the morning.</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.280" end="00:19:56.420" style="s2"> So in a moment I&#39;ll tell how postponing satisfaction happens more when you have a father.</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.560" end="00:19:59.080" style="s2"> -Yes, because I&#39;m very interested in hearing about it.</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.500" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2"> Second, in this way the father engages with the children significantly</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:06.120" style="s2"> children are less likely to be depressed;</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.120" end="00:20:10.320" style="s2"> they are more likely to be assertive and not aggressive,</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.320" end="00:20:14.160" style="s2"> that you normally think men are aggressive,</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.160" end="00:20:19.000" style="s2"> but it is more likely that both girls and boys whose parents are involved</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.000" end="00:20:24.620" style="s2"> understand the distinction between being assertive and aggressive and choose assertiveness.</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.660" end="00:20:30.580" style="s2"> Another thing that surprised me while doing the research was to find that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.580" end="00:20:37.620" style="s2"> boys and girls who have been raised with the father involved are more likely to be empathetic.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.620" end="00:20:40.680" style="s2"> Because I always thought of empathy coming predominantly from mothers,</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.680" end="00:20:45.160" style="s2"> and in a moment I&#39;ll explain why more comes from mothers</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.160" end="00:20:49.040" style="s2"> but why is the result for the child not more empathy,</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.040" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2"> the result for the son is less empathy, I&#39;ll explain a little more about that later.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.180" end="00:21:00.640" style="s2"> Boys and girls are more likely to drop out of classes if the father does not participate;</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.640" end="00:21:04.720" style="s2"> much more likely when a relationship breaks down,</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.720" end="00:21:10.300" style="s2"> a child who has not had significant parental involvement is much more likely to be depressed</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.300" end="00:21:13.060" style="s2"> and isolate yourself and feel alienated;</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.800" end="00:21:16.440" style="s2"> more likely to have a video game addiction;</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.440" end="00:21:18.780" style="s2"> more likely to be addicted to video pornography;</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.780" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2"> much less likely to have social, emotional skills;</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:30.440" style="s2"> do worse in each academic area but especially in reading and writing,</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.440" end="00:21:32.980" style="s2"> which are the two great predictions of being successful;</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.980" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2"> more likely to have a low sperm count;</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:41.560" style="s2"> And this is a mind-blowing thing that I found out towards the end of the Boys&#39; Crisis investigation,</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.560" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2"> I saw in Pediatrics magazine that children who at age nine</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:51.460" style="s2"> do not have a significant amount of parental involvement,</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.460" end="00:21:55.300" style="s2"> both boys and girls were more likely to have shorter telomeres</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.300" end="00:21:57.140" style="s2"> and as most of us know,</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.140" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2"> telomeres are critical in predicting life expectancy.</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.840" end="00:22:10.360" style="s2"> The mean short telomere for a nine-year-old boy or girl without parental involvement</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.360" end="00:22:16.160" style="s2"> it was fourteen percent shorter.</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.160" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2"> But the telomeres of the boys were forty percent shorter than those of the girls,</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2"> so this was predicting about fourteen percent less life expectancy</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.140" end="00:22:29.920" style="s2"> for the middle child without parent involvement</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.920" end="00:22:31.800" style="s2"> at the age of nine</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.800" end="00:22:34.100" style="s2"> and yet the boys were suffering more.</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.100" end="00:22:36.540" style="s2"> Two things fascinated me there,</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.540" end="00:22:43.340" style="s2"> if all the things like dropping out and things like that, I wonder,</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.340" end="00:22:49.300" style="s2"> maybe this is because the kids whose parents participated simply have better neighborhoods,</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.300" end="00:22:53.220" style="s2"> parents earn more, families earn more.</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.220" end="00:22:55.400" style="s2"> Maybe it&#39;s a question of poverty versus no poverty</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.400" end="00:22:58.920" style="s2"> So I started looking at the boys and girls</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.920" end="00:23:02.760" style="s2"> who were growing up in &quot;good neighborhoods&quot; with &quot;good schools&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.760" end="00:23:07.340" style="s2"> and comparing them with boys and girls growing up in poor neighborhoods, in poor schools,</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.340" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2"> and I saw that the boys and girls</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2"> growing up in good neighborhoods with poor schools that did not have significant father involvement</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2"> they had grown up just like boys and girls growing up in slums with poor schools</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2"> that they did have the father&#39;s participation.</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:27.920" style="s2"> That father&#39;s involvement was really such a good prediction of success</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.920" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2"> like the quality of the school,</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:33.620" style="s2"> like the quality of the neighborhood and the socioeconomic class.</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.800" end="00:23:41.660" style="s2"> This is what has led to psychologists rallying behind people like Warshaw (?),</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.660" end="00:23:45.060" style="s2"> one hundred psychologists and researchers saying:</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.060" end="00:23:48.100" style="s2"> this is not a correlation, parent involvement.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.100" end="00:23:51.040" style="s2"> This is not a question of socio-economic issues;</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.040" end="00:23:56.180" style="s2"> this is a question of parent involvement,</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.180" end="00:23:58.680" style="s2"> especially the involvement of the biological father,</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.680" end="00:24:01.500" style="s2"> it actually makes a significant difference.</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.500" end="00:24:05.260" style="s2"> We were wrong on the assumption that this was probably just a correlation.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.260" end="00:24:17.560" style="s2"> The more I looked, the more terrible parents I encountered when the parent was not meaningfully involved.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.560" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2"> Before I married Liz, the woman you just met just before you started,</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:27.800" style="s2"> before we were married fourteen years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.800" end="00:24:29.880" style="s2"> I&#39;ve been dating a number of women.</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.880" end="00:24:39.220" style="s2"> Almost all of them were single mothers and each woman was working her ass off trying to balance her life.</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.220" end="00:24:43.160" style="s2"> Each woman used the word in awe of the way she felt,</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.160" end="00:24:48.120" style="s2"> almost every woman said: I like that the father participates but,</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.120" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2"> and I started to hear the buts of women</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:58.300" style="s2"> and to listen to men who had wanted to be more involved with their children</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.300" end="00:25:03.640" style="s2"> and hear what the differences were between what made men feel like they didn&#39;t need them,</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.640" end="00:25:09.800" style="s2"> what made them feel left out and why the women felt they needed not to involve the father</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.800" end="00:25:13.860" style="s2"> And I saw this bunch of misunderstandings</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.860" end="00:25:18.040" style="s2"> and if I hope La Crisis de los Chicos does something, it is to explain:</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.040" end="00:25:22.040" style="s2"> here are the ten most important things parents do,</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.040" end="00:25:25.200" style="s2"> or make women feel like they are not protecting their children adequately</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.200" end="00:25:29.420" style="s2"> or make women feel like they are not protecting their children adequately</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.420" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2"> that when they understand the purpose of these things</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:35.280" style="s2"> And when the parents have done their homework long enough</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.280" end="00:25:38.700" style="s2"> as to articulate for mothers the purpose of these things,</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.700" end="00:25:43.820" style="s2"> we will realize that these things are necessary ingredients in the life of a girl or boy.</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.820" end="00:25:46.040" style="s2"> -That&#39;s a good place to go.</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.040" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2"> You have described a number of reasons,</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2"> a number of consequences of fatherlessness</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:56.620" style="s2"> and we will return to the causal relationship between what men do</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.620" end="00:26:03.480" style="s2"> and its beneficial results but if you could tell us what men do at the microscopic level</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.480" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2"> then we can go back to the causal link between that and the positive results</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:11.140" style="s2"> And you said those caused problems at home too.</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.280" end="00:26:14.420" style="s2"> -Yes, an example would be:</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.420" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2"> the father is making a fuss with the children and the mother is looking around and thinking:</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:25.380" style="s2"> When should i interfere? When should it not interfere?</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.380" end="00:26:27.020" style="s2"> And the mother saying:</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.600" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2"> &quot;Jimmy, please, keep the children away from the sideboard, keep them away from the sofa</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:37.060" style="s2"> because they could hit their heads there.</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.620" end="00:26:43.680" style="s2"> Why don&#39;t you wait for tomorrow when you can go outside? I would feel better &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.680" end="00:26:48.420" style="s2"> and the mother is thinking that she should not overprotect</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.420" end="00:26:57.660" style="s2"> and that at the same time he feels that he has to watch over the husband as he does over the husband with the children, and thinks:</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.660" end="00:27:05.080" style="s2"> &quot;Sooner or later an accident is going to happen and I&#39;m going to get mad at myself for not being more strict,</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.080" end="00:27:08.900" style="s2"> but on the other hand, it seems that the children are having a good time so I should leave them to theirs. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.900" end="00:27:12.620" style="s2"> -There is a psychobiologist named Jaak Panksepp</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.620" end="00:27:15.760" style="s2"> who is one of the best biological psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.760" end="00:27:20.160" style="s2"> and studied dramatic play in animals.</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.160" end="00:27:25.420" style="s2"> Rats, for example, a large part of the socialization process,</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.420" end="00:27:30.760" style="s2"> which is key to the development of the prefrontal cortex in juvenile male rats in particular,</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.760" end="00:27:34.560" style="s2"> emerges and matures as a consequence of dramatic play.</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.560" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2"> And one of the things that Panksepp discovered,</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:44.620" style="s2"> and this is really a mind-blowing thing is that if you pair two rats</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.620" end="00:27:47.400" style="s2"> and you let them play repeatedly,</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.400" end="00:27:51.160" style="s2"> the big rat will dominate the little rat to begin with,</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.160" end="00:27:52.800" style="s2"> in the first fight.</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.800" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2"> But if the big rat doesn&#39;t let the little rat win</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:28:00.340" style="s2"> like thirty percent of the time repeatedly, then the little rat won&#39;t play anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.700" end="00:28:04.840" style="s2"> What results is an emerging game-centered morality,</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.840" end="00:28:08.220" style="s2"> even among rats, as a consequence of dramatic games.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.220" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2"> I did a fair amount of research on dramatic games, twenty or fifteen years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:20.900" style="s2"> and it is really clear that dramatic play helps children know the parameters of their bodies;</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.900" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2"> so they know how much they spread</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:28.360" style="s2"> and also what limits are there in physical interactions with another person;</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.360" end="00:28:34.400" style="s2"> what is fun, provocative, what is taking it too far, what is painful;</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.400" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2"> and of course children love to play too.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:39.660" style="s2"> They die to play</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.660" end="00:28:45.180" style="s2"> and we have taken it from kindergartens, Primary education, Secondary</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.180" end="00:28:47.420" style="s2"> and we have prohibited it.</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.420" end="00:28:49.700" style="s2"> And what Panksepp also discovered was</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.700" end="00:28:55.580" style="s2"> that if you eliminated opportunities for juvenile rats to participate in dramatic play,</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.620" end="00:29:02.900" style="s2"> would show symptoms that would be analogous to attention deficit disorder in human boys</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.900" end="00:29:08.020" style="s2"> and that you could treat it with Ritalin in the same way in rats as in boys.</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.020" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2"> That theme of dramatic games ..</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:14.800" style="s2"> You might also think, a question is:</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.800" end="00:29:20.680" style="s2"> Why might a mother distrust dramatic games?</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.680" end="00:29:24.460" style="s2"> And part of that could be boy sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.460" end="00:29:30.220" style="s2"> but a big part of that is also her confidence in the father,</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.220" end="00:29:32.400" style="s2"> because they make a lot of noise and fuss,</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.400" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2"> And if you trust that act of masculinity that plays hard</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:41.260" style="s2"> then she will stay out of the way and let the fun happen.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.260" end="00:29:43.560" style="s2"> But if there is mistrust in the family,</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.560" end="00:29:47.380" style="s2"> then she will be between the children and the father</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.380" end="00:29:49.720" style="s2"> And he won&#39;t get involved that way</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.720" end="00:29:53.560" style="s2"> and then it will disconnect and I have seen that happen in many families.</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.560" end="00:29:58.200" style="s2"> There is the dramatic game, that is important, what else do you see?</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.940" end="00:30:03.080" style="s2"> -Let me develop the evolution of how these games work, all dimensions,</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.080" end="00:30:05.940" style="s2"> the slippery slope it leads to (its lack).</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.940" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2"> What neither the mother nor the father know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2"> is that these dramatic games lead to the kind of things you just mentioned,</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2"> which are also evident in elephants and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:25.400" style="s2"> It also leads to the distinction in which a child is able to distinguish between assertiveness and violence.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.400" end="00:30:27.820" style="s2"> So the child begins, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.820" end="00:30:30.760" style="s2"> to kick the father in an inappropriate place</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.760" end="00:30:33.940" style="s2"> or putting a finger in his eye or pulling his hair and the father says:</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.940" end="00:30:38.500" style="s2"> &quot;You can fake eye contact to the left</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.500" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2"> and then move to the right to win this match</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:43.680" style="s2"> Or you can do this, this and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.680" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2"> but you can&#39;t do these things and if you do these things, we will end the game. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2"> -There is a very important issue, two things there:</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:30:57.720" style="s2"> imagine one of these fights is like a dance</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.720" end="00:31:03.500" style="s2"> and the meaning of the dance is that both people are having a good time while it happens,</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.500" end="00:31:05.800" style="s2"> because otherwise it is not playing.</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.800" end="00:31:13.480" style="s2"> As soon as either side is not having a good time, you have exited the biological function of the game circuit.</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.480" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2"> Basically, what you tell the child by laying down those rules is:</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2"> we can physically interact within a very limited set of parameters</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:27.780" style="s2"> and what you have to learn is to be a very sophisticated player within that set of parameters</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.780" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2"> and you want to learn how to push the limits.</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:35.420" style="s2"> Because the most fun dramatic games are on the edge between assertiveness and aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:37.800" style="s2"> You can see children</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.800" end="00:31:41.620" style="s2"> I used to work in daycare when I was little, when I was eighteen / nineteen,</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.620" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2"> And the children lined up to play with me</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:49.240" style="s2"> back then it was allowed, and they were so desperate to play it was ridiculous.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.240" end="00:31:52.420" style="s2"> I could really tell the difference between the children</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.420" end="00:31:55.500" style="s2"> who had participated in that type of game and those who had not.</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.500" end="00:31:58.620" style="s2"> And the ones that weren&#39;t painfully rare</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.620" end="00:32:02.540" style="s2"> and they would hurt themselves and you when you fought with them:</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.540" end="00:32:04.060" style="s2"> they would put their thumb in your eye ..</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.060" end="00:32:08.360" style="s2"> And they would cry frequently also when they were surprised but not hurt.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.360" end="00:32:12.980" style="s2"> Because they couldn&#39;t tell the difference between just being startled and being hurt,</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.980" end="00:32:16.680" style="s2"> so they were fragile and that also made them bad playmates.</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.980" end="00:32:19.680" style="s2"> What is also so interesting about that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.680" end="00:32:22.660" style="s2"> that Piaget talked about this when he talked about the development of children,</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.660" end="00:32:27.040" style="s2"> is that the more sophisticated the dramatic game</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.040" end="00:32:32.400" style="s2"> and sophisticated cognitive game that emerges say between five and seven</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.400" end="00:32:34.460" style="s2"> and then with cognitive play, older than that,</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.460" end="00:32:40.700" style="s2"> is that unless you got that underlying psychomotor dance built in,</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.700" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2"> you don&#39;t proceed in a sophisticated way at those higher levels of play</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:47.880" style="s2"> because other people don&#39;t want to play with you.</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.520" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2"> Dramatic play, the importance of that can hardly be overrated.</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.440" style="s2"> -And the perspective here is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.440" end="00:33:01.340" style="s2"> when you build a system in which you have said that men are part of the Patriarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.340" end="00:33:08.920" style="s2"> whose desire is to dominate women and create rules that benefit them at the expense of women,</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.920" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2"> you have a perspective, an emotional situation</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2"> that is not favorable to men saying: this is what I am worth.</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:18.600" style="s2"> Or the women saying:</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.600" end="00:33:21.980" style="s2"> let me review what are the rules of being a mother and father</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.980" end="00:33:25.440" style="s2"> That lead to the best of you and the best of me.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.440" end="00:33:32.960" style="s2"> We have jumped from an inherent sense of &quot;father knows best&quot; to &quot;father doesn&#39;t know&quot; ..</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.640" end="00:33:40.100" style="s2"> The process that I will tell in a moment,</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.100" end="00:33:42.400" style="s2"> what does dramatic play lead to</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.400" end="00:33:44.820" style="s2"> And the slippery slope that exists when it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.820" end="00:33:48.940" style="s2"> is what has not even been developed</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.940" end="00:33:51.960" style="s2"> as a possibility to be articulated in this culture at this time.</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.960" end="00:33:55.560" style="s2"> -I also think that if you have a partner</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.960" end="00:33:58.040" style="s2"> who played a lot as a child,</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2"> that couple cannot tell the difference between a loud row and aggression.</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:11.300" style="s2"> And if there is a hypothesis about domination and Patriarchy as the underlying foundation</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.300" end="00:34:15.120" style="s2"> then there is going to be conceptual confusion about physical interactions</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.120" end="00:34:21.340" style="s2"> who have the appearance of submission and dominance because that is part of the routine of dramatic play.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.340" end="00:34:28.280" style="s2"> That is going to be seen through a lens of tyrannical interaction rather than just fun.</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.280" end="00:34:32.740" style="s2"> You can see the difference because if the children are playing dramatically,</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.740" end="00:34:35.800" style="s2"> they are incredibly excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.800" end="00:34:42.340" style="s2"> and participating and laughing and they will play until they drop exhausted because they need it, they need it so much.</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.340" end="00:34:46.900" style="s2"> But that is something difficult to observe from the outside if you are not used to it.</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.900" end="00:34:48.620" style="s2"> -If you don&#39;t have that perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.620" end="00:34:53.740" style="s2"> Men and fathers being of value to begin with, absolutely not.</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.740" end="00:35:02.180" style="s2"> -This is perhaps what would be helpful for a mother to understand, than dramatic play ..</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.180" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2"> Now we know how children distinguish between being assertive and aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2"> but a number of other things also happen during that game,</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2"> which is that it is a bond that is created between the father and the son and in almost every ..</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:20.340" style="s2"> Doing expert witness work to help children have both parents after divorce,</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.340" end="00:35:26.180" style="s2"> I have observed over fifty families, and usually, the father interacting with the children.</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.180" end="00:35:34.520" style="s2"> In almost every case, I think, that I have seen, this loop is used by the parent to say things like:</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.520" end="00:35:37.180" style="s2"> &quot;You don&#39;t play anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.180" end="00:35:40.780" style="s2"> Do your homework, your homework,</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.780" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2"> get ready to go to bed, brush your teeth too</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.640" end="00:35:45.840" style="s2"> and at nine it is time to go to bed.</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.840" end="00:35:50.940" style="s2"> When you have done all that you will have between then and nine</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.940" end="00:35:54.300" style="s2"> for you to have more fun with dramatic games</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.300" end="00:35:58.840" style="s2"> or reading your favorite story or whatever you prefer, it&#39;s your choice.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.840" end="00:36:00.940" style="s2"> -Panksepp, with his work,</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.940" end="00:36:09.460" style="s2"> discovered that rats would work to enter a play area because play ..</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.460" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2"> Panksepp established very clearly that there is a primary game circuit in mammals.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2"> It is a separate psychobiological circuit;</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:20.740" style="s2"> It&#39;s not exploration, it&#39;s another entirely different motivational drive.</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.820" end="00:36:25.100" style="s2"> But the activity on that circuit is inherently enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.100" end="00:36:30.380" style="s2"> and part of that seems to be because it&#39;s so important to proper socialization</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.380" end="00:36:36.480" style="s2"> which is prized by children and social mammals as inherently valuable.</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2"> It makes perfect sense that that could be used as a primary reward source,</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:47.400" style="s2"> and I think your comments about the man and the boys bonding through play</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.400" end="00:36:51.160" style="s2"> It is also very important because one of the things I do with young men that ...</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.160" end="00:36:54.020" style="s2"> I think young men tend to be partially alienated</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.020" end="00:36:56.840" style="s2"> since they are nine month old babies</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.840" end="00:37:00.600" style="s2"> because they are not really equipped to know what to do with them.</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.600" end="00:37:06.380" style="s2"> They can learn and they can be proficient at it but it is not their natural mastery of mastery.</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.380" end="00:37:08.600" style="s2"> But once a child is nine months old</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.600" end="00:37:14.800" style="s2"> and begins to be able to imitate and hit and play and respond to gentle taunts,</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.800" end="00:37:17.740" style="s2"> that&#39;s the perfect time for the father to come into play,</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.740" end="00:37:20.880" style="s2"> which is a great help for a mother, by the way, who wants to have another child,</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.880" end="00:37:25.100" style="s2"> and really start building a relationship that is based on</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.100" end="00:37:29.720" style="s2"> that interesting combination of lots of fun</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.720" end="00:37:35.220" style="s2"> and the necessary interactions that are necessary as a precursor to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.220" end="00:37:41.820" style="s2"> and if you interfere with that then you prevent the father from liking his children.</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.820" end="00:37:45.500" style="s2"> Because that&#39;s how you start to like them, playing.</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.500" end="00:37:48.900" style="s2"> It is vital, it is vitally important.</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.900" end="00:37:50.920" style="s2"> -Absolutely and thank you.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.920" end="00:37:57.360" style="s2"> The additional perspective you bring is enriching.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.360" end="00:37:59.500" style="s2"> -There is a book called Affective Neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.500" end="00:38:02.820" style="s2"> written by Jaak Panksepp, it&#39;s on my reading list, on my website.</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.820" end="00:38:04.260" style="s2"> And I would totally recommend it.</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.260" end="00:38:09.940" style="s2"> because it describes the findings of the animal literature on the primary game circuit.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.940" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2"> I should have won a Nobel Prize</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:18.300" style="s2"> Discovering a new motivational system in the brain is a huge contribution.</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.300" end="00:38:21.600" style="s2"> The other thing he did that was so cool</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.600" end="00:38:24.760" style="s2"> and it reminded me a bit of Jean Piaget&#39;s work is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.760" end="00:38:30.460" style="s2"> solidly proposed that an ethic emerges from play</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.460" end="00:38:34.460" style="s2"> And that&#39;s why I was so interested when you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.460" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2"> interactions with the father actually increase empathy.</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.200" end="00:38:41.300" style="s2"> Because if someone has empathy for you,</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.060" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2"> that can lead to a certain type of narcissism because you are always the center of attention.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:52.340" style="s2"> You are not empathetic unless you learn that you are not more important than the next person,</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.340" end="00:38:54.840" style="s2"> particularly, the person you are playing with.</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.840" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2"> Let&#39;s continue with what the parents are doing.</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.720" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2"> In the dramatic game,</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:08.140" style="s2"> what happens is that the bond that is created by the parent allows the parent to say:</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.140" end="00:39:15.740" style="s2"> &quot;We will continue the game between eight thirty and nine if you have done everything.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.560" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2"> The child learns to postpone satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2"> by doing what he loves to do there, at that moment, which is to play,</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:31.540" style="s2"> and deal with what you have to deal with before you are rewarded with what you need.</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.840" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2"> -That&#39;s interesting, you think ...</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.600" end="00:39:42.080" style="s2"> We don&#39;t know much about the origin of the conscientious factor,</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.080" end="00:39:45.820" style="s2"> which is in part the ability to delay satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.820" end="00:39:47.940" style="s2"> And after intelligence,</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.940" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2"> is the best indicator of long-term success in life,</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.160" end="00:39:53.620" style="s2"> especially in management, administrative, algorithmic positions.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.620" end="00:39:57.100" style="s2"> It is not associated with creativity but that is a separate issue.</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.980" end="00:40:02.220" style="s2"> Your hypothesis is that the main way that men are socializing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.220" end="00:40:07.060" style="s2"> is to use work to play, as a bridge.</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.420" end="00:40:09.840" style="s2"> -That game creates a bond.</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.840" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2"> Much of the problem is when mothers frequently say:</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.760" end="00:40:17.140" style="s2"> you have to do this and that and this and that.</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.140" end="00:40:20.780" style="s2"> The mother is seen by the child as the disciplinarian,</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.780" end="00:40:23.900" style="s2"> who is always asking him or her to do things</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.900" end="00:40:27.400" style="s2"> and the seeds of rebellion start to appear, something like:</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.400" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2"> How much of myself am I going to show?</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:31.080" style="s2"> How many things my mother does will I do?</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.080" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2"> Do I want to be a mama&#39;s boy?</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.180" end="00:40:37.480" style="s2"> You feel like you are being held back by so many rules.</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2"> But with the father, or the mothers who play dramatically with their children,</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.980" style="s2"> a bond is created and you want to return to that connection.</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.980" end="00:40:49.980" style="s2"> It&#39;s like a child riding a roller coaster</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.980" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2"> where you know there is a lot of fun and a lot of security.</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:40:59.140" style="s2"> You trust the father to combine both</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.140" end="00:41:04.440" style="s2"> and you want to go back to that so you are willing to focus on doing what you need to do:</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.440" end="00:41:07.800" style="s2"> your homework, chores, brushing your teeth or whatever,</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.800" end="00:41:13.060" style="s2"> To get what you want, which is to postpone satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.060" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2"> Let us now consider the slippery slope caused by the lack of this.</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.500" end="00:41:18.720" style="s2"> -Let me add one thing to that.</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.720" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2"> What&#39;s so cool about that is that you&#39;ve also given some really smart advice for parents.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.300" end="00:41:30.780" style="s2"> Say, BF Skinner, who was the famous animal behavior analyst,</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.780" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2"> clearly demonstrated that you could train animals with rewards more effectively</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:37.700" style="s2"> than with threats or punishments.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.700" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2"> Threats and punishments are necessary,</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:45.460" style="s2"> obviously we would not have biological systems observing those emotions if they were not necessary.</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.460" end="00:41:49.980" style="s2"> But the reward is more difficult to use because you have to pay much more attention</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.980" end="00:41:53.860" style="s2"> and intervene when something good happens, so you really have to be watching.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.860" end="00:41:56.600" style="s2"> But your hypothesis is:</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.600" end="00:42:02.340" style="s2"> parents, spend time playing with your children and have whatever fun you can with them</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.340" end="00:42:07.960" style="s2"> because by forming that bond you can use it as the source of reward</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.960" end="00:42:12.140" style="s2"> that will be appreciated by the child in terms of disciplinary strategies.</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.140" end="00:42:14.600" style="s2"> It&#39;s a double win:</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.600" end="00:42:18.680" style="s2"> One, it&#39;s fun and you will like your children and have fun with them;</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.680" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2"> but the second is:</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:25.860" style="s2"> you have a very positive means of disciplining them in the best sense, encouraging and disciplining them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.860" end="00:42:29.140" style="s2"> That&#39;s a really useful practical thing.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.180" end="00:42:35.380" style="s2"> -Increase the confidence of children, as if you were playing in the limit you mentioned,</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.380" end="00:42:38.080" style="s2"> but there is dad to make sure the fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.080" end="00:42:42.460" style="s2"> it is not excessive for you, for him, for your sister and others.</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.460" end="00:42:45.280" style="s2"> That is happening at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.420" style="s2"> -True, you can see it in two ways: that is embodied trust.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.420" end="00:42:53.860" style="s2"> If you throw a small child in the air and catch it, it is a lot of fun for them.</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.860" end="00:43:00.180" style="s2"> Both being released because of the threat, but then the relief they feel because of the security that is there.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.180" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2"> It is not abstract, it is proven.</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.620" end="00:43:10.320" style="s2"> -Or parents throwing the child and then &quot;fail to catch it&quot; and the child falls on the bed.</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.320" end="00:43:15.360" style="s2"> And he has this feeling of: &quot;Nobody held me, you were going to do it but ...&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.140" end="00:43:21.560" style="s2"> -Yes, that shows that there are things that can happen that are not exactly what you predicted</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.560" end="00:43:25.620" style="s2"> but within the confines of a trusting relationship, that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.620" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2"> And then you can also imagine,</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:30.860" style="s2"> if the father is playing with more than one child at the same time,</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.860" end="00:43:34.200" style="s2"> he is also acting as a referee.</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.620" end="00:43:40.220" style="s2"> Then the children learn how to be judicious in the distribution of attention,</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.220" end="00:43:42.180" style="s2"> they learn how to play fair,</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.180" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2"> learn how everyone can have a turn</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.840" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2"> and everyone wins at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.820" end="00:43:52.000" style="s2"> -And that union is part of what it creates,</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.000" end="00:43:54.100" style="s2"> everything you just said,</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.100" end="00:43:57.340" style="s2"> it is part of what leads the child to have empathy training.</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.340" end="00:44:01.400" style="s2"> And the empathy training comes from: &quot;No, you&#39;ve been too hard on your sister there.</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.400" end="00:44:08.300" style="s2"> If you play again, you can&#39;t be that tough. And if you continue to be so harsh .. &quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.580" end="00:44:13.160" style="s2"> -Game over. True, the game stops when someone is not having a good time.</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.800" end="00:44:15.540" style="s2"> When my children were little</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.540" end="00:44:19.160" style="s2"> we had this sofa that was divided into six parts.</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.160" end="00:44:21.580" style="s2"> We could put the sofas face to face</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.580" end="00:44:27.720" style="s2"> and then we would put the rear ends around it, so it was a little fighting ring.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.720" end="00:44:31.340" style="s2"> Then he would put the children in there and they would fight to the point of exhaustion.</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.340" end="00:44:33.660" style="s2"> But one of the things I used to do was:</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.660" end="00:44:38.680" style="s2"> if one of the two was hard on the other and cried,</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:44.320" style="s2"> then I realized that the one who had made the other cry was not looking at the crying child,</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.320" end="00:44:46.040" style="s2"> they looked away and avoided him.</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.040" end="00:44:51.900" style="s2"> -He always used to say: &quot;No, no, no, look. Look and see what happened.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.900" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2"> Because that triggers that embodied empathy</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:44:56.680" style="s2"> and then you can easily have a conversation and say:</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.680" end="00:45:02.600" style="s2"> &quot;Is this how you want the game to work or do you want everyone to have a good time?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.600" end="00:45:05.140" style="s2"> And the thing is that once the child looks,</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.140" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2"> then they know, because they cannot escape that empathic identification.</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.800" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2"> -When the son does not have that,</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:14.800" style="s2"> we have all this data now,</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.800" end="00:45:21.340" style="s2"> these seventy different areas where children do much worse when their father is not involved.</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.340" end="00:45:23.400" style="s2"> Let&#39;s look at the next phase of that.</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.400" end="00:45:27.480" style="s2"> When that father doesn&#39;t play dramatically,</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.480" end="00:45:29.380" style="s2"> as an example of many,</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.380" end="00:45:32.880" style="s2"> and is not imposing limits,</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.880" end="00:45:37.320" style="s2"> the child does not learn to postpone satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.320" end="00:45:38.980" style="s2"> We have solid data on this,</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.980" end="00:45:42.420" style="s2"> that children raised predominantly by parents</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.420" end="00:45:45.240" style="s2"> they have only a fifteen percent chance of having ADHD.</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.240" end="00:45:46.840" style="s2"> Children raised predominantly by mothers</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.840" end="00:45:49.240" style="s2"> they have a thirty percent chance of having ADHD.</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.240" end="00:45:51.200" style="s2"> If we look at what we just talked about,</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.200" end="00:45:53.380" style="s2"> children raised by parents</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.380" end="00:45:56.620" style="s2"> they are learning that they have to postpone that satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.620" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2"> to get the reward they want.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:02.980" style="s2"> Bring that ability to postpone satisfaction to school:</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.980" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2"> the child who does not know how to postpone the satisfaction to which they assign homework,</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:15.900" style="s2"> is frequently distracted by an incoming message, by the opportunity to play video games,</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.900" end="00:46:18.940" style="s2"> for wanting to exchange notes with other children,</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.940" end="00:46:20.360" style="s2"> distracted, distracted, distracted ...</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.360" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2"> -What has the distraction is that it does not require explaining ADHD.</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:30.760" style="s2"> The need is to explain why not all boys and girls have it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.760" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2"> And the answer is the answer you just described, is that some boys and girls ..</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:39.160" style="s2"> Distraction does not require an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.160" end="00:46:42.420" style="s2"> because people are distracted by what they reward immediately.</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.420" end="00:46:47.220" style="s2"> It is like addiction; in fact, addiction doesn&#39;t require an explanation either.</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.220" end="00:46:50.980" style="s2"> What requires explanation is the development of resources</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.980" end="00:46:57.440" style="s2"> that allow you to endure addictive pressures in the face of the fact that they are everywhere and powerful.</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.440" end="00:47:02.360" style="s2"> It is the development of control that is really the interesting problem.</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.360" end="00:47:09.080" style="s2"> I have never heard anyone connect using the game</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.080" end="00:47:11.920" style="s2"> as a reward and to postpone satisfaction,</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.920" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2"> that&#39;s a very interesting idea. It is very interesting.</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.300" end="00:47:17.640" style="s2"> -Let me take it a step further.</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.640" end="00:47:22.460" style="s2"> When postponing satisfaction is happening, or not happening,</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.460" end="00:47:25.120" style="s2"> and then the child is not able to finish homework,</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.120" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2"> You start to feel ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:35.880" style="s2"> Or if he is athletic, and his parents believe that it will be of great help if the girl or boy has big dreams:</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.880" end="00:47:37.520" style="s2"> &quot;Do you want to play in the NBA?</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.520" end="00:47:43.640" style="s2"> You are tall and if you keep practicing you can play in the NBA, you can fulfill your dreams. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.640" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2"> But if you don&#39;t postpone satisfaction,</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:51.260" style="s2"> not able to do the boring repetitions that are necessary for any success,</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.260" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2"> Including being an Olympic star or playing in the NBA or whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:59.080" style="s2"> -Or play the piano or learn to read or ..</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.080" end="00:48:00.940" style="s2"> -Great example, certainly the violin.</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.940" end="00:48:07.140" style="s2"> Whatever your dream is, the bigger the dream, the bigger the disappointment.</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.140" end="00:48:11.540" style="s2"> He&#39;s not just afraid of the disappointment he thinks his parents will feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.540" end="00:48:16.320" style="s2"> but also the feeling that you can do something at school,</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.320" end="00:48:25.560" style="s2"> his teachers, his classmates are not respecting him much; the cheerleaders pass him,</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.560" end="00:48:31.140" style="s2"> (unintelligible).</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.140" end="00:48:34.260" style="s2"> The boy is starting to feel ashamed.</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:38.460" style="s2"> -This is the prerequisite for shame:</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.460" end="00:48:42.420" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say you&#39;re drawn to a goal</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.120" end="00:48:47.700" style="s2"> naturally, and maybe that is influenced by your parents or is influenced by your peers</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.700" end="00:48:52.560" style="s2"> but it is something that you naturally direct your attention to, it grabs you in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.260" end="00:48:56.060" style="s2"> We will assume that it is a difficult target,</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.060" end="00:49:02.260" style="s2"> So there is an ethic that emerges from that which is that if that goal is valuable and it is difficult,</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.260" end="00:49:04.680" style="s2"> then there are sacrifices that have to be made,</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.680" end="00:49:07.560" style="s2"> it is necessary to implement the action of postponing satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.560" end="00:49:10.560" style="s2"> so that you are worthy of achieving that goal.</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.140" end="00:49:14.200" style="s2"> That is part of the game if you think of it as a game.</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.200" end="00:49:20.620" style="s2"> If you find yourself unable to play within the rules of the game,</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.620" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2"> So how can you not suffer shame and hate yourself?</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:30.260" style="s2"> You have adopted an ethical perspective which is: this is worth achieving.</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.260" end="00:49:33.740" style="s2"> And if you observe in yourself the inability to achieve it,</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.740" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2"> because you are constantly distracted then you are going to feel hatred for yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.700" end="00:49:44.340" style="s2"> The way out of there, and this is something I learned from Nietzsche,</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.340" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2"> this is how terrible it contains,</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:47.980" style="s2"> because it is a path to nihilism;</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.980" end="00:49:53.980" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say that you propose four objectives in succession, which are valuable to you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.980" end="00:49:58.520" style="s2"> and then you find yourself unable to discipline yourself to achieve the objectives.</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.520" end="00:50:02.060" style="s2"> After four successive failures,</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.060" end="00:50:04.820" style="s2"> It&#39;s like what Homer Simpson said to Bart:</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.820" end="00:50:11.880" style="s2"> &quot;You tried and failed and then you tried and failed again. What have you learned?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.880" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2"> and Homer says to Bart:</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:15.620" style="s2"> &quot;The conclusion is:</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.620" end="00:50:17.180" style="s2"> never try. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.640" end="00:50:25.620" style="s2"> And if you fail a few times to achieve something important because you see that you have no discipline,</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.620" end="00:50:31.000" style="s2"> So the logical response is to stop setting goals.</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.000" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2"> -And that is exactly what happens but we have, thanks to technology,</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.920" end="00:50:41.360" style="s2"> a perfect kind of exit and that exit is to video games</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.360" end="00:50:43.540" style="s2"> where you can identify with a hero</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.540" end="00:50:47.540" style="s2"> and you can lose in the game as often as you want without anyone noticing.</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.540" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2"> According to improvements with certain mechanics,</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:58.760" style="s2"> you can play that game with certain types of people and improve your skill set in the game</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.760" end="00:51:03.240" style="s2"> but you are never able to translate that into daily life.</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.240" end="00:51:08.840" style="s2"> You start to have an addiction to that game</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.840" end="00:51:14.920" style="s2"> that are designed to increase your amount of dopamine without having to get anything.</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.920" end="00:51:18.680" style="s2"> -What video games have that is different ..</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.680" end="00:51:24.080" style="s2"> A game for a young child has to pay off immediately.</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.700" end="00:51:28.940" style="s2"> That is why dramatic play works, for example it has to pay off immediately.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.940" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2"> The game resembles real life but as long as it resembles,</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:35.720" style="s2"> what happens is that the rewards are postponed,</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.720" end="00:51:39.560" style="s2"> and you become more and more disciplined in not being rewarded immediately,</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.560" end="00:51:43.220" style="s2"> like when you are learning to read or play the piano, for the long term goal.</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.220" end="00:51:47.800" style="s2"> What video games have is that they require skill development.</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.880" end="00:51:53.500" style="s2"> But the immediate reward accompanies the deferred reward.</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.500" end="00:51:56.700" style="s2"> Because otherwise the game would not be fun for someone who is learning.</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.700" end="00:51:59.920" style="s2"> But the problem is that many real life games</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.920" end="00:52:02.780" style="s2"> they are not necessarily fun while you are learning them.</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.780" end="00:52:06.600" style="s2"> Because you have to achieve a certain level of mastery and that requires discipline.</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.600" end="00:52:08.840" style="s2"> That is what is wrong with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.840" end="00:52:13.740" style="s2"> children can simply learn according to what spontaneously catches their attention.</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.740" end="00:52:15.460" style="s2"> There is part of the truth in that because,</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.460" end="00:52:17.680" style="s2"> Why not follow the interests of a child?</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.680" end="00:52:22.020" style="s2"> But the problem is that many efforts that require great skill,</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.020" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2"> practically any effort that will be of economic or productive profit,</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:35.180" style="s2"> requires grueling learning, there is a lot of purely disciplinary repetition.</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.540" end="00:52:44.080" style="s2"> And then one more dimension of that is that according to the boy he grows up to be interested in girls,</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.080" end="00:52:47.180" style="s2"> if you start to feel that you are straight,</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.180" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2"> notices that girls are much more interested in dating quarterbacks,</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.440" style="s2"> or the student body president or the type of artist</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.440" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2"> that are valued in schools and life in general.</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:02.860" style="s2"> You start to feel isolated and feel like you can&#39;t attract those girls,</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.860" end="00:53:07.020" style="s2"> especially those who are more biologically addicted, pretty girls,</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.020" end="00:53:11.180" style="s2"> the cheerleader type, and begins to isolate himself in porn.</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.180" end="00:53:14.200" style="s2"> A little porn is not a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.200" end="00:53:24.360" style="s2"> But porn is basically based on dopamine increasing with each new stimulus.</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.360" end="00:53:27.740" style="s2"> As you latch onto that dopamine,</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.740" end="00:53:33.460" style="s2"> he begins to get hooked on only being able to be stimulated when more risks are taken.</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.460" end="00:53:37.340" style="s2"> Finally, he succeeds and gets a girl / woman</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.340" end="00:53:40.900" style="s2"> walks by her house and is sexual with her.</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.900" end="00:53:46.320" style="s2"> He is so incapable of being excited perhaps by the light touch on a hand,</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.320" end="00:53:51.460" style="s2"> or get excited by what you are saying and the interaction,</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.460" end="00:53:55.940" style="s2"> or some combination of the drama of being with her with a little touch.</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.940" end="00:54:03.500" style="s2"> He is so used to such a large amount of stimuli that occur and when he trusts her he says:</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.500" end="00:54:06.260" style="s2"> Can you be this You can do this? Can you act like this?</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.260" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2"> And she feels like she is just a piece of object that is replacing porn</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:14.520" style="s2"> and finally feels disgusted by him, walks away and he begins to say:</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.520" end="00:54:18.420" style="s2"> this convinces me that I am as useless as I thought.</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.420" end="00:54:21.740" style="s2"> And the only thing that will satisfy me is going back to porn</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.740" end="00:54:25.300" style="s2"> and what was a little addiction gets bigger</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.300" end="00:54:30.920" style="s2"> and simultaneously becomes addicted to video games at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.920" end="00:54:36.180" style="s2"> All of that is the slippery slope from the dramatic play,</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.180" end="00:54:40.680" style="s2"> that the father is not capable of articulating to the mother the value of that;</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.680" end="00:54:44.080" style="s2"> combined with the confidence you were integrating with that;</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.080" end="00:54:47.220" style="s2"> combined with the lack of link;</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.220" end="00:54:51.220" style="s2"> combined with teaching to postpone satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.220" end="00:54:54.680" style="s2"> When not taught to postpone satisfaction,</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.680" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2"> slippery slope leads to shame, self-loathing</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:02.280" style="s2"> and afraid that if you try something,</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.280" end="00:55:06.820" style="s2"> He is only going to prove to himself and everyone around him that he is one more failure.</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.820" end="00:55:10.300" style="s2"> And the degree to which you articulate the desire to try something</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.300" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2"> is the public announcement to a group of people who will say:</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:19.360" style="s2"> &quot;Today I will try this and tomorrow it will be a failure&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.360" end="00:55:22.760" style="s2"> until he&#39;s ashamed of himself.</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.760" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2"> In worst case scenarios this can lead to such depression</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.400" end="00:55:35.480" style="s2"> that creates a suicide wish and to believe what we see in school shooters.</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.480" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2"> -That creates resentment.</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:40.560" style="s2"> Absolutely, buddy, that creates resentment and anger galore.</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.560" end="00:55:43.420" style="s2"> -Who are they resentful and angry with?</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.420" end="00:55:45.140" style="s2"> Who are the people who have rejected it?</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.140" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2"> They are the classmates, they are the teachers; no one appreciates the sweet sensitivity inside him.</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:56.580" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;m so mad at that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.580" end="00:56:01.480" style="s2"> And someday I&#39;ll have the desperate need to get their attention and say:</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.480" end="00:56:04.400" style="s2"> I count, I matter, pay attention to me. &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.400" end="00:56:08.700" style="s2"> In the worst cases, only a small percentage,</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.700" end="00:56:13.380" style="s2"> You can understand how the school shootings emerged from there.</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.380" end="00:56:20.860" style="s2"> -For every boy who goes to shoot in a school there are a thousand who fantasize in that direction.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.860" end="00:56:25.180" style="s2"> At first it is something like:</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.180" end="00:56:28.360" style="s2"> &quot;I am angry with people because they do not see the value in me&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.360" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2"> But if they get to the point where they fantasize with extreme violence,</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:36.980" style="s2"> They&#39;ve been through it for so long that they&#39;ve developed a real hatred for everything.</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.980" end="00:56:39.400" style="s2"> And a desire to see it shattered.</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.400" end="00:56:45.880" style="s2"> That is the most terrible of the possible results that can be generated.</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.880" end="00:56:51.540" style="s2"> You&#39;ve talked about dramatic play and postponing satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.540" end="00:56:53.760" style="s2"> you&#39;ve added empathy.</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.760" end="00:56:58.380" style="s2"> Are there other cardinal things you are seeing parents do?</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.380" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2"> That&#39;s pretty early in life</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:08.180" style="s2"> you are looking at interaction with children between one year and seven years old, something like that?</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.180" end="00:57:15.180" style="s2"> What else do you see happening with parents, both in the early stages and also later?</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.180" end="00:57:19.000" style="s2"> -Another important thing is the concept of spending time together.</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.000" end="00:57:22.220" style="s2"> For a mother who is listening to this who has a daughter,</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.220" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2"> we now know that daughters who have a significant amount of time to hang out with their parents,</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:35.440" style="s2"> that creates more psychological stability than any other phenomenon.</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.440" end="00:57:38.020" style="s2"> With the boys it is also very important.</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.020" end="00:57:41.700" style="s2"> For example, let&#39;s say you are in a divorce situation.</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.700" end="00:57:47.620" style="s2"> and a father is with the son for a short period of time, on Saturday,</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.620" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2"> and picks up his son from a soccer game.</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:56.140" style="s2"> And he says to Josh: &quot;How was the game?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.140" end="00:57:59.420" style="s2"> and a boy especially is more likely to say:</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.420" end="00:58:01.800" style="s2"> &quot;Good, it was good.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.800" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2"> &quot;Tell me more, Josh.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:05.760" style="s2"> &quot;It was just okay, dad.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.760" end="00:58:09.320" style="s2"> So if at that time,</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.320" end="00:58:15.400" style="s2"> the father has to leave the child at the mother&#39;s house because visiting time is over,</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.400" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2"> there is nothing that happens beyond that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:24.200" style="s2"> -And the child will be there, children in particular, although it also happens with couples,</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.200" end="00:58:30.100" style="s2"> is that one of the things you would do to the person you are with</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.100" end="00:58:32.240" style="s2"> to check if they care</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.240" end="00:58:39.600" style="s2"> is withholding some information that might be relevant to see to what degree they care.</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.600" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2"> Because if you ask me if I have done something, how was it,</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:46.860" style="s2"> one of the things I&#39;m going to want to know is:</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.860" end="00:58:48.120" style="s2"> Do you really care</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.120" end="00:58:51.140" style="s2"> And if you&#39;re my father, I&#39;m really going to want to know that.</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.140" end="00:58:55.220" style="s2"> One of the ways that I can measure that is by asking you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.220" end="00:59:03.800" style="s2"> but that assumes that your answer is going to be a reflection of your current self and there is no reason to assume that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.800" end="00:59:07.400" style="s2"> A better way to do it is for me to be a little quiet</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.400" end="00:59:11.820" style="s2"> and a little resistant because then I can see, are you going to insist a little?</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.820" end="00:59:14.780" style="s2"> Cause that&#39;s a fun thing to do if you&#39;re a bit of a joker</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.780" end="00:59:18.720" style="s2"> you can tap him on the chest a few times and say:</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.720" end="00:59:20.500" style="s2"> &quot;Kid, let go and talk to me.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.500" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2"> And normally if you do that with a boy, even a teenager,</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:31.880" style="s2"> They will laugh and put your hand away and say &quot;Go away, Daddy&quot; but are glad to have that extra insistence.</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.880" end="00:59:36.980" style="s2"> Take them out of their shell and it&#39;s a demonstration that the boy does, in fact, care.</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.980" end="00:59:38.860" style="s2"> And you need time for that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.920" end="00:59:44.780" style="s2"> That boy, if he did well, or she did well,</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.780" end="00:59:47.480" style="s2"> is very happy to say:</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.480" end="00:59:51.300" style="s2"> &quot;I scored three goals today, that is much more than they have scored in the history of our school.</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.300" end="00:59:52.520" style="s2"> Isn&#39;t it amazing? &quot;</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.520" end="00:59:54.980" style="s2"> No problem, they will share that directly.</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.980" end="01:00:02.280" style="s2"> But the reason to hesitate to say something that embarrasses them,</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.280" end="01:00:08.080" style="s2"> I remember a father saying that his son came home and had been the doorman the week before.</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.080" end="01:00:13.100" style="s2"> But the following week he had not been chosen to be a goalkeeper and he could not understand why.</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.100" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2"> So he hesitates to say anything to his father because he doesn&#39;t want the father to lecture him;</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:23.020" style="s2"> or think you are a failure; or to be disappointed;</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.020" end="01:00:25.380" style="s2"> or have that feeling of:</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.380" end="01:00:28.780" style="s2"> &quot;This is not my son, I want my son to score the goals.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.780" end="01:00:38.000" style="s2"> With all these fears, especially the child in terms of performance, any failure will be silenced.</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.000" end="01:00:43.560" style="s2"> If the father leaves the child at the mother&#39;s house, that is never fixed.</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.560" end="01:00:46.500" style="s2"> If the father has time to spend with the children,</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:48.560" style="s2"> say, doing homework together,</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.560" end="01:00:51.540" style="s2"> the father is watching TV and the child is doing homework</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.540" end="01:00:55.600" style="s2"> and then they go at the same time to take something out of the fridge,</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.600" end="01:00:58.540" style="s2"> and they have a discussion about what he wants for dinner</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.540" end="01:01:01.120" style="s2"> and the father asks for help to make dinner,</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.120" end="01:01:03.780" style="s2"> instead of the child sitting around and having no responsibility,</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.780" end="01:01:05.000" style="s2"> something parents tend to do.</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.000" end="01:01:10.060" style="s2"> They ask the children to help prepare dinner, not just serve it.</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.060" end="01:01:17.100" style="s2"> In that process of the child cutting things off and doing that kind of boring thing, the child will tend to say:</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.100" end="01:01:22.120" style="s2"> &quot;I was a goalkeeper last week but not this week. What&#39;s up with that?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.120" end="01:01:27.840" style="s2"> And the child may say that to his mother, even faster,</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.840" end="01:01:34.180" style="s2"> but the expectations of the child with the mother is that the mother will secure the child and tell him:</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.180" end="01:01:38.660" style="s2"> &quot;It&#39;s okay, you&#39;re fine, you&#39;re wonderful, you&#39;re a great goalkeeper.</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.660" end="01:01:44.080" style="s2"> Maybe the coach wanted to give the other kids a chance because you&#39;re so good, etc. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.080" end="01:01:48.100" style="s2"> While you can expect a little more confrontation from parents, more questions.</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:53.960" style="s2"> -One of the things I have observed when talking to my clinical clients about their intimate relationships is:</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.960" end="01:01:56.580" style="s2"> I&#39;ve been trying to measure simple rules</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.580" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2"> for the minimum interaction time necessary to maintain a relationship.</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.400" end="01:02:02.120" style="s2"> With couples I have observed that</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.120" end="01:02:08.920" style="s2"> they need at least one or two sessions of intimate time together a week, something like that,</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.920" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2"> or things start to fall apart but they also need, as far as I understand,</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:18.620" style="s2"> about ninety minutes of communication time in a week</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.620" end="01:02:22.760" style="s2"> just to keep the other updated in relation to their stories.</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.420" end="01:02:30.700" style="s2"> Two questions, one is: do you have any idea how you would characterize spending time together?</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.700" end="01:02:37.660" style="s2"> And how much does it have to be in order not to go down to a dangerous minimum?</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.660" end="01:02:40.100" style="s2"> And the other thing that I would like that I would like to develop is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.100" end="01:02:47.920" style="s2"> that you&#39;ve talked a bit about the most combative approach a parent can take</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.920" end="01:02:54.420" style="s2"> when he discusses a fault or a defect, or something like that, on the part of the child.</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.420" end="01:02:58.180" style="s2"> I want to share something that I have learned by talking to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.660" end="01:03:02.800" style="s2"> mostly male audiences in the last year and a half, two years,</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.800" end="01:03:05.600" style="s2"> about responsibility and discipline and all that.</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.840" end="01:03:11.040" style="s2"> You may think that telling someone your faults is harsh and critical.</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.640" end="01:03:17.700" style="s2"> And it is, in a sense, but it&#39;s not harsh and critical about its potential.</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.380" end="01:03:23.080" style="s2"> If your son comes and says: &quot;I screwed up and this is what I did that didn&#39;t go so well&quot;,</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.080" end="01:03:25.700" style="s2"> And you say, &quot;That&#39;s fine, you&#39;re a wonderful boy&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.700" end="01:03:31.480" style="s2"> so the kid is stuck in trouble because they don&#39;t feel so wonderful, and they&#39;ve failed.</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.480" end="01:03:35.900" style="s2"> But if you say, &quot;That was stupid. What&#39;s your problem?</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.900" end="01:03:37.680" style="s2"> This is what you could do.</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.680" end="01:03:39.820" style="s2"> You can do better than this, put your life in order.</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.820" end="01:03:46.060" style="s2"> Let&#39;s think of some strategies so you can think about how that is not going to happen to you again. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.060" end="01:03:49.900" style="s2"> Instead of putting your faith in who the kid is right now,</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.900" end="01:03:54.920" style="s2"> which I would say is in some sense the brand of impulsive empathy,</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.920" end="01:03:59.020" style="s2"> you put your faith in who the kid could be and that&#39;s cheering.</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.020" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2"> And I would say that in failure circumstances,</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:04.940" style="s2"> especially where the child is motivated to try again,</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.940" end="01:04:11.260" style="s2"> giving the child courage overcomes impulsive empathy without looking at the cards</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.260" end="01:04:14.260" style="s2"> as an indicator of faith in who the child might be.</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.860" end="01:04:25.120" style="s2"> -It takes time for the child to reveal his vulnerability and also to have a faith that the father ..</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.800" end="01:04:34.820" style="s2"> The child tends to open like a flower when she or he realizes that</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.820" end="01:04:40.640" style="s2"> the security that the father is creating by being with them and talking about that problem is there.</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:47.240" style="s2"> In an ideal situation, a wise parent will not immediately provide a solution.</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.240" end="01:04:49.980" style="s2"> They will ask the child something like:</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.980" end="01:04:55.580" style="s2"> &quot;What do you think happened in terms of last week in contrast to this?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.580" end="01:04:59.760" style="s2"> What do you think the coach&#39;s intentions were?</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.760" end="01:05:03.640" style="s2"> Often within the child</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.640" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2"> there is an idea of ​​what probably happened but a fear of acknowledging it,</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:18.620" style="s2"> and especially, recognize him in front of anyone because they will not have respect for him.</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.620" end="01:05:22.520" style="s2"> Being able to have time to be together</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.520" end="01:05:33.320" style="s2"> it allows enough time to feel those long arms of security and affection surrounding him or her.</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.320" end="01:05:39.760" style="s2"> The fact that the father is not going to give up in time will be there for the child.</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.760" end="01:05:46.620" style="s2"> Then when the parent facilitates the exploration within themselves</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.620" end="01:05:53.000" style="s2"> about what the problem could be, helping him in a rogerian way (Carl Rogers)</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.000" end="01:05:57.300" style="s2"> to find the part of him that knows the answer.</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.300" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2"> Then the boy is experiencing both the respect and the willingness to confront:</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:10.220" style="s2"> &quot;If I don&#39;t have the answer inside of me, my father will tell me the truth about what I need to do now.</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.220" end="01:06:14.540" style="s2"> And by telling me the truth about what I need to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.540" end="01:06:18.780" style="s2"> It is his way of respecting me without saying that he is respecting me</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.780" end="01:06:22.340" style="s2"> because he wouldn&#39;t be telling me the truth if he didn&#39;t respect me.</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.340" end="01:06:27.220" style="s2"> -Not me specifically,</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.220" end="01:06:32.520" style="s2"> If I didn&#39;t respect my intrinsic ability to overcome obstacles and grow.</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.520" end="01:06:35.320" style="s2"> Which is the best answer for someone who says:</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.320" end="01:06:39.700" style="s2"> &quot;I have a problem&quot; is: &quot;I have faith that you can overcome it.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.700" end="01:06:43.320" style="s2"> Not that you don&#39;t have a problem or that you&#39;re fine the way you are.</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.900" end="01:06:50.300" style="s2"> There&#39;s another thing that you talk about that agrees with,</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.300" end="01:06:54.620" style="s2"> I&#39;d say standard but relatively profound clinical wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.620" end="01:06:55.700" style="s2"> what is what</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.500" end="01:07:02.600" style="s2"> people are much more likely to follow a set of injunctions if they generate them themselves.</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.140" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2"> We have had some really interesting experiences with the program we designed called</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:12.300" style="s2"> Future Authoring Program, and helps people design a life plan.</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.300" end="01:07:18.300" style="s2"> They have to develop a vision for their operations the six or seven basic dimensions of life</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.300" end="01:07:20.620" style="s2"> like intimate relationships and family</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.620" end="01:07:22.340" style="s2"> and career and education ambitions</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.340" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2"> and resistance to temptation, drugs and alcohol;</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:27.580" style="s2"> take care of yourself physically and mentally and so on,</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.580" end="01:07:29.280" style="s2"> those fundamental dimensions;</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.280" end="01:07:32.100" style="s2"> productive use of time away from work.</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.520" end="01:07:35.920" style="s2"> To ask themselves what they want to have</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.920" end="01:07:38.080" style="s2"> if they could have what they wanted and needed</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.080" end="01:07:40.440" style="s2"> according to those domains, three to five years forward;</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.440" end="01:07:46.220" style="s2"> develop a vision based on that set of wills and desires,</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.220" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2"> and also write an opposite view.</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:52.740" style="s2"> Which is: where could you be if you allow yourself to fail catastrophically?</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.740" end="01:07:54.900" style="s2"> What would that look like in three or five years?</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.900" end="01:07:59.140" style="s2"> And then produce a plan and it has had impressive effects,</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.140" end="01:08:03.840" style="s2"> young men fare worse than young women in academic settings.</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.840" end="01:08:09.380" style="s2"> The program does not seem to have as much of an effect on young women but that could be because they are doing better now,</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.380" end="01:08:12.320" style="s2"> but it has an impressive effect on young men.</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.320" end="01:08:17.500" style="s2"> In fact, in a trades house environment, the latest data we have,</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.500" end="01:08:20.420" style="s2"> that were published last year,</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.420" end="01:08:22.900" style="s2"> shows that we can reduce the number of men who drop out of college,</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.900" end="01:08:25.580" style="s2"> especially aimless men who haven&#39;t done very well in high school.</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.580" end="01:08:28.440" style="s2"> We can reduce your churn rate by fifty percent.</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.800" end="01:08:32.600" style="s2"> One of the things that I have observed about young men,</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.600" end="01:08:36.740" style="s2"> and this may be because they are less personable in confrontations than young women,</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.740" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2"> is that unless they have formulated their own plan,</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:43.060" style="s2"> they are unlikely to do anything.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.060" end="01:08:49.200" style="s2"> I think it&#39;s also true with women too, you want to talk to them and tell them:</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.200" end="01:08:52.140" style="s2"> &quot;What do you think about what happened and how are you going to get out of there?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.140" end="01:08:53.680" style="s2"> What is an excellent question</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.680" end="01:08:57.760" style="s2"> because it tells the child: you can think about what happened and be precise,</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.760" end="01:09:00.100" style="s2"> and you can think of a way out of the problem.</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.100" end="01:09:03.600" style="s2"> That&#39;s cheering and that&#39;s what you want</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.600" end="01:09:05.820" style="s2"> you don&#39;t want to protect or shelter your child,</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.820" end="01:09:07.380" style="s2"> you want to cheer him up.</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.760" end="01:09:11.280" style="s2"> That collaborative problem solving is a great way to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.340" end="01:09:15.880" style="s2"> -I&#39;ve been watching this over and over again,</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.880" end="01:09:20.600" style="s2"> And certainly the data I&#39;ve obtained for The Boys&#39; Crisis shows that too.</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.600" end="01:09:23.640" style="s2"> Spending time together is part of what helps to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.640" end="01:09:28.340" style="s2"> but also the regulations that parenting offers,</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.340" end="01:09:34.400" style="s2"> It is vital that mothers and fathers understand them according to what you were saying.</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.400" end="01:09:43.780" style="s2"> Mother and father, the boy comes home from school, and the boy says:</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.780" end="01:09:49.520" style="s2"> &quot;Mrs. Myers hates me, I&#39;m not doing well at school.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.520" end="01:09:58.280" style="s2"> And maybe the boy is in second or third and the mother&#39;s reaction will tend to be something like, &quot;Tell me more.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.280" end="01:10:02.520" style="s2"> The mother will tend to solve it by saying:</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.520" end="01:10:05.780" style="s2"> The mother will tend to solve it by saying:</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.780" end="01:10:07.940" style="s2"> &quot;Wait until next week.</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.940" end="01:10:15.700" style="s2"> I&#39;m going to talk to the principal on Monday and we&#39;ll talk about changing your class to a different one from Mrs. Myers. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.700" end="01:10:19.460" style="s2"> Parents will tend to say to a greater degree:</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.460" end="01:10:24.040" style="s2"> &quot;In life you have to learn to get along with people who don&#39;t like you.</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.040" end="01:10:28.340" style="s2"> What do you think Mrs. Myers is upset about you? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.340" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2"> And the boy may respond, the father will say:</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:36.700" style="s2"> &quot;-Do you want me to talk to Mrs. Myers about this? -No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.700" end="01:10:41.560" style="s2"> -If I talk to Mrs. Myers about it, what do you think Mrs. Myers will say? &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.560" end="01:10:46.580" style="s2"> And then the child, under the possible threat of the father or mother talking to Mrs. Myers,</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.580" end="01:10:49.660" style="s2"> will start to tell how Mrs. Myers feels</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.660" end="01:10:55.880" style="s2"> and then they will negotiate an opportunity to speak with Mrs. Myers</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.880" end="01:10:59.740" style="s2"> and get the boy and Mrs. Myers together, have a discussion together,</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.740" end="01:11:03.900" style="s2"> to see if the boy and Mrs. Myers can develop an understanding</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.900" end="01:11:09.780" style="s2"> in which the child begins to understand that it is not that Mrs. Myers naturally hates Jimmy,</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.780" end="01:11:13.120" style="s2"> is that something else is happening.</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.120" end="01:11:15.900" style="s2"> The result of working all that</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.900" end="01:11:23.640" style="s2"> It is a way of making it easier for the child to discover their own solutions to a problem,</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.640" end="01:11:29.700" style="s2"> speaking it instead of receiving a solution, instead of having received the capacity by the system</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.700" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2"> and for their parents, who will end up disappearing from the child&#39;s life,</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.000" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2"> or worse, they will not disappear from the child&#39;s life.</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.940" end="01:11:45.980" style="s2"> Often the mother says:</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.980" end="01:11:48.600" style="s2"> &quot;The boy has a problem.</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.600" end="01:11:50.900" style="s2"> Why are you being so insensitive?</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.900" end="01:11:55.720" style="s2"> Are you blaming Jimmy for creating this problem?</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.720" end="01:12:03.340" style="s2"> He tells you that not only does Mrs. Myers hate him, but other kids hate Mrs. Myers too.</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.340" end="01:12:06.280" style="s2"> So it&#39;s not Jimmy&#39;s fault. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.280" end="01:12:08.700" style="s2"> The mother will feel that the father is being insensitive</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.700" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2"> when, in fact, the parent is being sensitive in another way.</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:16.800" style="s2"> Sensitive about postponing long-term satisfaction.</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.800" end="01:12:20.640" style="s2"> -That&#39;s it, and that&#39;s a cold virtue.</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.640" end="01:12:25.600" style="s2"> Sounds a lot like it&#39;s based</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.600" end="01:12:30.640" style="s2"> at least in part, in these psychobiological differences between men and women.</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:33.740" style="s2"> Women have more negative emotion and are more empathetic,</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.740" end="01:12:35.580" style="s2"> And that&#39;s short-term empathy.</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.580" end="01:12:39.220" style="s2"> That is perfectly in accordance with the approximation you just described.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.220" end="01:12:46.040" style="s2"> This is a particularly advantageous approach to very very young children, especially infants.</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.040" end="01:12:50.440" style="s2"> Because being properly built to take care of babies.</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.440" end="01:12:55.220" style="s2"> The baby is always right, up to nine months of age or perhaps a year.</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.220" end="01:13:00.000" style="s2"> The correct answer to your baby if that person is crying is:</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.000" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2"> there is something you should do as fast as possible.</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.360" end="01:13:06.420" style="s2"> We have talked a bit about what parents can do</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.420" end="01:13:11.300" style="s2"> to help your children learn to delay satisfaction and so on.</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.300" end="01:13:17.620" style="s2"> We have talked a bit about what mothers can understand about how they can facilitate it and how to trust.</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.280" end="01:13:21.360" style="s2"> Maybe we could talk a bit about what families could do</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.360" end="01:13:27.360" style="s2"> to improve the efficiency of your boys and girls.</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.360" end="01:13:31.460" style="s2"> You&#39;ve talked a bit in your book about family dinner nights and their importance.</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:39.300" style="s2"> -We already know that family dinner nights are important</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.300" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2"> but what makes family dinner nights even more valuable</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:46.260" style="s2"> It&#39;s when they don&#39;t turn into family dinner nightmares.</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.260" end="01:13:50.060" style="s2"> And know how to structure them so they don&#39;t turn into family dinner nightmares.</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:53.480" style="s2"> When someone comes to me after a presentation and says:</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.480" end="01:13:58.060" style="s2"> &quot;I can&#39;t get my children to put down their cell phones during dinner&quot;,</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.060" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2"> I already know the beginning of the problem,</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:02.500" style="s2"> which is that the children are in charge of the parents.</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.700" end="01:14:12.260" style="s2"> &quot;What can I do to encourage my children to participate, to put down their mobiles?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.260" end="01:14:15.380" style="s2"> The number one answer is to require them to do so,</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.380" end="01:14:17.740" style="s2"> Sitting during dinner is not an option.</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.740" end="01:14:20.000" style="s2"> Some nights you will, some you will not.</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.000" end="01:14:22.580" style="s2"> But if you&#39;re having a family dinner night,</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.580" end="01:14:24.920" style="s2"> especially a structured family dinner night,</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.920" end="01:14:27.880" style="s2"> Rule number one is no gadgets at dinner.</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.880" end="01:14:30.220" style="s2"> If that rule is violated,</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.220" end="01:14:36.520" style="s2"> then the appliances are immediately put away for a reasonable period of time</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.520" end="01:14:38.140" style="s2"> once the rule is understood.</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.140" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2"> -You can imagine that catalyzing wars in various households.</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.420" end="01:14:48.260" style="s2"> -Then you start to structure those family dinner nights so that</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.260" end="01:14:50.980" style="s2"> everyone have a chance to speak.</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.980" end="01:14:55.040" style="s2"> Everyone has a structured amount of time at the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.040" end="01:15:00.720" style="s2"> in which they can tell how their week was or how the week has gone since the last time.</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.720" end="01:15:06.300" style="s2"> Everybody knows it&#39;s not forty minutes for the rest and one for me,</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.300" end="01:15:11.200" style="s2"> That would make the interest of a family dinner night zero to the one with a minute.</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.700" end="01:15:16.840" style="s2"> -That is an extension of the idea of ​​a fair game as well and a mediated fair game.</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.840" end="01:15:20.460" style="s2"> -The idea that as a family,</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.460" end="01:15:24.500" style="s2"> our job is to make sure everyone&#39;s needs are being managed,</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.500" end="01:15:27.940" style="s2"> They are taken into account and cared for, which is how empathy is created.</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.940" end="01:15:33.520" style="s2"> Empathy is not created by a parent who is always empathetic to the child&#39;s needs or wants.</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.520" end="01:15:36.380" style="s2"> When a parent is always empathetic to needs and wants,</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.380" end="01:15:39.700" style="s2"> the child becomes narcissistic, not empathetic.</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.700" end="01:15:42.260" style="s2"> That is one of the things we have been wrong about.</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.260" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2"> -You can repeat it three or four times and that would be very good.</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.160" end="01:15:50.980" style="s2"> Because that&#39;s so crucially important because</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.980" end="01:15:55.940" style="s2"> if what you are learning is to put the feelings of other people</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.940" end="01:15:58.800" style="s2"> at the same level of importance as yours,</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.800" end="01:16:03.160" style="s2"> so obviously that&#39;s associated very closely with postponing satisfaction,</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.160" end="01:16:05.720" style="s2"> with learning to listen, with taking turns,</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.720" end="01:16:10.300" style="s2"> fair play, mediated interaction, all that.</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.300" end="01:16:16.520" style="s2"> So the other thing that also happens, and you see it with couples, is if they spend that time together.</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.520" end="01:16:19.060" style="s2"> Something analogous to family dinner night,</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.060" end="01:16:23.740" style="s2"> although I think the idea of ​​the family dinner is very good for reasons that I will mention in a moment.</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.500" end="01:16:27.740" style="s2"> Imagine that your family has a story.</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.740" end="01:16:32.680" style="s2"> And the story is where we come from, where we are, where we are going together as a unit.</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.680" end="01:16:37.780" style="s2"> And then each individual within that story has a story</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.780" end="01:16:40.620" style="s2"> And then what you do on those family dinner nights</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.620" end="01:16:46.800" style="s2"> that time of interaction, is that you are picking up the individual threads of the story</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.800" end="01:16:49.860" style="s2"> and you intertwine them to make collective history,</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.860" end="01:16:54.460" style="s2"> and that keeps everyone updated and on the same page</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.460" end="01:16:59.700" style="s2"> and able to empathize in a deep way because if I don&#39;t know where you are or what your intentions are,</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.700" end="01:17:02.600" style="s2"> I can&#39;t know what you think or feel.</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.600" end="01:17:06.140" style="s2"> I have to know what story you are presenting now and so do you.</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.140" end="01:17:08.200" style="s2"> So that you know it and I know it,</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.200" end="01:17:12.360" style="s2"> you have to be able to tell your story and I have to be able to ask you about it.</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.360" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2"> Then I think the other thing that is very important about potluck</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:20.840" style="s2"> is that human beings are very rare creatures because we really share food.</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.840" end="01:17:24.120" style="s2"> And we are social diners - people don&#39;t eat well if they eat on their own.</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.120" end="01:17:28.460" style="s2"> So the idea of ​​sharing food is deeply ingrained in us.</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.460" end="01:17:32.260" style="s2"> so part of the extended socialization process is</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.260" end="01:17:35.260" style="s2"> gather everyone and sit around the food;</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.260" end="01:17:38.320" style="s2"> be polite and grateful for the fact that you are food;</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.320" end="01:17:44.300" style="s2"> enjoy that but also be able to give and receive while sharing food and that is,</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.300" end="01:17:48.180" style="s2"> I would say, if the most fundamental element of socialization</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.180" end="01:17:51.040" style="s2"> is something like the embodiment of dramatic play,</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.040" end="01:17:54.420" style="s2"> the next layer on top would be the ability to sit</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.420" end="01:17:58.500" style="s2"> and share food and have a civilized speech.</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.500" end="01:18:03.040" style="s2"> -And a civilized speech really needs ..</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.040" end="01:18:06.120" style="s2"> Respect for history is so crucial.</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.120" end="01:18:11.180" style="s2"> I teach, as you know, communication courses for couples around the country.</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.180" end="01:18:17.440" style="s2"> And one of the dimensions that seems the most important thing that destroys marriages,</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.440" end="01:18:21.820" style="s2"> or almost all relationships, is, like a biological propensity,</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.820" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2"> the lack of ability to handle personal criticism without being defensive.</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:28.220" style="s2"> My main task is to teach couples</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.220" end="01:18:33.340" style="s2"> how to avoid that biological propensity to be defensive when they hear criticism.</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.340" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2"> One of the many steps in that process,</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:37.180" style="s2"> that&#39;s too long to describe now,</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.180" end="01:18:43.360" style="s2"> but it is to give you an image of a person, Mario Cuomo,</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.360" end="01:18:44.980" style="s2"> the former governor of New York,</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.980" end="01:18:52.300" style="s2"> an image made by four artists who created an image on the same site, in the same place.</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.300" end="01:18:57.880" style="s2"> And there are four different types of artists who created this image of him,</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.880" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2"> like Andy Warhol, Modigliani and others.</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:06.820" style="s2"> I work with each couple to understand that when you listen to your partner&#39;s story,</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.820" end="01:19:09.860" style="s2"> even if you are looking at the same thing,</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.860" end="01:19:15.120" style="s2"> there will be a different image that is being created by each person at the table.</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.120" end="01:19:20.820" style="s2"> So each couple&#39;s job is to understand how much each would sacrifice.</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.820" end="01:19:26.500" style="s2"> so that the other person lives and how often we are not able to handle personal criticism</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.500" end="01:19:30.620" style="s2"> and reorient ourselves before we handle personal criticism</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.620" end="01:19:35.560" style="s2"> to go to a place where you are truly fascinated by your partner&#39;s story.</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.560" end="01:19:42.400" style="s2"> but at the family dinner table that has to happen with every member of the family</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.400" end="01:19:46.900" style="s2"> that when person A says:</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.900" end="01:19:49.720" style="s2"> &quot;What were you talking about at school?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.720" end="01:19:52.920" style="s2"> and someone says, &quot;We are talking about the #MeToo movement&quot;,</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.920" end="01:19:56.300" style="s2"> and person A says: &quot;The #MeToo movement is stupid&quot;,</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.300" end="01:19:57.460" style="s2"> so person B responds:</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.460" end="01:20:00.460" style="s2"> &quot;The #MeToo movement is the best progressive thing that ever happened&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.460" end="01:20:07.420" style="s2"> so it is very important that the person who says it is the best thing that ever happened</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.420" end="01:20:12.860" style="s2"> be heard completely by the person who thinks they are stupid and vice versa</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.860" end="01:20:20.080" style="s2"> and that there are polite questions that the family teaches its members to ask.</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.660" end="01:20:25.640" style="s2"> -Part of that is knowing the story before criticizing it.</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.640" end="01:20:29.980" style="s2"> Carl Rogers had good advice on that</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.980" end="01:20:34.660" style="s2"> because you probably already know this, but it&#39;s worth reiterating for people who don&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.660" end="01:20:38.300" style="s2"> Rogers&#39; rule when you were listening to someone was:</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.440" end="01:20:45.020" style="s2"> don&#39;t assume either you or they know what they are talking about or what they are going to say.</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.020" end="01:20:49.960" style="s2"> Because people think through speech,</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.960" end="01:20:53.180" style="s2"> so you have to give them a chance to say it all before criticizing it</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.180" end="01:20:56.180" style="s2"> because they might change their own ideas halfway through.</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.180" end="01:21:01.620" style="s2"> That is important, let them formulate the problem before criticizing them</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.620" end="01:21:05.160" style="s2"> but the next thing is, I love it, I think it&#39;s really useful;</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.160" end="01:21:11.160" style="s2"> which is that once the person has developed their story, you have to say:</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:17.420" style="s2"> &quot;This is what I have heard you say, do you agree with my approach?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:23.600" style="s2"> Because that, first, indicates to the speaker that the listener, in fact, heard</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.600" end="01:21:26.760" style="s2"> or if there is an error the speaker can say:</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.760" end="01:21:30.180" style="s2"> &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I said at all&quot; and then there may be some clarification.</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.180" end="01:21:35.840" style="s2"> It also forces the listener not to turn the opponent into a scarecrow</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.840" end="01:21:39.560" style="s2"> because it is not only that I had to summarize what you said:</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.560" end="01:21:43.260" style="s2"> I have to summarize what you have said in a way that you agree with.</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.920" end="01:21:50.580" style="s2"> This is also a useful technique if there is wide variation in verbal ability among participants.</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.580" end="01:21:52.740" style="s2"> and it could be due to age, for example.</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.740" end="01:22:00.160" style="s2"> Because it could be that even if you are a bit incoherent and clumsy and partial in your approach,</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.160" end="01:22:04.420" style="s2"> if i&#39;m a big brother say i might be able to sum it up for you</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.420" end="01:22:09.160" style="s2"> in a way that is useful to you from a scaffolding perspective.</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.160" end="01:22:18.200" style="s2"> We know that human beings organize their personalities at a high level through narrative</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.200" end="01:22:22.400" style="s2"> and that narrative is not only thought, it is spoken.</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.880" end="01:22:28.200" style="s2"> You create your personality by speaking in these kinds of shared settings that you are describing.</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.200" end="01:22:32.660" style="s2"> And without that your story is fragmented and incoherent and so are you.</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.980" end="01:22:35.840" style="s2"> You can see why those ..</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.840" end="01:22:39.020" style="s2"> If those shared meals weren&#39;t so important,</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.020" end="01:22:42.160" style="s2"> people would not have evolved the ability to participate.</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.160" end="01:22:48.720" style="s2"> They are central to our social life and abandoning that in the family is really a catastrophe, I think.</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.720" end="01:22:54.420" style="s2"> -I agree with everything you just said, absolutely, with each part.</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.420" end="01:22:56.240" style="s2"> When you say, &quot;Have I distorted something?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.240" end="01:23:02.180" style="s2"> Often someone will repeat what they have heard the other person say.</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.180" end="01:23:04.060" style="s2"> And you ask: &quot;Have I distorted something?&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.060" end="01:23:06.420" style="s2"> and the person responds: &quot;Yes, I think you have distorted this&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.420" end="01:23:10.040" style="s2"> and the other person will argue and say, &quot;No, I didn&#39;t say that.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.040" end="01:23:14.820" style="s2"> and the rule of the game is: the person who is speaking,</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.880" end="01:23:21.120" style="s2"> whatever makes them feel heard, that&#39;s when you haven&#39;t distorted anything.</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.120" end="01:23:25.620" style="s2"> And it&#39;s your job to listen because the customer is always right.</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.620" end="01:23:27.940" style="s2"> -That doesn&#39;t mean you have to agree,</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.940" end="01:23:30.760" style="s2"> It means that you have to understand the damn story well.</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.760" end="01:23:34.440" style="s2"> -That&#39;s also important,</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.440" end="01:23:41.240" style="s2"> some people make a mistake thinking that if I understand what they have said,</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.240" end="01:23:45.160" style="s2"> that means that I agree with them and it doesn&#39;t mean that, it just means that you&#39;ve heard them.</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.160" end="01:23:51.800" style="s2"> Part of the purpose of a family dinner is to have the opportunity for someone to offer a personal critique,</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.800" end="01:24:00.140" style="s2"> be able to respond to that and that the person who had made that criticism hear that response</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.140" end="01:24:03.040" style="s2"> and ask if there is any distortion as to what they heard.</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.040" end="01:24:08.360" style="s2"> The biggest challenge for almost everyone,</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.360" end="01:24:11.220" style="s2"> I remember they interviewed me once for NPR and said:</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.220" end="01:24:18.060" style="s2"> &quot;People who are allied with the men&#39;s movement, they seem like prejudiced people.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.060" end="01:24:23.600" style="s2"> I said: &quot;If you call yourself progressive, like liberals do and we do,</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.600" end="01:24:27.560" style="s2"> because I consider that I am on the liberal side of most things,</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.560" end="01:24:34.020" style="s2"> So our first job is to listen when people feel heard, they stop hating. &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.340" end="01:24:40.460" style="s2"> Hate comes out of a development of not being seen,</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.460" end="01:24:42.620" style="s2"> not be heard, be distorted,</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.620" end="01:24:49.780" style="s2"> being blamed or caricatured in a negative way before being heard.</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.780" end="01:24:54.460" style="s2"> That is the job of every person who calls himself a progressive,</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.460" end="01:24:58.420" style="s2"> is to start listening instead of arguing first.</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.400" end="01:25:02.180" style="s2"> -At least you can know what to argue about.</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.060" end="01:25:07.740" style="s2"> Because one of the things that happens with crystal clear communication in a family</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.740" end="01:25:12.560" style="s2"> when stories are told it is: you can identify which are the problems and which are not.</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.560" end="01:25:16.800" style="s2"> You could be irritated having to listen to your partner</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.800" end="01:25:20.220" style="s2"> awkwardly describing a particular problem</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.220" end="01:25:25.200" style="s2"> But if you understand at the same time that they could be ruling out ninety-eight problems</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.200" end="01:25:28.960" style="s2"> and focusing on just two, it&#39;s worth the wait.</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.760" end="01:25:32.280" style="s2"> Another question for you,</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.280" end="01:25:38.080" style="s2"> there are people who are not in a position where they cannot have male involvement with their children,</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.080" end="01:25:43.320" style="s2"> let&#39;s say so what do you recommend for single moms</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.320" end="01:25:45.660" style="s2"> who are trying to do the best job possible with their children</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.660" end="01:25:48.680" style="s2"> But they have a hard time attracting male attention?</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.680" end="01:25:51.020" style="s2"> What do you think they can do?</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.020" end="01:25:58.340" style="s2"> -First, to recognize the enormous amount of multifaceted work that you are doing.</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.340" end="01:26:04.620" style="s2"> Second, as you look at the differences between what mothers and fathers do,</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.620" end="01:26:11.060" style="s2"> ask yourself if there is any way you may not have valued your former husband</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.060" end="01:26:16.820" style="s2"> in a way that would allow him to return.</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.820" end="01:26:18.820" style="s2"> But if the answer to that question is:</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.820" end="01:26:23.740" style="s2"> &quot;I&#39;ve valued him and can still get him to come back even though he&#39;s essentially lazy,&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.740" end="01:26:26.780" style="s2"> excuse my language, these are some options:</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.000" end="01:26:36.600" style="s2"> The biggest amount of evidence is that sending your children to be a Cub Scout is a ...</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.600" end="01:26:41.180" style="s2"> They have a well-developed program to develop personality motivation,</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.180" end="01:26:46.540" style="s2"> integrity, loyalty, a sense of making promises that you keep.</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.540" end="01:26:53.180" style="s2"> Very good studies have been done of boys who have participated in Scouting for two years or more.</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.180" end="01:26:58.060" style="s2"> But this means not only signing your child up for the Scouts here or there,</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.060" end="01:27:01.460" style="s2"> And if your child doesn&#39;t like something that happened,</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.460" end="01:27:05.180" style="s2"> make sure your child returns to the pen</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.180" end="01:27:11.260" style="s2"> and deal with that it shouldn&#39;t be a boy&#39;s choice to go Scouting or not,</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.260" end="01:27:14.700" style="s2"> it is part of your parental responsibilities to take it there.</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.700" end="01:27:18.860" style="s2"> Later to the Boyscouts, you don&#39;t have to be a Scout,</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.860" end="01:27:24.020" style="s2"> some (?) have good programs for young boys;</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.020" end="01:27:28.740" style="s2"> Mankind Project has good programs for young boys for the first time,</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.740" end="01:27:33.980" style="s2"> they have really good assistance to help kids in regards to their parents.</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.980" end="01:27:37.980" style="s2"> Boys Clubs have some good programs with young boys,</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.980" end="01:27:42.460" style="s2"> have your child get a good mentor;</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.460" end="01:27:47.080" style="s2"> try to take your child to a school that has a significant number of boys</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.080" end="01:27:51.560" style="s2"> at the age your child is, especially if your child is very young.</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.560" end="01:27:55.620" style="s2"> It is very important that a child does not leave a house with a single mother</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.620" end="01:28:00.900" style="s2"> to mainly female schools because the child will start looking for an identity</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.900" end="01:28:04.000" style="s2"> from someone who is normally destructive like the leader of a gang.</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.000" end="01:28:08.240" style="s2"> That will give you a false identity.</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.240" end="01:28:11.860" style="s2"> These are some of many things.</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.860" end="01:28:15.060" style="s2"> We often think that a boy needs a male mentor.</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.060" end="01:28:17.380" style="s2"> Yes, a boy needs a male mentor.</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.380" end="01:28:25.520" style="s2"> Try to evaluate mentors carefully or if you participate in faith-based communities</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.520" end="01:28:29.660" style="s2"> And even if you don&#39;t believe in God, God or not</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.660" end="01:28:32.700" style="s2"> get your child involved in a faith-based community</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.700" end="01:28:40.440" style="s2"> where there is a good male counselor who has groups for children, for youth,</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.440" end="01:28:42.820" style="s2"> often young people who have problems.</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.820" end="01:28:49.420" style="s2"> The ability to be encouraged to express your feelings to other boys</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.420" end="01:28:54.500" style="s2"> and see that your child is not isolated in the problems they face.</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.500" end="01:28:59.180" style="s2"> But there are many other boys his own age who are having the same problems.</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.180" end="01:29:03.380" style="s2"> get her to be able to express her feelings about it, her fears about it,</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.380" end="01:29:08.980" style="s2"> have little experiences where he paints a mask of himself</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.980" end="01:29:13.160" style="s2"> and what the mask says and what is said under the mask.</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.160" end="01:29:19.520" style="s2"> A mentor can greatly encourage a boy to express his feelings</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.520" end="01:29:22.580" style="s2"> instead of repressing your feelings in a society.</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.580" end="01:29:28.120" style="s2"> And then what we all need and have to do is go out there and say:</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.120" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2"> something very harmful has happened in our society in the last fifteen years.</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.600" end="01:29:37.560" style="s2"> When I started this job with the government</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.560" end="01:29:40.420" style="s2"> with the commission to create a White House Council for Boys and Men,</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.420" end="01:29:43.280" style="s2"> I started that after a call from the White House</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.280" end="01:29:48.040" style="s2"> asking if he wanted to be an advisor to the White House Council for Women and Girls</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.040" end="01:29:50.600" style="s2"> because of my background with the National Organization for Women.</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.600" end="01:29:55.240" style="s2"> And I said of course but also a White House Council for Boys and Men is needed.</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.240" end="01:29:57.620" style="s2"> For eight years we have been working to make it happen,</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.620" end="01:30:00.660" style="s2"> and now we are working with the Trump administration to make it happen,</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.660" end="01:30:04.240" style="s2"> and nobody signs up yet</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.240" end="01:30:06.580" style="s2"> but the importance of making it happen</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.580" end="01:30:12.140" style="s2"> is that there has to be a complete change in attitude and atmosphere</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.140" end="01:30:17.680" style="s2"> that we are simply not living in a world dominated by the Patriarchy,</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.680" end="01:30:20.780" style="s2"> that the world was dominated by a need to survive.</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.420" end="01:30:26.920" style="s2"> Both fathers and mothers sacrifice so much of their lives</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.920" end="01:30:29.860" style="s2"> in the hope that their children will have better lives,</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.860" end="01:30:36.740" style="s2"> mothers make career sacrifices, fathers make career sacrifices.</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.740" end="01:30:39.940" style="s2"> There are very few parents of multiple children</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.940" end="01:30:42.420" style="s2"> who follow their own ambitions</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.420" end="01:30:49.160" style="s2"> Because the jobs that satisfy you are not jobs that pay well.</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.160" end="01:30:51.620" style="s2"> Most of our parents sacrificed their satisfaction</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.620" end="01:30:56.840" style="s2"> to do the things they needed to do like be a firefighter or a miner</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.840" end="01:30:59.700" style="s2"> or be willing to be expendable and more</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.700" end="01:31:03.500" style="s2"> in order to make their generation safer and have more options.</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.500" end="01:31:07.020" style="s2"> And that all the sacrifices our parents made</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.020" end="01:31:10.060" style="s2"> be called &quot;male privilege&quot; or &quot;male dominance&quot;,</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.060" end="01:31:13.580" style="s2"> it is completely underestimating men.</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.580" end="01:31:15.180" style="s2"> All that attitude ..</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.180" end="01:31:17.720" style="s2"> -It is also underestimating women to affirm</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.720" end="01:31:22.000" style="s2"> that the entire cultural structure to this day has been patriarchal in origin.</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.000" end="01:31:26.680" style="s2"> You can argue about what is the definition of Patriarchy</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.680" end="01:31:32.020" style="s2"> but just understand that your father and your grandfather and your great-grandfather,</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.020" end="01:31:37.580" style="s2"> they all did the same thing your great-grandmothers did:</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.580" end="01:31:43.440" style="s2"> gave their lives in the hope that your life and the lives of their children</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.440" end="01:31:46.080" style="s2"> they would be better with more amounts of opportunities.</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.080" end="01:31:48.640" style="s2"> And most of them sacrificed a lot:</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.640" end="01:31:52.200" style="s2"> my father ran a company and my mother was very unhappy,</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.200" end="01:31:53.880" style="s2"> and he ran the company in Europe;</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.880" end="01:31:55.980" style="s2"> my mother was very unhappy living in Europe</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.980" end="01:31:58.620" style="s2"> rather than in the United States which was more comfortable for her.</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.620" end="01:32:01.040" style="s2"> My father finally quit his job</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.040" end="01:32:04.360" style="s2"> and sold foam brushes door to door for a year</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.360" end="01:32:06.780" style="s2"> to make sure we had enough money,</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.780" end="01:32:08.200" style="s2"> at least to go to a state university</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.200" end="01:32:12.860" style="s2"> and my mother had a decent home and so did the children.</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.860" end="01:32:17.420" style="s2"> -All that was associated with a little bit of gratitude for the past.</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.420" end="01:32:18.400" style="s2"> -It really is.</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.400" end="01:32:26.680" style="s2"> Instead of criticizing the world as patriarchal or parents as stupid, we should be saying:</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.680" end="01:32:28.860" style="s2"> mom, dad, grandfather, grandmother;</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.860" end="01:32:32.320" style="s2"> thanks for making our survival mastery enough</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.320" end="01:32:35.780" style="s2"> so that we don&#39;t have to focus so much on surviving</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.780" end="01:32:41.560" style="s2"> But let&#39;s not waste our chances blaming men for the world</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.560" end="01:32:43.280" style="s2"> they have created that it was destructive.</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.280" end="01:32:46.880" style="s2"> We have to understand that we are living fifty percent longer now</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.880" end="01:32:48.920" style="s2"> that where we were a hundred and twenty years ago</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.920" end="01:32:53.840" style="s2"> and that is the result of all the progress you have made.</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.840" end="01:32:57.460" style="s2"> This is why we have worked so hard</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.460" end="01:32:59.620" style="s2"> to create this White House Council of Boys and Men.</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.620" end="01:33:05.160" style="s2"> We have created a Patreon account to be able to get some money</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.160" end="01:33:07.460" style="s2"> to be able to make this happen</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.460" end="01:33:10.860" style="s2"> but if it happens through the Patreon account or some other way,</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.860" end="01:33:15.340" style="s2"> we need to check the belief of:</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.340" end="01:33:16.780" style="s2"> &quot;women like good, men like evil;</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.780" end="01:33:19.080" style="s2"> women as the oppressed and men as oppressors &quot;</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.080" end="01:33:24.720" style="s2"> and instead of #MeToo monologues, we need to have dialogue.</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.720" end="01:33:28.640" style="s2"> Human Resources (HR) centers are becoming HER (she),</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.640" end="01:33:32.340" style="s2"> instead of HR (RH), which is focused on her, not him and her.</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.340" end="01:33:35.660" style="s2"> We really need to have dialogues at work about what is working for women,</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.660" end="01:33:36.920" style="s2"> what is not working for women;</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.920" end="01:33:39.320" style="s2"> what is working for men and what is not working for men.</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.320" end="01:33:42.160" style="s2"> We need to fundamentally review</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.160" end="01:33:47.660" style="s2"> the roles of men, women, and all our gender roles of the past.</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.760" end="01:33:55.240" style="s2"> -That&#39;s a perfect place to close our conversation.</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.240" end="01:33:58.220" style="s2"> I would very much like to talk to you again about,</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.220" end="01:34:01.500" style="s2"> probably on the pay gap at some point.</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.500" end="01:34:06.660" style="s2"> We have focused a lot on what you have been outlining in this book, in your new book,</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.660" end="01:34:08.060" style="s2"> in The Boys&#39; Crisis,</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.060" end="01:34:13.220" style="s2"> and I certainly recommend to those who are interested in this type of topic, to buy it.</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.220" end="01:34:16.660" style="s2"> It&#39;s full of facts and that&#39;s nice.</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.660" end="01:34:19.360" style="s2"> It focuses on something that is vitally important</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.360" end="01:34:24.220" style="s2"> And I think maybe people are starting to recognize it as vitally important.</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.220" end="01:34:25.260" style="s2"> I certainly hope so.</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.020" end="01:34:28.080" style="s2"> Your work is proving very useful to me</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.080" end="01:34:32.740" style="s2"> and I really appreciate the time you spent today talking to me</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.740" end="01:34:36.620" style="s2"> and I hope we get another chance to talk again.</p>

<p begin="01:34:38.920" end="01:34:43.700" style="s2"> It really is impossible to believe that there is no patriarchal world</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.700" end="01:34:47.680" style="s2"> if you think that men charge more than women for the same work.</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.680" end="01:34:53.520" style="s2"> One has to start with a fundamental understanding that is much more complex than that.</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.520" end="01:34:57.540" style="s2"> and a much more different story than most people perceive.</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.540" end="01:35:01.460" style="s2"> -Absolutely. We will definitely mark it on the calendar.</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.460" end="01:35:03.280" style="s2"> Thank you very much.</p>
