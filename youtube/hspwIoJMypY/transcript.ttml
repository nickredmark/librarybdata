<p begin="00:00:35.690" end="00:00:41.160" style="s2">perspective but I but I&#39;d like to bring</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.160" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">down to the more practical what you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.120" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">you know here on this discord and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">this awakening from the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">community we we&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:57.690" style="s2">implement Ecology&#39;s of practices we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.910" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">been really trying to come up with you</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.690" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">know take take from established rituals</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">and borrow from them but also think</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">about what are new rituals that we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">we could enact in terms of serious play</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:16.400" style="s2">to help to help foster our perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">and participatory ways of knowing and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.400" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">suspect that there there&#39;s a lot that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">can borrow from from shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">practices you know to sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:32.790" style="s2">to apply to to us today you know for</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">example I understand you know the you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.790" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">know the ancient shamans would for</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">example have rituals where they would</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">embody a bird and that would help them</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">with hunting as they got a better sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">of how how how the birds fly and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:50.670" style="s2">they act and you know we we were we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">doing some ecstatic we have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.670" end="00:01:55.259" style="s2">practice we&#39;ve started doing ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">dance nights here and during one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.259" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">songs suddenly occurred to me to try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">embody a zombie you know John John uses</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">the symbol of the zombie so for that one</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:08.280" style="s2">song I just sort of tried to act like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">zombie and I and I thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.280" end="00:02:13.310" style="s2">there&#39;s probably something shamanistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:14.330" style="s2">about about this and and maybe there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.310" end="00:02:18.050" style="s2">are things that we can borrow from</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.330" end="00:02:21.650" style="s2">shamanism in our rituals today so I like</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.050" end="00:02:25.160" style="s2">to hear your thoughts on that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.650" end="00:02:27.110" style="s2">one particular aspect of shamanism is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.160" end="00:02:30.170" style="s2">what I might call proprioceptive</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.110" end="00:02:32.209" style="s2">imagination where you try to in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.170" end="00:02:34.550" style="s2">like harness your mirror neurons to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.209" end="00:02:36.950" style="s2">duplicate the performative structure of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.550" end="00:02:39.410" style="s2">some other part of the universe with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.950" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">idea that you could get a more than</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.410" end="00:02:44.360" style="s2">conscious understanding of how its</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:46.370" style="s2">operating you increase the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.360" end="00:02:51.590" style="s2">which your nervous system is duplicating</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.370" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">it trying to understand truly physically</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.590" end="00:02:57.140" style="s2">posture early asana so to speak going on</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.269" style="s2">with that structure so I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:03:02.269" style="s2">the things the ancient shamans tended to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.269" end="00:03:04.250" style="s2">do was to enact this receptive</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.269" end="00:03:06.410" style="s2">imagination with various creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.250" end="00:03:08.420" style="s2">impressed them I think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.410" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">general skill I know that John is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.420" end="00:03:12.530" style="s2">interested in the way that some</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:14.480" style="s2">scientists have entered into a similar</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.530" end="00:03:17.209" style="s2">kind of relationship with Mars rovers</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.480" end="00:03:19.489" style="s2">you could do it with fundamentally any</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.209" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">structure or any pattern of information</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.489" end="00:03:23.780" style="s2">that we&#39;re working with in the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:25.880" style="s2">one of the interesting things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.780" end="00:03:26.930" style="s2">Einstein said was that he tried to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.880" end="00:03:29.569" style="s2">with his muscles</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.930" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">I think that&#39;s overlooked by a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.569" end="00:03:32.840" style="s2">people who are doing intellectual work</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:34.910" style="s2">or trying to understand the universe</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.840" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">whether that means the cosmos or their</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.910" end="00:03:40.519" style="s2">own moment in history and what gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:45.230" style="s2">overlooked is the the need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.519" end="00:03:47.060" style="s2">physiological somatic flowing engagement</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.230" end="00:03:48.530" style="s2">with the pattern that you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.060" end="00:03:53.930" style="s2">think of the proud minute you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.530" end="00:03:57.230" style="s2">to understand so what would that look</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.930" end="00:03:59.510" style="s2">like for us today if you could bring it</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.230" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">down just do very practical I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.510" end="00:04:04.100" style="s2">you can bring it out to step by step but</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:08.170" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to come up trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.100" end="00:04:12.590" style="s2">identify such a pattern that we should</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.170" end="00:04:15.739" style="s2">embody how how should we go about trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.590" end="00:04:17.989" style="s2">to come up with how to do this well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.739" end="00:04:20.090" style="s2">would probably start small you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.989" end="00:04:22.039" style="s2">start like the ancient shamans would</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.090" end="00:04:24.440" style="s2">have star to start with a tree or a rock</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.039" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">or a bird or something that you see in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.440" end="00:04:27.590" style="s2">very simple way every day</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:30.530" style="s2">a number of different things try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.590" end="00:04:33.910" style="s2">build up the skill and capacity or you</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.530" end="00:04:36.500" style="s2">try to transpose that on to example</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.910" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">Derna t might be a system you think wow</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.500" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">how could I get in touch with the mo</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">spirit of modernity so to speak so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:47.000" style="s2">I could understand and critique it at a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">more than intellectual level and have to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.000" end="00:04:50.870" style="s2">embody its patterns but I can only do</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:53.150" style="s2">that if I&#39;ve had some practice trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.870" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">embody patterns that are more viscerally</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.150" end="00:04:57.110" style="s2">available to me but I would start like</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:04:58.790" style="s2">the ancient shamans did is just try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.110" end="00:05:03.350" style="s2">pick something in nature</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.790" end="00:05:06.139" style="s2">try to imagine feeling and imagine doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.350" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">its structure so to speak there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.139" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">interesting interplay between shape and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">activity the interesting things in terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">of human sexuality is that we let Mol&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:21.470" style="s2">tried to foreground features that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:24.050" style="s2">gender polarized in order to initiate</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.470" end="00:05:26.690" style="s2">mating practices so someone might put</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.050" end="00:05:30.020" style="s2">their chest forward because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.690" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">gender indicator in the species but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.020" end="00:05:34.789" style="s2">you see somebody who simply structurally</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.479" end="00:05:36.080" style="s2">built as if their chest is always coming</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.789" end="00:05:38.300" style="s2">forward and a lot of people have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.080" end="00:05:40.700" style="s2">response to that but what I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.300" end="00:05:43.910" style="s2">indicate by that is there&#39;s a very fuzzy</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.700" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">line between structure and gesture and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.910" end="00:05:49.010" style="s2">behavior there&#39;s a thing in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">thinking about a structure as if it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.010" end="00:05:54.620" style="s2">a behavior and trying to embody that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:57.020" style="s2">behavior and have a system right we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.620" end="00:05:59.930" style="s2">a system of instantly duplicating the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.020" end="00:06:02.060" style="s2">behaviors that we see is it all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.930" end="00:06:03.979" style="s2">we get stressed when we hear someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:07.250" style="s2">expressing stress and we can tap into</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.979" end="00:06:08.690" style="s2">that system try to treat structures that</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.250" end="00:06:10.700" style="s2">we see in the world as if they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.690" end="00:06:12.380" style="s2">behaviors I know that sounds really</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.700" end="00:06:14.030" style="s2">abstract but like I was saying start</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.380" end="00:06:17.060" style="s2">with really simple things but if you see</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.030" end="00:06:18.770" style="s2">a tree try to you know imagine what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.060" end="00:06:22.070" style="s2">would be like inside your own body and</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.770" end="00:06:24.650" style="s2">nervous system to do that trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.070" end="00:06:26.270" style="s2">speak what would the gesture be what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.650" end="00:06:28.130" style="s2">activity is it up to that you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.270" end="00:06:29.900" style="s2">duplicate and if you get a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.130" end="00:06:31.940" style="s2">better at that skill then you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.900" end="00:06:34.870" style="s2">transpose that into more abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.940" end="00:06:37.159" style="s2">sociological and technological domains</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.870" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">and I guess there would be a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.159" end="00:06:43.370" style="s2">of observation a very careful officer</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.680" end="00:06:47.330" style="s2">first what would the shamans do before</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.370" end="00:06:49.070" style="s2">attempting to say embody a bird would</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.330" end="00:06:52.190" style="s2">they spend a great deal of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.070" end="00:06:54.680" style="s2">observing just everything they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.190" end="00:06:57.350" style="s2">about about the bird or do you just sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.680" end="00:06:59.810" style="s2">of jump into it and that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.350" end="00:07:02.419" style="s2">variable because everybody can do</p>

<p begin="00:08:35.209" end="00:08:41.870" style="s2">I&#39;d say access multiple systems of your</p>

<p begin="00:09:23.110" end="00:09:26.260" style="s2">might be able to start having in-person</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.160" end="00:09:45.370" style="s2">design one on the spot but what what</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.580" end="00:09:47.890" style="s2">might we do together through a discord</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.370" end="00:09:53.530" style="s2">call like this now although with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.890" end="00:09:55.300" style="s2">video to to do do this practice so like</p>

<p begin="00:10:01.740" end="00:10:06.340" style="s2">everybody would need to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.210" end="00:10:08.830" style="s2">their own current state of embodiment to</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.340" end="00:10:11.020" style="s2">their neuro somatic feedback circuit</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.830" end="00:10:14.470" style="s2">right what&#39;s going on in your physiology</p>

<p begin="00:10:20.950" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">tingle sense how is that then responding</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.400" end="00:10:27.550" style="s2">to the individuals who are speaking into</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:30.970" style="s2">the rest of the group because I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.550" end="00:10:33.640" style="s2">tending to that live information is very</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.970" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">important to this process and you do a</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.640" end="00:10:39.370" style="s2">lot of information about how to talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:41.980" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing in order to tune in at</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.370" end="00:10:44.620" style="s2">the same time you&#39;ve got a circle</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.980" end="00:10:46.630" style="s2">through everybody right interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.620" end="00:10:49.420" style="s2">you have one person be the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.630" end="00:10:52.030" style="s2">speech but if want to do it like an</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.420" end="00:10:53.710" style="s2">ancient get-together then everybody has</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.030" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">to cycle through enough times for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.710" end="00:10:58.270" style="s2">everybody to sort of feel each of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:02.050" style="s2">participants and the other thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.270" end="00:11:04.990" style="s2">say is it&#39;s it&#39;s dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.050" end="00:11:07.050" style="s2">overemphasize the rationale I&#39;ve been in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.990" end="00:11:09.240" style="s2">a lot of groups where people have wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.050" end="00:11:11.940" style="s2">- I&#39;m cycle through everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.240" end="00:11:13.860" style="s2">everybody speak about you know why</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.940" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">they&#39;re here or what they&#39;re concerned</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.860" end="00:11:20.040" style="s2">about and that&#39;s very useful they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:22.140" style="s2">also often cycle through irrational</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.040" end="00:11:24.839" style="s2">elements right if we say everybody say a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.140" end="00:11:26.250" style="s2">completely meaningless thing would come</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.839" end="00:11:27.720" style="s2">from a different part of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.250" end="00:11:29.640" style="s2">it&#39;s cycled through and you had</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.720" end="00:11:31.050" style="s2">everybody make a random noise or you had</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.640" end="00:11:33.480" style="s2">everybody try to make a surrealistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.050" end="00:11:36.060" style="s2">utterance of some kind that could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.480" end="00:11:37.950" style="s2">involving the subconscious mind of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.060" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">group you&#39;d be telling the subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.950" end="00:11:43.019" style="s2">that it can play a role and in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:47.640" style="s2">shamanism you pretty much want</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.019" end="00:11:49.320" style="s2">subconscious intelligent so so would</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.640" end="00:11:52.470" style="s2">that be sort of an exercise just to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.320" end="00:11:55.110" style="s2">start off a session you know everyone</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.470" end="00:11:59.850" style="s2">make make a sound just any sound that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.110" end="00:12:01.829" style="s2">comes to mind absolutely you could do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.850" end="00:12:03.930" style="s2">that way I mean I would spend to have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.829" end="00:12:06.690" style="s2">couple of minutes where everybody spent</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.930" end="00:12:08.370" style="s2">time feeling into their body I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.690" end="00:12:10.230" style="s2">have everybody try to feel into their</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.370" end="00:12:11.550" style="s2">body as everyone else spoke but then I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.230" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">would cycle through and you could make a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.550" end="00:12:16.680" style="s2">noise you could say a random thing try</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:19.110" style="s2">to say something that doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.680" end="00:12:24.570" style="s2">to you that speaks to your feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.110" end="00:12:25.890" style="s2">the effect of the group that maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.570" end="00:12:28.230" style="s2">and then if we wanted to have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.890" end="00:12:32.339" style="s2">embodiment exercise you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.230" end="00:12:35.550" style="s2">the tree or an ant or or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.339" end="00:12:36.990" style="s2">Internet can you describe how you would</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.550" end="00:12:40.860" style="s2">envision something like that in a group</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.990" end="00:12:43.140" style="s2">setting like this you could just pick</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.860" end="00:12:47.399" style="s2">something that probably everybody has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.140" end="00:12:50.510" style="s2">good mental image of way the ancient</p>

<p begin="00:12:50.510" end="00:12:55.020" style="s2">probably speaks to things that they</p>

<p begin="00:22:34.279" end="00:22:39.169" style="s2">you and trying to figure out how you</p>

<p begin="00:22:39.169" end="00:22:44.299" style="s2">arguments more elaborate way it could be</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.870" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">try to see yourself through the eyes of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.299" end="00:22:50.899" style="s2">a raven I&#39;m still not entirely sure what</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:52.429" style="s2">you mean by symbols because symbols is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.899" end="00:23:00.590" style="s2">term that could mean a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.429" end="00:23:02.690" style="s2">things so the idea would be that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.590" end="00:23:05.240" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t personally do it right like so</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.690" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">we designed like a game which gave</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.240" end="00:23:09.890" style="s2">affordances right like would place</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:13.250" style="s2">people in a certain relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.890" end="00:23:15.980" style="s2">then they&#39;d explore it so it&#39;d be I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.250" end="00:23:18.679" style="s2">to be engaging in some way and it&#39;d have</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.679" end="00:23:24.620" style="s2">themselves right it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.450" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">Mima fireable and and the symbols would</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.620" end="00:23:31.850" style="s2">be a way of having different layers of</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:35.659" style="s2">meaning being connected to similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.850" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">things right so so that idea you could</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.659" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">integrate in the game and you could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:42.919" style="s2">like a path that&#39;s around a symbol or</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:46.840" style="s2">something where you get there</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.919" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">circumambulated that makes more sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.840" end="00:23:53.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting idea think if</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:57.470" style="s2">you can get people to try to speak from</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.990" end="00:23:59.630" style="s2">a perspective not their own especially</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.650" end="00:24:12.800" style="s2">perspective and they do that almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.550" end="00:24:14.030" style="s2">immediate consequence is a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:24:30.770" end="00:24:35.630" style="s2">that seems foreign to them especially if</p>

<p begin="00:24:35.630" end="00:24:39.140" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re likely to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.140" end="00:24:44.750" style="s2">progressively addictive to them because</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.270" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2">that energy does increase the complexity</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.260" end="00:25:05.510" style="s2">for a while okay thanks thank you Lord</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.510" end="00:25:09.770" style="s2">dr. doom just wants to know what does</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.510" end="00:25:12.820" style="s2">shamanism mean to you a good question</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.340" end="00:25:22.130" style="s2">omen ism it&#39;s a tricky term because for</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.120" end="00:25:24.020" style="s2">me personally am I not that interested</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.130" end="00:25:26.150" style="s2">in people who self-identify as shamans</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.020" end="00:25:29.450" style="s2">and I&#39;m not that interested in people</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.150" end="00:25:33.170" style="s2">who are officially designated as shamans</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.450" end="00:25:35.600" style="s2">by their indigenous group much more</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.170" end="00:25:38.990" style="s2">interested in shamanism as a general</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.600" end="00:25:41.540" style="s2">human phenomenon has existed throughout</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.990" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">history but which in a which sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.540" end="00:25:47.120" style="s2">stands at the beginning of all human</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:51.430" style="s2">yogic and spiritual traditions I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.120" end="00:25:56.320" style="s2">of shamanism as a fundamentally embodied</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.430" end="00:26:00.200" style="s2">illogically oriented City adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.320" end="00:26:03.350" style="s2">arm of proto spirituality in which the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.200" end="00:26:05.390" style="s2">basic skills that lead to religion and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.350" end="00:26:09.620" style="s2">spirituality and human development and</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.390" end="00:26:13.570" style="s2">wisdom practices all emergent out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.620" end="00:26:16.910" style="s2">human instincts within natural contexts</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.570" end="00:26:17.900" style="s2">reason I like that so much is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.910" end="00:26:22.130" style="s2">in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.900" end="00:26:24.350" style="s2">now that is kind of parallel or a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.130" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">harmonic overtone to the archaic</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.350" end="00:26:30.700" style="s2">situation situation as a civilization</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:33.950" style="s2">where we need to pattern ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.700" end="00:26:35.930" style="s2">relationship to ecology we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.950" end="00:26:38.630" style="s2">much more embodied in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.930" end="00:26:42.140" style="s2">thinking will be more psychedelic in</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.630" end="00:26:45.380" style="s2">terms of our thinking and to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.140" end="00:26:47.780" style="s2">generate as of ritual and consecration</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.380" end="00:26:54.010" style="s2">rather than rely on the forms that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.780" end="00:26:58.160" style="s2">inherited we need to be able to form</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.010" end="00:27:01.130" style="s2">individual search into weirdness and try</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.160" end="00:27:03.620" style="s2">to help the tribe with the results of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.130" end="00:27:09.820" style="s2">our individual inquiry into unusual</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.620" end="00:27:12.920" style="s2">domains I think that&#39;s a huge current it</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.820" end="00:27:16.070" style="s2">echoes very strongly the types of</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.920" end="00:27:19.460" style="s2">practices we can imagine were present</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.070" end="00:27:21.650" style="s2">prior to the recorded history human</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.460" end="00:27:24.170" style="s2">spirituality and religion and metal</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.650" end="00:27:27.170" style="s2">practice and so for me shamanism means</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.170" end="00:27:29.450" style="s2">that original state also the way in</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.170" end="00:27:35.050" style="s2">which the capacities of that original</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.450" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">state apply to our currents that is</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.050" end="00:27:43.010" style="s2">fascinating thank you can I ask a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">follow-up just please okay so I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.010" end="00:27:46.550" style="s2">into philosophy for for multitude</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.700" style="s2">reasons I want to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.550" end="00:27:51.260" style="s2">universe first of all but then at once I</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.700" end="00:27:52.820" style="s2">started learning from people like Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.820" end="00:27:58.010" style="s2">interested in existential philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.860" end="00:28:00.170" style="s2">I think that that touches exactly on</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.010" end="00:28:02.800" style="s2">what shamanism is that that embodied</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.170" end="00:28:06.620" style="s2">experience so which you have any</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.480" end="00:28:15.650" style="s2">a form of practice to you and say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.910" end="00:28:19.210" style="s2">your favorite your favorite sense of</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.750" end="00:34:10.040" style="s2">socially designated I think we were</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.320" end="00:34:13.140" style="s2">having a conversation yesterday with</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.040" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">Alan and one of the things he mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.140" end="00:34:19.290" style="s2">actually where shamans and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:23.100" style="s2">there are groups where even if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:25.110" style="s2">warring the shaman can in the middle of</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.110" end="00:34:32.280" style="s2">falling prey to the tribal tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:34.620" style="s2">for war for example and so I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.280" end="00:34:37.560" style="s2">wondering at that point what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.620" end="00:34:41.850" style="s2">connection is between shamanism and</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.560" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">sacred ism or the sacred and and what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.850" end="00:34:47.790" style="s2">can sort of learn and you can integrate</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:49.830" style="s2">you know in terms of shamanic practices</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.790" end="00:34:53.550" style="s2">to a group and and and maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.830" end="00:34:57.180" style="s2">comment a little on how how the one</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.550" end="00:34:59.310" style="s2">having one shaman can service a group of</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.180" end="00:35:01.500" style="s2">people even in different tribes for it</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.310" end="00:35:05.790" style="s2">what that relationship sort of looks</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.500" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">like to you that&#39;s a great question I</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.790" end="00:35:11.010" style="s2">think it has a couple of different</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:15.360" style="s2">components and one of them is the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:18.650" style="s2">has a socially elevated position in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.360" end="00:35:21.690" style="s2">Asian cultures right the same way that</p>

<p begin="00:38:29.190" end="00:38:36.569" style="s2">gonna go here I think is that it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:39.380" style="s2">like in some ways the more the idea of</p>

<p begin="00:39:18.150" end="00:39:25.740" style="s2">you feel oh yeah I would agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.809" end="00:39:26.190" style="s2">I would think that way we&#39;ve done IQ for</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.190" end="00:39:32.310" style="s2">little while for the modernity period so</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.130" end="00:39:34.830" style="s2">to speak that we&#39;ve hyper focused on</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.310" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">things that were adaptive intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.830" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">capacities in terms of the of</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:50.220" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s a um derivation and a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.240" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">specialization from the generalized</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.900" end="00:40:35.370" style="s2">currently think of as IQ is somewhat of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.480" end="00:40:37.350" style="s2">a specialized subset of generalized yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.370" end="00:40:42.120" style="s2">that&#39;s that excellent that gives me a</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.350" end="00:40:43.890" style="s2">lot to chew on and it&#39;s interesting with</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.120" end="00:40:45.450" style="s2">some of the current discussions we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.890" end="00:40:50.790" style="s2">going on here so I appreciate that thank</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.450" end="00:40:53.700" style="s2">you so we live in a skeptical age where</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.790" end="00:40:57.000" style="s2">you know respect for some of the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.700" end="00:40:59.730" style="s2">traditions have have elapsed let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.000" end="00:41:03.060" style="s2">what do you say to the modern skeptic</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.730" end="00:41:06.210" style="s2">who sort of scoffs at these tiny types</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.060" end="00:41:09.590" style="s2">of ancient practices and things you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.210" end="00:41:12.550" style="s2">what do I have to learn from from these</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.590" end="00:41:16.630" style="s2">from the Stone Age</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.550" end="00:41:18.310" style="s2">these Stone Age practices I&#39;ll approach</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.630" end="00:41:21.280" style="s2">it in a couple of ways first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.310" end="00:41:25.210" style="s2">would say these people aren&#39;t skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.280" end="00:41:27.540" style="s2">enough they&#39;re not uh yet skeptical of</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.210" end="00:41:30.220" style="s2">their own metaphysical assumptions I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.540" end="00:41:32.369" style="s2">think he is generally post metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.220" end="00:41:35.290" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t just mean on</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.369" end="00:41:38.010" style="s2">traditional cosmological mythology it</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.290" end="00:41:41.230" style="s2">also means beyond the sort of background</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.010" end="00:41:44.440" style="s2">assumptions that characterize modernity</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.230" end="00:41:47.490" style="s2">and mystic science as well that these a</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.440" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">lot of these things are still undecided</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.490" end="00:41:52.210" style="s2">even the notion of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:55.599" style="s2">decidability is problematic so we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.210" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">to be very basically agnostic and</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.599" end="00:41:59.710" style="s2">skeptical in a lot of ways and have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:01.150" style="s2">good conscience about that so I would</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.710" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">say to the skeptic they should become</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.150" end="00:42:08.619" style="s2">even more skeptical but also say that</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:12.599" style="s2">human bio machinery is roughly constant</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.619" end="00:42:15.910" style="s2">over the period of human history that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.599" end="00:42:17.890" style="s2">we may be in different informational and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.910" end="00:42:20.500" style="s2">social circumstances now than our</p>

<p begin="00:42:23.050" end="00:42:28.000" style="s2">the same neural physiology and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.180" end="00:42:31.030" style="s2">the same basic needs and capacities that</p>

<p begin="00:42:33.550" end="00:42:38.770" style="s2">capacities from stances that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.800" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">necessarily have example if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.770" end="00:42:46.390" style="s2">to to grade all of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:48.280" style="s2">understood to one whole who would have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.390" end="00:42:51.310" style="s2">better chance of doing that if you only</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.280" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2">knew a thousand things if you had knew a</p>

<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:34.420" style="s2">do you see shamanistic practices like</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.180" end="00:43:38.660" style="s2">cup coming back or do you do you see</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.420" end="00:43:42.799" style="s2">alright are you optimistic about about</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.660" end="00:43:46.849" style="s2">that possibility is see fragments of it</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.849" end="00:43:50.869" style="s2">right the reason we&#39;re having this</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.859" end="00:43:52.309" style="s2">discussion is it&#39;s coming up for me but</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.869" end="00:43:55.240" style="s2">not just for me it&#39;s coming up for you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.309" end="00:43:57.470" style="s2">guys right the way John talks about</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.240" end="00:44:01.430" style="s2">embodiment is a fundamental feature of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.470" end="00:44:03.349" style="s2">cognitive science the way all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.430" end="00:44:06.559" style="s2">different spiritual teachers are</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.349" end="00:44:09.010" style="s2">focusing more on motion and embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.559" end="00:44:12.559" style="s2">then maybe they did a hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.010" end="00:44:15.069" style="s2">the way that we are all socially hyper</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.559" end="00:44:17.960" style="s2">attuned to the fact that we are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.069" end="00:44:20.289" style="s2">coordinate with the patterns of organic</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.960" end="00:44:24.500" style="s2">complexity that make the ecosystem run</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.289" end="00:44:26.109" style="s2">way that psychedelics and altered states</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.500" end="00:44:28.609" style="s2">of consciousness are becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.109" end="00:44:32.660" style="s2">decriminalized and renormalized in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.609" end="00:44:35.750" style="s2">therapy in art in sofia and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.660" end="00:44:37.490" style="s2">a lot of very optimistic signs that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.750" end="00:44:40.940" style="s2">something that will eventually converge</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.490" end="00:44:43.299" style="s2">on a new one ISM is bubbling up all over</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.940" end="00:44:43.299" style="s2">the place</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.260" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">definitely I think John John&#39;s course is</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.750" end="00:44:55.010" style="s2">what brought me back to having a respect</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.400" end="00:44:57.109" style="s2">for these these ancient traditions so</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.010" end="00:44:59.770" style="s2">hopefully we can play our part in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.109" end="00:45:03.230" style="s2">at that as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.770" end="00:45:06.230" style="s2">fact a lot of what are very simple ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:07.549" style="s2">you know there was a study the details</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.230" end="00:45:10.309" style="s2">escaped me in the mall but there was a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.549" end="00:45:12.170" style="s2">German town that was tested in the 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.309" end="00:45:14.809" style="s2">for visual and auditory acuity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.170" end="00:45:16.760" style="s2">students though a hundred years later</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.809" end="00:45:19.460" style="s2">they thought it would be good to retest</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.760" end="00:45:20.750" style="s2">them turned out that all of the students</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.460" end="00:45:23.359" style="s2">at the same grade level had</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.750" end="00:45:26.539" style="s2">significantly diminished in Victorian</p>

<p begin="00:45:26.539" end="00:45:32.660" style="s2">theorize why that might be that guess</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.510" end="00:45:35.690" style="s2">was that these kids were more exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.660" end="00:45:38.270" style="s2">human technological environments</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.690" end="00:45:41.210" style="s2">or stones and colors were very simple</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.740" end="00:47:46.119" style="s2">shamanism but I have a general respect</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.220" end="00:47:48.260" style="s2">and value traditions which have</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.730" end="00:47:58.070" style="s2">cognition and so the question that I ask</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.120" end="00:48:02.090" style="s2">although it may in some sense sound and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.070" end="00:48:03.890" style="s2">charitable is in the spirit of looking</p>

<p begin="00:48:03.890" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">traditions can be preserved and was and</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.320" style="s2">the groundwork it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.210" end="00:48:15.320" style="s2">shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.320" end="00:48:20.470" style="s2">and wisdom traditions things like it</p>

<p begin="00:48:23.270" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">competed by other sorts of ideas in</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.640" end="00:48:31.430" style="s2">other ways of being perhaps lost a lot</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:36.770" style="s2">has been lost there my concern remains</p>

<p begin="00:59:23.290" end="00:59:30.580" style="s2">us think someone is charismatic they</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.540" end="00:59:33.160" style="s2">acting in a way that represents an idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.580" end="00:59:36.460" style="s2">that we like and we project our energy</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.460" end="00:59:43.480" style="s2">own stimulation patterns or that we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.730" end="00:59:46.870" style="s2">on our own reactions and let that</p>

<p begin="00:59:54.070" end="00:59:58.390" style="s2">are obsessively projecting their own</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.390" end="01:00:08.890" style="s2">kind so I was really caught by this idea</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.680" end="01:00:12.880" style="s2">of performance the way I envisioned it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.890" end="01:00:15.780" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a space that&#39;s generated</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:21.670" style="s2">by the crowd right like a potential</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.780" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">resonance and that maybe there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.670" end="01:00:27.670" style="s2">performance is like a shamanistic</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:29.140" style="s2">embodiment of that resonance and that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.670" end="01:00:32.650" style="s2">you could play with it right you could</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.140" end="01:00:36.040" style="s2">steer it into the correct direction by</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.650" end="01:00:40.060" style="s2">staying true to yourself and to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.040" end="01:00:44.520" style="s2">world I guess so so you can focus that</p>

<p begin="01:00:46.440" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">different ways to do it</p>

<p begin="01:04:18.140" end="01:04:25.819" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.510" end="01:04:29.310" style="s2">information need to chew on that Thanks</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.819" end="01:04:33.660" style="s2">well surely the ratio isn&#39;t always 50/50</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.310" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">I just mean that it&#39;s a gamble like any</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.660" end="01:04:37.140" style="s2">any time you were to go I do</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">hypnotherapy and any time you put</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.140" end="01:04:41.550" style="s2">yourself in you allow yourself to go</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:44.700" style="s2">into a trance that someone else is</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.550" end="01:04:47.130" style="s2">guiding you&#39;re taking a risk I have to</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.700" end="01:04:49.290" style="s2">trust them of some reason to believe</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.130" end="01:04:51.089" style="s2">that the trance they enable you to go</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.290" end="01:04:55.940" style="s2">into is going to be useful for you</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.089" end="01:04:55.940" style="s2">rather than diluting misleading for you</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:03.329" style="s2">do use their criteria to make the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.359" end="01:05:05.520" style="s2">evaluation right right so also doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.329" end="01:05:11.069" style="s2">hypnotherapy I&#39;m assuming you offer that</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.520" end="01:05:12.930" style="s2">as a service then it so you do you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.069" end="01:05:14.760" style="s2">the sense then that it&#39;s worthwhile to</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.930" end="01:05:17.310" style="s2">just spend an extended period of time</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.760" end="01:05:18.810" style="s2">getting to know them and have them get</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.310" end="01:05:20.790" style="s2">to trust you before you perform the</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.810" end="01:05:22.530" style="s2">service or is it is it something that</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.790" end="01:05:23.540" style="s2">can be done in a relatively short period</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.530" end="01:05:27.060" style="s2">of time</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.540" end="01:05:31.350" style="s2">depends a lot upon the individual hey I</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.060" end="01:05:34.050" style="s2">would prefer they spent Mort for some</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.350" end="01:05:35.700" style="s2">people they have need is much more</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.050" end="01:05:41.580" style="s2">urgent and they&#39;re much more willing to</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.700" end="01:05:43.770" style="s2">take the risk yeah I I tend to do it in</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.580" end="01:05:46.050" style="s2">a certain way that satisfies my own</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.770" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">conscience which is I try to do as</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.050" end="01:05:52.350" style="s2">little directing as a bowl but I can</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:55.230" style="s2">feel secure about how I work with them</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.350" end="01:05:57.540" style="s2">san sees that there&#39;s an intelligence in</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.230" end="01:05:58.230" style="s2">the unconscious in the trance state</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.540" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.230" end="01:06:04.440" style="s2">I can evoke in them and it will guide</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:07.470" style="s2">them rather than telling me their</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.440" end="01:06:08.880" style="s2">problem and me hypothetically helping</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.470" end="01:06:10.590" style="s2">them out with it right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.880" end="01:06:12.690" style="s2">hypothetically in the sense that they</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.590" end="01:06:16.590" style="s2">have no absolute reason to believe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.690" end="01:06:19.950" style="s2">going to be helpful um but what I try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.590" end="01:06:21.660" style="s2">do is them in touch with a part of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.950" end="01:06:25.470" style="s2">themselves that&#39;s smarter than they are</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.660" end="01:06:27.060" style="s2">is yes right that&#39;s exactly how I</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.470" end="01:06:29.790" style="s2">describe it here very often</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.060" end="01:06:32.190" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s obviously something</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.790" end="01:06:34.740" style="s2">going on than there the straights</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.190" end="01:06:36.120" style="s2">extraordinary capacity you see it</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.740" end="01:06:39.870" style="s2">isolated from time to time and things</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.120" end="01:06:43.290" style="s2">like idiot savants or some found</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.870" end="01:06:45.270" style="s2">cognitive function and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.290" end="01:06:47.280" style="s2">certainly demonstrated in like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.270" end="01:06:50.280" style="s2">psychedelic experience right where</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.280" end="01:06:51.600" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of self-organizing re</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.280" end="01:06:54.990" style="s2">understanding of the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.600" end="01:06:58.910" style="s2">presented in some strange way yeah like</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.990" end="01:07:03.530" style="s2">really did let people become unafraid of</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.910" end="01:07:07.500" style="s2">speaking what they truly desire and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.530" end="01:07:10.920" style="s2">presenting to that desire and in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.500" end="01:07:14.550" style="s2">receptive way they seem to work it out</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.920" end="01:07:18.540" style="s2">themselves world that we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.550" end="01:07:21.900" style="s2">it is on such chaos and complexity in</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.540" end="01:07:26.400" style="s2">every direction there it&#39;s the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.900" end="01:07:28.410" style="s2">mass weirdness of going on the level of</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.400" end="01:07:31.920" style="s2">the economy and politics and</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.410" end="01:07:34.470" style="s2">civilization whether it&#39;s the increasing</p>

<p begin="01:07:40.320" end="01:07:45.510" style="s2">we can barely comprehend the complexity</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.900" end="01:07:47.100" style="s2">of the situation we face the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.510" end="01:07:49.890" style="s2">overwhelming and we need our</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.100" end="01:07:51.870" style="s2">intelligence systems that are better</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.890" end="01:07:54.330" style="s2">than us so to speak and that means</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.870" end="01:07:55.830" style="s2">collective intelligence computational</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.330" end="01:07:58.620" style="s2">intelligence and subconscious</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.830" end="01:08:01.530" style="s2">intelligence those all are only</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.620" end="01:08:04.050" style="s2">effective when we can encourage them to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.530" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">actually operate a level that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.050" end="01:08:10.770" style="s2">sophisticated than we are right now the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:12.300" style="s2">full stack yeah I think it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.770" end="01:08:15.120" style="s2">it&#39;s vital that we I mean this is kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.300" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">of like an educational protocol right</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.120" end="01:08:19.650" style="s2">like it to be plugged into each of this</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.570" style="s2">in terms of understanding how they</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.650" end="01:08:23.010" style="s2">interrelate and becoming proficient at</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.570" end="01:08:26.390" style="s2">the tools that are used at each of those</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.010" end="01:08:28.980" style="s2">layers I think that is what produces a</p>

<p begin="01:09:02.520" end="01:09:06.030" style="s2">which we have to cross a mystery in</p>
