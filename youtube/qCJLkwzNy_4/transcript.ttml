<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:56.520" style="s2">Dan this is the third episode in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.059" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">series on climate science and responding</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.520" end="00:01:00.539" style="s2">to climate change let&#39;s start with how</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">did a geologist get interested in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.539" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">climate change well as a geologist I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">actually a geochemist my interest really</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:12.930" style="s2">came through trying to reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">ancient environments a big part of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.930" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">work involves studying earth history I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:19.080" style="s2">interested in how the environment has</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.210" style="s2">changed over time over billions of years</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.080" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">over millions of years over thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.210" end="00:01:25.259" style="s2">years and that includes the record of</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">climate change in earth history and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.259" end="00:01:30.570" style="s2">some ways our understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">future of climate change rests heavily</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.570" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">on our understanding of natural climate</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">variability in the past the earth has</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:41.729" style="s2">experienced huge climate changes over</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">various time scales but this is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.729" end="00:01:46.259" style="s2">like what we&#39;ve experienced in the past</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">but it still frames our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.259" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">and helps us constrain the range of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:51.930" style="s2">possible outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">yeah and as I understand it the range is</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.930" end="00:01:56.520" style="s2">really huge going back to the snowball</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">earth does that still a live hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.520" end="00:01:59.479" style="s2">that at one point the earth was almost</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:01.860" style="s2">entirely covered with ice</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.479" end="00:02:05.340" style="s2">absolutely and there are even lessons</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.860" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">from the snowball earth for our future</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.340" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">as well no there have been extreme</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">climate changes over Earth history and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:13.569" style="s2">think for me they&#39;ve helped me</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:15.159" style="s2">appreciate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.569" end="00:02:18.790" style="s2">what I think of as the timescales of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.159" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">climate change and that&#39;s I think an</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.790" end="00:02:23.950" style="s2">interesting part of it starting about</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:26.260" style="s2">twenty years ago I was mostly working on</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.950" end="00:02:30.609" style="s2">Paleo climate but I would give talks on</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.260" end="00:02:32.379" style="s2">climate change and I would give a talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.609" end="00:02:34.689" style="s2">about the history of climate you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.379" end="00:02:37.299" style="s2">you probably saw me give a talk like</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.689" end="00:02:40.919" style="s2">that in Santa Fe many years ago and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.299" end="00:02:43.840" style="s2">would end you know and maybe in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.919" end="00:02:45.639" style="s2">minute or two of the talk would I&#39;m wave</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.840" end="00:02:48.579" style="s2">about what we should do about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.639" end="00:02:51.609" style="s2">and I think I began personally they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.579" end="00:02:53.349" style="s2">very frustrated with that that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.609" end="00:02:57.340" style="s2">happy giving a talk about a huge problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.349" end="00:02:58.870" style="s2">that was a planetary crisis but didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.340" end="00:03:00.549" style="s2">have much to say about what what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.870" end="00:03:03.219" style="s2">should do about it and so I actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.549" end="00:03:06.040" style="s2">started systematically thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.219" end="00:03:08.799" style="s2">studying and working on devoting a part</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.040" end="00:03:10.389" style="s2">of my research effort to thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.799" end="00:03:12.579" style="s2">energy technology and then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.389" end="00:03:14.230" style="s2">energy policy as well and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.579" end="00:03:14.609" style="s2">become a big part of my portfolio as</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.230" end="00:03:16.959" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.609" end="00:03:19.030" style="s2">cool yeah I&#39;ve heard you talk on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.959" end="00:03:21.879" style="s2">topic multiple times it s if I actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.030" end="00:03:24.069" style="s2">attended the first s fi climate summer</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.879" end="00:03:26.019" style="s2">school where you talk dad as I recall oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.069" end="00:03:27.370" style="s2">wow that&#39;s the long time ago I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.019" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">yeah it really was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.370" end="00:03:31.209" style="s2">I remember the crowd trying to hush me</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:33.579" style="s2">when I started asking questions about</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.209" end="00:03:35.169" style="s2">geoengineering as if that was a bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.579" end="00:03:36.790" style="s2">thing to talk about but we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.169" end="00:03:37.900" style="s2">geoengineering oh I hope we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.790" end="00:03:40.239" style="s2">about it&#39;s a very important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.900" end="00:03:42.009" style="s2">talk about exactly I was into</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.239" end="00:03:44.139" style="s2">geoengineering when Indira engineering</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.009" end="00:03:46.780" style="s2">wasn&#39;t cool so one of the things about</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.139" end="00:03:48.009" style="s2">the history that has caught my attention</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.780" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">is I&#39;ve read a paper</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.009" end="00:03:52.269" style="s2">I don&#39;t not too long ago about some time</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">and they&#39;re not really deep ancient</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.269" end="00:03:55.209" style="s2">paths I believe it was when we were</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:57.790" style="s2">coming out of one of the Ice Ages or one</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.209" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">of the fluctuations around Ice Age there</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.790" end="00:04:03.099" style="s2">was a very rapid increase in atmospheric</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:06.250" style="s2">temperature approximately 15 C degrees</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.099" end="00:04:09.579" style="s2">in 50 years is that a fact or fiction</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.250" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">would you say so I I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.579" end="00:04:15.219" style="s2">fact out of context and let me explain</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:17.560" style="s2">what was happening so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.219" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">surprises one of the lessons that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.560" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">learned from the Paleo climate record</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:22.950" style="s2">climate at least locally doesn&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:24.780" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.950" end="00:04:28.980" style="s2">slowly there could be what are called</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.780" end="00:04:32.190" style="s2">abrupt changes that being said the exact</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.980" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">best examples of abrupt changes are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.190" end="00:04:37.890" style="s2">really global or at least they may have</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:40.110" style="s2">some larger than regional impacts but</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.890" end="00:04:43.380" style="s2">they&#39;re not but but to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.110" end="00:04:45.840" style="s2">whole world warmed by 15 degrees is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.380" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">gross misstatement but where this comes</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.840" end="00:04:50.220" style="s2">from is the ice core records from</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:51.570" style="s2">Greenland they&#39;re very interesting ice</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:53.190" style="s2">core records from Greenland are very</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.570" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">different from Antarctica</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.190" end="00:04:57.450" style="s2">partly because Greenland is really not a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:04:59.820" style="s2">polar glacier it&#39;s it&#39;s a more temperate</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.450" end="00:05:02.820" style="s2">glacier it&#39;s high latitude but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.820" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">sitting up at the pole and during the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.820" end="00:05:08.280" style="s2">last ice age between 20,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:09.270" style="s2">and say about 70 or 80 thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.280" end="00:05:12.090" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.270" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">Greenland shows some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.090" end="00:05:18.510" style="s2">and very large temperature changes where</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:21.000" style="s2">there were abrupt warming and as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.510" end="00:05:25.410" style="s2">said it&#39;s it&#39;s between 10 and 20 degrees</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.000" end="00:05:28.350" style="s2">Celsius of warming and it happened in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.410" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">some cases extremely fast not faster</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:33.510" style="s2">than 50 years and probably in just a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:36.150" style="s2">years so this is extraordinarily fast</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.510" end="00:05:38.820" style="s2">warming 10 or 20 degrees Celsius in just</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.150" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">a few years and then temperatures would</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.820" end="00:05:43.140" style="s2">slowly cool down and then a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.420" style="s2">abruptly cool down again in just a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.140" end="00:05:47.010" style="s2">years they would return to their very</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.420" end="00:05:50.370" style="s2">cold state they were in during the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.010" end="00:05:53.090" style="s2">ice age so those are called dance guard</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.370" end="00:05:56.130" style="s2">occurring events named after two</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.090" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">scandinavian scientists hans oscar and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.130" end="00:06:01.290" style="s2">willie dance guard who are poor pioneers</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:03.870" style="s2">in the ice core field and helped to sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.290" end="00:06:05.220" style="s2">of discover these cycles the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.870" end="00:06:07.320" style="s2">that people have made is that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.220" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">therefore assumed that the greenland ice</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.320" end="00:06:13.020" style="s2">core implies that the whole northern</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:15.030" style="s2">hemisphere was changing by that much and</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.020" end="00:06:17.180" style="s2">it turns out that&#39;s really the mistake</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.030" end="00:06:20.190" style="s2">so what you&#39;re saying is exactly correct</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:23.970" style="s2">records from greenland do show and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.190" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">was a big one that happened about 15,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.970" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">years ago during the d glaciation but</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">these very abrupt warming&#39;s happened but</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:35.380" style="s2">they really appear to be very local in</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:37.180" style="s2">scope that is they had a hue</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.380" end="00:06:38.950" style="s2">temperature change on the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.180" end="00:06:41.860" style="s2">Greenland ice sheet three kilometers</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.950" end="00:06:43.750" style="s2">above the surface if you actually went</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.860" end="00:06:45.270" style="s2">to Europe you would see them but they</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.750" end="00:06:48.340" style="s2">would be much more subtle they might be</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.270" end="00:06:50.170" style="s2">fractions of a degree or maybe one or</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.340" end="00:06:53.170" style="s2">two degrees or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.170" end="00:06:55.180" style="s2">see right similar patterns in caves in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.170" end="00:06:57.190" style="s2">China that have to do with precipitation</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.180" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">patterns and changes in the jet stream</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.190" end="00:07:02.620" style="s2">but again much more subtle they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.570" style="s2">huge temperature changes so this isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.620" end="00:07:06.010" style="s2">global change we actually think it has</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.570" end="00:07:09.460" style="s2">to do with the distribution of sea ice</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.010" end="00:07:11.680" style="s2">and the very large amplifying effect of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.460" end="00:07:13.540" style="s2">the ice sheets and in fact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:15.700" style="s2">interesting is you don&#39;t see these kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.540" end="00:07:19.320" style="s2">of variability when the ice sheets melt</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.700" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">and they go away so since about you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.320" end="00:07:25.090" style="s2">10,000 years ago we don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">variability like that in fact the name</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.090" end="00:07:30.550" style="s2">for the recent period the Holocene is</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:33.160" style="s2">named because of its climate relative</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.550" end="00:07:35.950" style="s2">stability so that&#39;s kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.160" end="00:07:39.730" style="s2">that&#39;s very good context and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.950" end="00:07:41.980" style="s2">about 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.730" end="00:07:44.530" style="s2">go civilization will survive that might</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.980" end="00:07:47.710" style="s2">be unpleasant but 15 degrees C and 10</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.530" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">years we&#39;d be completely glad to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.710" end="00:07:52.270" style="s2">hear the bat seems unlikely yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:53.530" style="s2">not gonna happen but but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.270" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">said at the same time don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.530" end="00:07:58.120" style="s2">underestimate how big a change one and a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:00.900" style="s2">half degrees is why don&#39;t I have degrees</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.120" end="00:08:03.490" style="s2">Celsius is a lot of temperature change</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.900" end="00:08:05.560" style="s2">just to give some perspective on this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.490" end="00:08:08.200" style="s2">the difference in global temperature</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.560" end="00:08:11.200" style="s2">between the glacial maximum 20,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.200" end="00:08:14.260" style="s2">ago when we had an ice sheet covering</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.200" end="00:08:15.820" style="s2">half of North America the ice came you</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.260" end="00:08:19.150" style="s2">know where I&#39;m sitting in Boston was</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.820" end="00:08:21.100" style="s2">under a kilometer of ice down in New</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.150" end="00:08:22.540" style="s2">York is where the glaciers ended you</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.100" end="00:08:25.510" style="s2">know you had all of Canada being covered</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.540" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">by ice part of the northern US there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.510" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">so much ice on continents 20,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">ago that sea level was about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">and thirty meters lower than today</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:35.320" style="s2">that&#39;s how much water was taken out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.430" end="00:08:39.130" style="s2">the ocean and put onto land in the form</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.320" end="00:08:40.630" style="s2">of snow and ultimately ice so so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.130" end="00:08:43.410" style="s2">a big deal and the global temperature</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.630" end="00:08:46.089" style="s2">change was about five degrees Celsius so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.410" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">think about when you talk about one and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.089" end="00:08:49.610" style="s2">a half or two degrees warming you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:51.620" style="s2">to calibrate people</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.610" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">five degrees is the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.620" end="00:08:56.630" style="s2">the last glacial maximum 20,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:59.450" style="s2">ago and today so two degrees is still a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.630" end="00:09:01.910" style="s2">really big deal and five degrees warmer</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.450" end="00:09:03.980" style="s2">you know is is like a completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.910" end="00:09:05.930" style="s2">different planet so if we go to five</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.980" end="00:09:07.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very very very bad I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.930" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">about where we get if we burned all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.880" end="00:09:11.750" style="s2">coal it might even be worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:14.060" style="s2">oh absolutely but I think I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.750" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">important to understand you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.060" end="00:09:18.170" style="s2">been giving talks recently to public</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">audiences and climate change and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.170" end="00:09:22.130" style="s2">there&#39;s so many details and there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.870" style="s2">much complexity in climate science I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.130" end="00:09:26.330" style="s2">tried to distill down what I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:29.300" style="s2">over 25 years of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.330" end="00:09:31.010" style="s2">problem and and I think there are two</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.300" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">essential elements that everybody needs</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.010" end="00:09:34.760" style="s2">to understand and the rest is detail the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:36.920" style="s2">rest are fascinating details and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.760" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">could talk for hours about those details</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.920" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">but the two really important elements</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:45.080" style="s2">are one that this is fundamentally a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:48.230" style="s2">collective action problem that is global</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.080" end="00:09:50.900" style="s2">and humans are really bad at collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.230" end="00:09:53.300" style="s2">action problems and when I say that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.900" end="00:09:56.750" style="s2">mean that that this isn&#39;t about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.300" end="00:10:00.980" style="s2">just China or the US and it really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.750" end="00:10:03.710" style="s2">requires global cooperation to fix the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.980" end="00:10:05.960" style="s2">problem you know doesn&#39;t mean that every</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.710" end="00:10:10.100" style="s2">last person needs to be completely</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.960" end="00:10:12.140" style="s2">fossil free but essentially world</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.100" end="00:10:14.960" style="s2">society needs to stop using fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.140" end="00:10:17.570" style="s2">and we need to stop increasing co2 in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.960" end="00:10:19.580" style="s2">the atmosphere the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.570" end="00:10:23.030" style="s2">problem is that every aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.580" end="00:10:25.340" style="s2">problem has long timescales and put</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.030" end="00:10:27.260" style="s2">together those two components are killer</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.340" end="00:10:29.960" style="s2">I&#39;ll talk more about what that means</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.260" end="00:10:32.150" style="s2">these long timescales but I I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.960" end="00:10:35.300" style="s2">timescale of the climate system the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.150" end="00:10:36.650" style="s2">oceans the ice sheets also the timescale</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.300" end="00:10:39.290" style="s2">of the carbon cycle which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.650" end="00:10:41.660" style="s2">unbelievably long and finally and this</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.290" end="00:10:43.820" style="s2">is the part that a lot of people in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.660" end="00:10:45.800" style="s2">technology world or in or you know who</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.820" end="00:10:47.810" style="s2">think about innovation don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.800" end="00:10:50.150" style="s2">understand which is the time scale for</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.810" end="00:10:52.730" style="s2">energies the energy system is also</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.150" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">unfortunately very long this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.730" end="00:10:56.450" style="s2">something we can actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:10:58.100" style="s2">change we can&#39;t turn on a dime that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.450" end="00:10:59.870" style="s2">quickly but I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.100" end="00:11:02.259" style="s2">fundamental because we&#39;re dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.870" end="00:11:03.759" style="s2">global collective action problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.259" end="00:11:06.759" style="s2">the likes of which we&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.759" end="00:11:09.459" style="s2">dealt with before and coupled with</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.759" end="00:11:12.040" style="s2">longtime skills and humans are really</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.459" end="00:11:13.809" style="s2">bad at both of those things yep thank</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.040" end="00:11:15.369" style="s2">you we&#39;ll get into a lot of those topics</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.809" end="00:11:17.079" style="s2">as we go along but I like to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.369" end="00:11:18.189" style="s2">particularly call out collective action</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.079" end="00:11:20.679" style="s2">problems one of the things I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.189" end="00:11:22.629" style="s2">highlighted again and again in the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.679" end="00:11:25.179" style="s2">problem of how we build a social</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.629" end="00:11:26.470" style="s2">operating system and the best book I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.179" end="00:11:29.139" style="s2">ever read on the collective action</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.470" end="00:11:30.729" style="s2">problem is by Mansur Olson it&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.139" end="00:11:33.639" style="s2">called the logic of collective action</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.729" end="00:11:35.019" style="s2">and that encouraged our listeners to go</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.639" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">read that book they want to know more</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.019" end="00:11:39.910" style="s2">about how hard it is for groups of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:42.129" style="s2">people to actually get together and do</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.910" end="00:11:44.709" style="s2">the right thing let&#39;s move on to a</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.129" end="00:11:46.299" style="s2">little bit more detail in discussions of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.709" end="00:11:48.759" style="s2">climate change we hear a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.299" end="00:11:50.410" style="s2">climate models ensembles of climate</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.759" end="00:11:51.879" style="s2">models you know I&#39;ve seen these graphs</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.410" end="00:11:53.979" style="s2">with all the whole series of climate</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.879" end="00:11:55.809" style="s2">models laid over each other how relevant</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.979" end="00:11:58.089" style="s2">are they what do they tell us what do</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.809" end="00:12:00.009" style="s2">they not tell us well</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.089" end="00:12:03.039" style="s2">climate models are very important tools</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.009" end="00:12:04.660" style="s2">for those of us studying the climate</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.039" end="00:12:07.660" style="s2">system both in terms of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.660" end="00:12:10.689" style="s2">understand mechanisms and also thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.660" end="00:12:11.980" style="s2">about forecasts for the future but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.689" end="00:12:14.589" style="s2">think it&#39;s really important to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.980" end="00:12:16.209" style="s2">understand that we&#39;re doing an</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.589" end="00:12:19.449" style="s2">experiment on the planet that hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.209" end="00:12:21.069" style="s2">been done ever in geologic history there</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.449" end="00:12:23.199" style="s2">are some analogs the best natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.069" end="00:12:26.439" style="s2">analogue we might talk about is about 55</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.199" end="00:12:27.999" style="s2">million years ago but it&#39;s it&#39;s a decent</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.439" end="00:12:30.519" style="s2">analogue but it&#39;s not a perfect analogue</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.999" end="00:12:33.009" style="s2">because it happened on a much longer</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.519" end="00:12:38.199" style="s2">time scale so the truth is that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.009" end="00:12:39.549" style="s2">really don&#39;t know a lot of things about</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.199" end="00:12:41.799" style="s2">the Earth&#39;s system and how it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.549" end="00:12:45.399" style="s2">respond to the kind of changes we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.799" end="00:12:47.709" style="s2">made to the atmosphere and so models are</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.399" end="00:12:49.929" style="s2">really important because the system is</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.709" end="00:12:52.329" style="s2">too complicated to just you know do a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.929" end="00:12:54.909" style="s2">calculation on on a blackboard and or a</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.329" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">piece of paper and and predict exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.909" end="00:12:57.489" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:13:00.359" style="s2">at the same time we have to always</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.489" end="00:13:03.459" style="s2">maintain a sense of skepticism and</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.359" end="00:13:04.689" style="s2">questions about the models because there</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.459" end="00:13:06.879" style="s2">are parts of the system we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.689" end="00:13:08.769" style="s2">understand that is you know they</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.879" end="00:13:11.230" style="s2">represent the best understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.769" end="00:13:13.869" style="s2">earth system but we&#39;re taking the earth</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.230" end="00:13:15.459" style="s2">system outside of any realm of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.869" end="00:13:17.470" style="s2">experience and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.459" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">the history of observations is only</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.470" end="00:13:21.339" style="s2">limited in its ability to predict the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.240" end="00:13:23.379" style="s2">future does that make sense absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.339" end="00:13:25.750" style="s2">and you know we both tend to think in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.379" end="00:13:27.850" style="s2">terms of complex systems and we do know</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.750" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">that the ability to predict complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.850" end="00:13:32.709" style="s2">systems out of ways under major</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:34.420" style="s2">perturbation is relatively limited best</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.709" end="00:13:37.120" style="s2">we can do is build various models and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.420" end="00:13:39.790" style="s2">maybe some sense we can&#39;t call our shots</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.120" end="00:13:41.170" style="s2">yeah although although again I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.790" end="00:13:44.139" style="s2">what&#39;s important for people to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.170" end="00:13:46.779" style="s2">understand is that for the basic physics</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.139" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">of this it&#39;s not that complex a system</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.779" end="00:13:52.930" style="s2">the basic physics of the greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:55.149" style="s2">effect and the basic physics of how the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.930" end="00:13:57.790" style="s2">system worked was known more than a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.149" end="00:13:59.649" style="s2">hundred years ago John Tyndall you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.790" end="00:14:01.509" style="s2">understood the basic physics of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.649" end="00:14:04.089" style="s2">greenhouse effect he did these elaborate</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.509" end="00:14:06.550" style="s2">experiments showing how carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.089" end="00:14:09.579" style="s2">would absorb infrared radiation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.550" end="00:14:11.230" style="s2">svante arrhenius basically you know he</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.579" end="00:14:13.750" style="s2">for those who you don&#39;t know who he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.230" end="00:14:16.269" style="s2">he was the first Nobel Prize winner in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.750" end="00:14:19.110" style="s2">chemistry from Sweden he was the first</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.269" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">Nobel Prize with laureate from Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.110" end="00:14:23.769" style="s2">he&#39;s considered one of the founders of</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:27.819" style="s2">physical chemistry and in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.769" end="00:14:30.310" style="s2">around 1903 1905 he was already writing</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.819" end="00:14:32.319" style="s2">about the greenhouse effect and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.310" end="00:14:35.319" style="s2">actually suggested that we would</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.319" end="00:14:37.569" style="s2">probably double carbon dioxide levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.319" end="00:14:39.579" style="s2">because of burning coal and that and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.569" end="00:14:42.459" style="s2">that he calculated the effect would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.579" end="00:14:44.410" style="s2">about 4 degrees Celsius so the basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.459" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">physics of the system was understood</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.410" end="00:14:49.509" style="s2">more than a hundred years ago this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:51.160" style="s2">not new science it&#39;s not unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.509" end="00:14:53.709" style="s2">complex yes the earth is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.160" end="00:14:56.829" style="s2">system and most of what we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.709" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">are things that could hurt us but but</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.829" end="00:15:01.809" style="s2">the basic physics of how the earth warms</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">is actually pretty understandable with</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.809" end="00:15:05.589" style="s2">relatively simple models that are not</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:08.649" style="s2">that complex and what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.589" end="00:15:09.970" style="s2">really is you know the basic idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.649" end="00:15:11.259" style="s2">radiative equilibrium so when you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.970" end="00:15:13.899" style="s2">increase greenhouse gases in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.259" end="00:15:16.509" style="s2">atmosphere we understand again going</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.899" end="00:15:18.250" style="s2">back to John Tyndall and spontaneous 100</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.509" end="00:15:19.750" style="s2">years ago we know that the Earth&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.250" end="00:15:22.600" style="s2">warm up and that&#39;s just because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.750" end="00:15:23.829" style="s2">increased essentially the absorption of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.600" end="00:15:25.870" style="s2">infrared coming off the surface</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.829" end="00:15:27.579" style="s2">essentially we&#39;ve increased the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.870" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">layer you could think of it as putting a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.579" end="00:15:30.850" style="s2">thermal blanket on the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.370" style="s2">result the surface temperatures gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.850" end="00:15:35.520" style="s2">heat up until the outgoing radiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.370" end="00:15:38.980" style="s2">balances the incoming solar radiation</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.520" end="00:15:41.770" style="s2">that&#39;s very simple what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.980" end="00:15:43.660" style="s2">complicated if the earth were completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.770" end="00:15:45.760" style="s2">covered with land climate change would</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.660" end="00:15:48.070" style="s2">be so much simpler because essentially</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.760" end="00:15:49.780" style="s2">it would very quickly warm up and would</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.070" end="00:15:50.620" style="s2">achieve that radiative equilibrium and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.780" end="00:15:52.870" style="s2">we&#39;d be all set</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.620" end="00:15:54.610" style="s2">but the fact that the ocean is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.870" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">that 70% of your surface is covered with</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.610" end="00:15:59.560" style="s2">water makes the earth much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:03.010" style="s2">interesting and complicated and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.560" end="00:16:03.820" style="s2">reason is that the ocean is this huge</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.010" end="00:16:05.800" style="s2">heat sink</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.820" end="00:16:08.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a giant tub of cold water think</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.800" end="00:16:12.280" style="s2">about what would happen you know in your</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.200" end="00:16:17.050" style="s2">bedroom if you had a giant bathtub that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.280" end="00:16:19.060" style="s2">covered 70% of your bedroom and was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.050" end="00:16:21.130" style="s2">big ice tub filled with ice water and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.060" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">now you turn up the thermostat so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.130" end="00:16:25.510" style="s2">can sleep there 270 degrees or 68</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">degrees or whatever and what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.510" end="00:16:29.380" style="s2">discover is it&#39;s still really cold in</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:32.380" style="s2">your room for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.380" end="00:16:34.210" style="s2">that&#39;s because the heat is going into</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.380" end="00:16:37.960" style="s2">warming the ice and and there&#39;s heat</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.210" end="00:16:39.850" style="s2">exchange and the ice bath is cooling the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.960" end="00:16:42.100" style="s2">room and you have to wait for that ice</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.850" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">bath to warm up before that you reach an</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.100" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">equilibrium temperature the same things</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:50.440" style="s2">happening with the earth so the ocean is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.270" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">absorbing heat and mixing it down and if</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.440" end="00:16:54.820" style="s2">you actually look at the pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:56.890" style="s2">warming the spatial pattern of warming</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.820" end="00:17:00.550" style="s2">you see that the continents have warmed</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.890" end="00:17:02.680" style="s2">about twice as much on average as the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.550" end="00:17:05.560" style="s2">oceans and that&#39;s because the oceans are</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.680" end="00:17:07.390" style="s2">actively sucking up heat and that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.560" end="00:17:11.260" style="s2">good news and bad news the good news is</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.390" end="00:17:14.410" style="s2">we haven&#39;t really had to experience the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.260" end="00:17:16.540" style="s2">full impact of our of our changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.410" end="00:17:20.470" style="s2">atmosphere that we&#39;ve made the bad news</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.540" end="00:17:22.800" style="s2">is that we&#39;re committed to probably at</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.470" end="00:17:25.930" style="s2">least 50% more and maybe more than that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.800" end="00:17:27.579" style="s2">maybe you know maybe 70% additional</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.930" end="00:17:29.890" style="s2">warming that we&#39;ve already experienced</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.579" end="00:17:31.960" style="s2">is still to come into the future so if</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.890" end="00:17:34.000" style="s2">we stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:36.940" style="s2">the earth is going to keep warming for</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.000" end="00:17:38.380" style="s2">centuries maybe even millennia that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.940" end="00:17:40.900" style="s2">little that&#39;s a little scary</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.380" end="00:17:42.220" style="s2">could you explain that I know it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.900" end="00:17:43.430" style="s2">true and I have gone through the math</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.220" end="00:17:45.470" style="s2">myself but</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.430" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">if you could explain how that thermal</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.470" end="00:17:49.670" style="s2">inertia works and it&#39;s plain that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:51.350" style="s2">languages you could well I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.670" end="00:17:53.090" style="s2">exactly the same as the example I gave</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.350" end="00:17:55.280" style="s2">with the bathtub in your bedroom</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:56.930" style="s2">essentially the oceans are a giant heat</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.280" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">sink so when you increase greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.930" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2">gasses in the atmosphere the earth wants</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">to achieve a certain temperature that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:04.900" style="s2">will achieve what&#39;s called radiative</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.170" end="00:18:08.450" style="s2">equilibrium that&#39;s when outgoing</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.900" end="00:18:11.060" style="s2">infrared radiation that is heat that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.450" end="00:18:12.740" style="s2">goes out to space is equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.060" end="00:18:14.600" style="s2">amount of energy coming in from solar</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.740" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">radiation so when you add greenhouse</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.600" end="00:18:18.730" style="s2">gases you create an imbalance you absorb</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:21.020" style="s2">more of the infrared radiation and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.730" end="00:18:23.750" style="s2">therefore the surface temperature has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.020" end="00:18:25.610" style="s2">rise to achieve a new equilibrium so</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.750" end="00:18:29.900" style="s2">that you&#39;re in balance again what comes</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.610" end="00:18:32.390" style="s2">in has to go out ninety percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.900" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">imbalance today is actually goes into</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.390" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">warming the oceans a few percent goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:39.140" style="s2">into warming the surface a few percent</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:42.620" style="s2">goes into warming the two melting ice</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.140" end="00:18:44.660" style="s2">but but 90% of the energy imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.620" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">because of the greenhouse gases we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.660" end="00:18:49.040" style="s2">added in the atmosphere goes into</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">heating the ocean so if you sort of say</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.040" end="00:18:52.520" style="s2">what is global warming the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:54.110" style="s2">global warming is really ocean warming</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.520" end="00:18:57.410" style="s2">that&#39;s where most of the energy is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.110" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">actually going and the time scale of</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.410" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">mixing of the oceans you know mixing all</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:03.350" style="s2">that cold water up and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:05.960" style="s2">warming the whole ocean or at least the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.350" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">whole upper half of the ocean the time</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.960" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">scales thousands of years and so until</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:14.900" style="s2">the ocean is in equilibrium with this</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:16.820" style="s2">new atmosphere essentially it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.900" end="00:19:19.010" style="s2">keep absorbing heat and keep warming and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.820" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna take more than a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.010" end="00:19:22.960" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">so we&#39;ve already committed the earth to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.960" end="00:19:27.470" style="s2">substantial additional warming that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:27.890" style="s2">haven&#39;t yet experienced does that make</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.470" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.890" end="00:19:31.490" style="s2">absolutely I&#39;ll play it back in as plain</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:34.580" style="s2">English as I can for our audience</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.490" end="00:19:36.740" style="s2">the ocean is storing energy and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.580" end="00:19:38.780" style="s2">result of that as it mixes thoroughly is</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.740" end="00:19:41.000" style="s2">that the average temperature the upper</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.780" end="00:19:44.240" style="s2">layers of the ocean will gradually rise</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.000" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">and then that warmer water sitting next</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.240" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">to the atmosphere will slowly raise the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:52.730" style="s2">temperature of the atmosphere that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:54.860" style="s2">right so so for example 20,000 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.730" end="00:19:56.330" style="s2">when the earth was about four or five</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.860" end="00:19:57.950" style="s2">degrees colder</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.330" end="00:20:00.200" style="s2">the deep ocean was about four degrees</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.950" end="00:20:01.730" style="s2">colder as well the deep ocean was very</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.200" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">close to the freezing point of seawater</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.730" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">which is about minus two degrees because</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:09.320" style="s2">of salt it&#39;s it&#39;s below zero Celsius so</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:11.420" style="s2">you know the ocean was much colder</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.320" end="00:20:12.860" style="s2">20,000 years ago and you could think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.420" end="00:20:15.800" style="s2">the fact that the ocean was sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.860" end="00:20:17.180" style="s2">in equilibrium with a colder climate by</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.800" end="00:20:19.100" style="s2">the way carbon dioxide levels were about</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.180" end="00:20:21.410" style="s2">a hundred and eighty parts per million</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.100" end="00:20:24.350" style="s2">back then that was one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.410" end="00:20:26.870" style="s2">why the earth was so cold so in the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.350" end="00:20:30.500" style="s2">10,000 years carbon dioxide has been</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.870" end="00:20:33.920" style="s2">between 260 and 280 parts per million</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.500" end="00:20:35.390" style="s2">and the atmosphere and ocean have</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.920" end="00:20:37.550" style="s2">equilibrate it to the point where the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.390" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">ocean is you know about one or two</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.550" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">degrees in the deep ocean in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:42.290" style="s2">Atlantic it&#39;s a little warmer it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:45.290" style="s2">3 or 4 degrees because it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.290" end="00:20:47.240" style="s2">saltier but but essentially that is in</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.290" end="00:20:48.620" style="s2">equilibrium with the modern atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.240" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">or with the with a pre-industrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.620" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">atmosphere now that we have added</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:57.080" style="s2">greenhouse gases the oceans are slowly</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:20:58.970" style="s2">warming and probably they will warm you</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.080" end="00:21:01.940" style="s2">know another three or four degrees and</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.970" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">we&#39;ve just started the heat uptake from</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.940" end="00:21:06.560" style="s2">the ocean is is happening steadily and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:08.360" style="s2">slowly and in fact it is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.560" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">major reasons why sea level is rising</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.360" end="00:21:12.650" style="s2">certainly ice melting is contributing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.150" style="s2">sea level rise but one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.650" end="00:21:16.280" style="s2">reasons for sea level rise is just</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.150" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">thermal expansion of seawater that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.280" end="00:21:20.600" style="s2">ocean warming very good very well stated</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">I think that will help our audience</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.600" end="00:21:25.370" style="s2">understand how important this ocean</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.330" end="00:21:27.770" style="s2">warming phenomena is both with respect</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.370" end="00:21:29.540" style="s2">to its long term inertial effects and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.770" end="00:21:31.700" style="s2">this is very important people to know</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.540" end="00:21:34.190" style="s2">most though of the sea level rise we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.700" end="00:21:35.900" style="s2">seen so far is just as Dan said the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.190" end="00:21:38.060" style="s2">water gets bigger when you heat it up</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.900" end="00:21:40.160" style="s2">another issue about the ocean which we</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.060" end="00:21:43.670" style="s2">hear talked about a lot is acidification</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.160" end="00:21:48.530" style="s2">of the ocean what&#39;s your take on that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.670" end="00:21:51.440" style="s2">I actually think acidification first of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.530" end="00:21:53.150" style="s2">all people have to understand the actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.440" end="00:21:56.060" style="s2">change in pH of the ocean is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.150" end="00:21:58.160" style="s2">pretty subtle first of all the ocean is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.060" end="00:22:01.730" style="s2">slightly basic the pH of seawater is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.160" end="00:22:03.590" style="s2">about 8.2 or 8.3 the deep ocean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.730" end="00:22:07.090" style="s2">little bit less than that because of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.590" end="00:22:09.830" style="s2">biological pump that actually takes</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.090" end="00:22:12.590" style="s2">biological productivity</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.830" end="00:22:14.840" style="s2">algae bacteria Falls to the deep ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.590" end="00:22:16.149" style="s2">it gets respired by so plankton they eat</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.840" end="00:22:18.769" style="s2">it and turn it back into carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.149" end="00:22:21.049" style="s2">which slightly acidifies the deep ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.769" end="00:22:23.390" style="s2">so the deep ocean is a little little</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.049" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">lower pH than the surface ocean but both</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.390" end="00:22:29.690" style="s2">are more basic than neutral right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:31.399" style="s2">they are both well above 7 ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:34.399" style="s2">acidification really has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.399" end="00:22:36.850" style="s2">timescale of the carbon cycle we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.399" end="00:22:39.529" style="s2">adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.850" end="00:22:41.419" style="s2">more quickly than the ocean can absorb</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.529" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">it and the reason is because the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.419" end="00:22:45.679" style="s2">only mixes so fast if we could mix the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:48.679" style="s2">oceans instantly if we had a giant</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.679" end="00:22:51.830" style="s2">mixing rod that would mix the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.679" end="00:22:53.510" style="s2">very quickly 80 to 90 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.830" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">carbon dioxide we&#39;ve added to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.510" end="00:22:58.250" style="s2">atmosphere would go into the ocean so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.799" style="s2">the long run you could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.250" end="00:23:03.769" style="s2">solution or at least 80 to 90% of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:05.809" style="s2">solution to pollution is solution that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.769" end="00:23:09.289" style="s2">is the oceans gonna take care of our</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.809" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">problem the difficulty is the time scale</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.289" end="00:23:15.260" style="s2">for that ocean uptake is probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:17.809" style="s2">several thousand years and so 80% of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.260" end="00:23:21.500" style="s2">co2 is likely to go away but only over</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.809" end="00:23:23.419" style="s2">the next next several thousand years and</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.500" end="00:23:24.950" style="s2">therefore we have to still live in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.419" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">next few centuries and so we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.950" end="00:23:30.260" style="s2">problem because of that disequilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:32.389" style="s2">because co2 is going higher in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.260" end="00:23:34.580" style="s2">atmosphere and the ocean isn&#39;t taking it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.389" end="00:23:36.830" style="s2">up fast enough the surface ocean which</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.580" end="00:23:38.600" style="s2">mixes and equilibrates with this</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.830" end="00:23:41.389" style="s2">atmosphere relatively quickly that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.600" end="00:23:44.450" style="s2">the upper 100 or 200 meters of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.389" end="00:23:47.090" style="s2">is actually seeing higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.450" end="00:23:50.120" style="s2">carbon dioxide and it&#39;s pH is dropping a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.090" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">little bit like a tenth or two tenths of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.120" end="00:23:55.789" style="s2">a pH unit so it turns out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:58.250" style="s2">actually a pretty subtle effect what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.789" end="00:24:00.769" style="s2">tends to do is make it slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.250" end="00:24:02.659" style="s2">difficult for organisms that make their</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.769" end="00:24:04.429" style="s2">shells out of calcium carbonate and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.659" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about corals</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.429" end="00:24:08.809" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about clams and other</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:11.630" style="s2">mollusks we&#39;re talking about algae</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.809" end="00:24:13.010" style="s2">called Kaka Litha fors they grow their</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.630" end="00:24:15.230" style="s2">shells out of calcium carbonate that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.010" end="00:24:18.830" style="s2">then fall on the ocean floor and form</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.230" end="00:24:21.470" style="s2">limestone or chalk and this the slight</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.830" end="00:24:22.810" style="s2">change in pH of seawater can affect the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.470" end="00:24:26.050" style="s2">ecology of those organisms</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.810" end="00:24:27.790" style="s2">now it sounds very scary and some people</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.050" end="00:24:29.290" style="s2">say oh oh should acidification it makes</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.790" end="00:24:30.970" style="s2">it sound like the whole ocean is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.290" end="00:24:35.290" style="s2">turn into acid and everything&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.970" end="00:24:37.690" style="s2">die that is really not true in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.290" end="00:24:40.390" style="s2">would say that the total effects of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.690" end="00:24:43.270" style="s2">ocean acidification on the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.390" end="00:24:45.400" style="s2">the ocean right now are still mostly</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.270" end="00:24:48.010" style="s2">unknown I don&#39;t even know in what</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.400" end="00:24:49.810" style="s2">direction they&#39;re gonna go certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.010" end="00:24:52.900" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna probably hurt coral reefs</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.810" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">and favor organisms that don&#39;t grow</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.900" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">their shells out of calcium carbonate</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">but I would say this first of all by far</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:03.190" style="s2">the biggest impact on the ecology of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.940" end="00:25:05.970" style="s2">oceans that we&#39;ve experienced so far is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.190" end="00:25:09.070" style="s2">overfishing you know we have basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.970" end="00:25:11.440" style="s2">ruined the marine ecosystem just by</p>

<p begin="00:25:21.880" end="00:25:26.230" style="s2">itself and the warming of the surface</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.260" end="00:25:28.630" style="s2">ocean is profoundly changing the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.230" end="00:25:31.660" style="s2">ecosystem and that probably is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.630" end="00:25:34.900" style="s2">have a much bigger effect on ocean</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.660" end="00:25:36.250" style="s2">ecology than the acidification so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.900" end="00:25:36.970" style="s2">not that ocean acidification is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.250" end="00:25:38.980" style="s2">non-issue</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.970" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2">I just think it&#39;s really a minor issue</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.980" end="00:25:45.630" style="s2">relative to warming of seawater and also</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:48.520" style="s2">the impact of overfishing</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.630" end="00:25:50.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve just devastated when overfishing</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.520" end="00:25:52.930" style="s2">includes by the way the trawling of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.470" end="00:25:54.850" style="s2">oceans you know that most of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.930" end="00:25:55.960" style="s2">continental shelf that is the shallower</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.450" end="00:26:03.070" style="s2">just completely destroyed it like like</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.760" end="00:26:05.230" style="s2">dragging a heavy rake over you know it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.070" end="00:26:07.570" style="s2">essentially looks like pavement now</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.570" end="00:26:10.660" style="s2">horrible well thanks for putting all</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.280" end="00:26:13.720" style="s2">that into perspective I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.660" end="00:26:15.670" style="s2">very useful what about the data how good</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:18.370" style="s2">is our data about the actual levels of</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.670" end="00:26:21.010" style="s2">climate increase and how does the data</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.370" end="00:26:23.410" style="s2">that&#39;s been collected and clean compared</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.010" end="00:26:26.920" style="s2">to what we&#39;ve seen in the models so I</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:29.470" style="s2">would say that in general our observing</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.920" end="00:26:31.570" style="s2">system of the earth is I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.470" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">a half-empty half-full kind of problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.570" end="00:26:35.570" style="s2">the answer is there are some great</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:37.610" style="s2">successes especially</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.570" end="00:26:39.050" style="s2">recently there are also some places</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.610" end="00:26:42.050" style="s2">where we could do a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.050" end="00:26:45.460" style="s2">there are certainly parts of our Earth</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.050" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">observing system we&#39;d love to have more</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.460" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">carefully calibrated data one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">challenges with certain types of climate</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:57.680" style="s2">data is that it could be spatially</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:00.770" style="s2">variable so think of the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.680" end="00:27:03.110" style="s2">recording precipitation you know we know</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.770" end="00:27:06.050" style="s2">this from Santa Fe you know you can be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.110" end="00:27:08.690" style="s2">in New Mexico and there can be rain in</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.050" end="00:27:11.450" style="s2">one place and no rain and you know three</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.690" end="00:27:14.270" style="s2">miles away it&#39;s highly spatially</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.450" end="00:27:15.890" style="s2">variable so actually recording average</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.270" end="00:27:17.750" style="s2">precipitation rates is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.890" end="00:27:20.630" style="s2">complicated and if you want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.750" end="00:27:21.770" style="s2">globally including in places where they</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.630" end="00:27:23.930" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.770" end="00:27:26.330" style="s2">infrastructure that we have in the US it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.930" end="00:27:28.040" style="s2">gets really complicated so for example</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.330" end="00:27:30.170" style="s2">most of the studies of what the impact</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.040" end="00:27:31.820" style="s2">of climate change on agriculture is</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.170" end="00:27:33.410" style="s2">going to be is from the US because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.820" end="00:27:37.190" style="s2">that&#39;s where the good data are or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.410" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">sometimes from the U we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.190" end="00:27:42.890" style="s2">have very good data from Africa or</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:45.500" style="s2">certain parts of Siberia or Latin</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.890" end="00:27:47.780" style="s2">America and that&#39;s and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.500" end="00:27:50.270" style="s2">just because the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.780" end="00:27:53.150" style="s2">observations is too low the satellite</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.270" end="00:27:54.920" style="s2">era has helped in some respects but in</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.150" end="00:27:56.800" style="s2">some cases there really is no substitute</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.920" end="00:27:59.210" style="s2">for good ground-based observations</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.800" end="00:28:01.850" style="s2">another problem with climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.210" end="00:28:04.430" style="s2">that observing systems change over time</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.850" end="00:28:06.950" style="s2">a classic example of this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.430" end="00:28:09.130" style="s2">measurements of ocean temperature there</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.950" end="00:28:12.740" style="s2">are scientists who still argue over</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.130" end="00:28:15.260" style="s2">correcting you know back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.740" end="00:28:17.840" style="s2">there used to be buckets that people</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.260" end="00:28:20.930" style="s2">would use on ships they would use cloth</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.840" end="00:28:24.050" style="s2">bags to take seawater and then measure</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.930" end="00:28:26.690" style="s2">the temperature and merchant ships would</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.050" end="00:28:28.670" style="s2">actually do this and then they used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.690" end="00:28:31.310" style="s2">switch from cloth buckets to metal</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.670" end="00:28:33.320" style="s2">buckets or wooden buckets and then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.310" end="00:28:34.910" style="s2">actually switch today most ocean</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.320" end="00:28:37.730" style="s2">measurements are made on merchant ships</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.910" end="00:28:39.710" style="s2">using an engine intake system and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.730" end="00:28:42.110" style="s2">turns out that every time you change the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.710" end="00:28:45.230" style="s2">measurement system they&#39;re actually some</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.110" end="00:28:47.040" style="s2">systematic and subtle changes in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.230" end="00:28:49.260" style="s2">temperature that you measure and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.040" end="00:28:50.700" style="s2">have to correct for these errors and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.260" end="00:28:52.560" style="s2">problem with climate change is you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.700" end="00:28:54.510" style="s2">absolute calibration with very high</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.560" end="00:28:56.340" style="s2">precision and that&#39;s a very big problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.510" end="00:28:58.830" style="s2">so when you change the measurement</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.340" end="00:29:00.900" style="s2">system you kind of have to think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.830" end="00:29:02.160" style="s2">the calibration problem and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.900" end="00:29:04.470" style="s2">always been a problem for earth</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.160" end="00:29:06.510" style="s2">observations let&#39;s talk about some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.470" end="00:29:10.110" style="s2">the good news though the good news is</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.510" end="00:29:12.510" style="s2">that you know 20 years ago most of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.110" end="00:29:14.340" style="s2">observations say of the ocean warming</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.510" end="00:29:16.140" style="s2">which is we said is you know that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.340" end="00:29:17.580" style="s2">global warming is ocean warming ninety</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.140" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">percent of the energy is going into the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.580" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">warming the ocean most of that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:24.540" style="s2">information in fact all of it really</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:28.470" style="s2">came from a bunch of cruises where</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.540" end="00:29:31.860" style="s2">oceanographers would go out and tow a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.470" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">wire drop a wire over the side with a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.860" end="00:29:38.790" style="s2">thermometer and basically measure the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:40.650" style="s2">temperature with depth and then come up</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.790" end="00:29:42.780" style="s2">and you know and and they would do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:44.490" style="s2">transect at some point in the year and</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.780" end="00:29:46.920" style="s2">then some other crews would go out and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.490" end="00:29:50.490" style="s2">do another one and that&#39;s how we knew</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.920" end="00:29:52.710" style="s2">about the ocean so it was kind of kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.490" end="00:29:54.870" style="s2">of awful there was a great quote from</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.710" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">Hanks Tom Hanks Tama was a famous</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.420" end="00:30:28.290" style="s2">studied the oceans they went out on</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.950" end="00:30:29.820" style="s2">ships and they dropped wires and</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.290" end="00:30:33.030" style="s2">measured what was down there they</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.820" end="00:30:35.250" style="s2">couldn&#39;t see and you know they would go</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.030" end="00:30:36.360" style="s2">out randomly on ships and measure and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.250" end="00:30:38.130" style="s2">they&#39;re parts of the ocean that just</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.360" end="00:30:41.280" style="s2">weren&#39;t measured and you certainly</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.540" end="00:30:48.570" style="s2">continuous measurements but they were</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:47.890" style="s2">every 10 centimeters and that takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:49.480" style="s2">about six hours and when they get to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.890" end="00:31:52.120" style="s2">surface they beam the data back down</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.480" end="00:31:53.710" style="s2">back to a back to a satellite and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.120" end="00:31:56.200" style="s2">they sink back down to a thousand meters</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.710" end="00:31:58.060" style="s2">and sit there again for nine days and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.200" end="00:32:00.070" style="s2">these are automated floats that have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.060" end="00:32:02.470" style="s2">lifetime of about five or six years and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.070" end="00:32:05.560" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of incredible there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.470" end="00:32:07.210" style="s2">currently something like 4,000 floats</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.560" end="00:32:09.070" style="s2">out there around the world oceans and</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.210" end="00:32:11.980" style="s2">what&#39;s amazing is there&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.070" end="00:32:13.390" style="s2">30 nations that have all contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.980" end="00:32:16.150" style="s2">this program this is an international</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.390" end="00:32:18.730" style="s2">partnership for earth observations that</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.150" end="00:32:22.570" style="s2">has been extraordinarily successful so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.730" end="00:32:24.220" style="s2">in in just a few years we had collected</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.570" end="00:32:26.560" style="s2">more data on the temperature and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.220" end="00:32:29.010" style="s2">salinity of the ocean then in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.560" end="00:32:32.020" style="s2">previous hundred years of Oceanography</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.010" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s a revolution in Earth</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.020" end="00:32:36.430" style="s2">observing systems where that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:39.010" style="s2">really interesting it&#39;s amazing and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.430" end="00:32:41.650" style="s2">we have data now over the last about 15</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.010" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">years for and we can actually measure</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.650" end="00:32:45.640" style="s2">the ocean warming so now it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:47.530" style="s2">speculation whether the ocean is warming</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.640" end="00:32:49.450" style="s2">we measure ocean warming and if you sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.530" end="00:32:51.040" style="s2">of say do we know if global warming is</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.450" end="00:32:52.840" style="s2">happening the answer is yes because if</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.040" end="00:32:55.000" style="s2">we can measure ocean warming that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.840" end="00:32:57.430" style="s2">where 90% of the energy is going that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.000" end="00:32:59.110" style="s2">absolutely proves what&#39;s actually going</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.430" end="00:33:02.170" style="s2">on in terms of the radiative imbalance</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.110" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s really fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.170" end="00:33:06.730" style="s2">important so that&#39;s a great success of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:11.890" style="s2">Earth observations in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.730" end="00:33:13.350" style="s2">models the answer is the models are good</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.890" end="00:33:17.280" style="s2">but not perfect there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.350" end="00:33:19.590" style="s2">a lot of details of the real world that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.280" end="00:33:22.020" style="s2">they don&#39;t have some of which I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.590" end="00:33:24.210" style="s2">are important for a sort of intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.020" end="00:33:26.070" style="s2">time scale forecasts I&#39;ll give you an</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.210" end="00:33:28.200" style="s2">example one of the things the model</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.070" end="00:33:30.809" style="s2">climate models don&#39;t do very well is</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.200" end="00:33:33.419" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually simulate the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.809" end="00:33:36.539" style="s2">decade to decade variability that we see</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.419" end="00:33:38.190" style="s2">in the real system and many of us think</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.539" end="00:33:40.230" style="s2">that the reason for that is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.190" end="00:33:42.600" style="s2">resolution of the models just isn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.230" end="00:33:45.630" style="s2">enough they&#39;re not actually simulating</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.600" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">the mixing the eddies the complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.630" end="00:33:50.850" style="s2">the turbulent flow in the oceans because</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:53.340" style="s2">they&#39;re the grid spacing is just too big</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.850" end="00:33:55.470" style="s2">and so it smears it all out and so the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.340" end="00:33:56.760" style="s2">result of that is they don&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.470" end="00:33:59.190" style="s2">of the physics in it that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.760" end="00:34:01.440" style="s2">that produce some of the decade to</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.190" end="00:34:03.929" style="s2">decade variability and therefore that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.440" end="00:34:05.309" style="s2">limits their skill in predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.929" end="00:34:07.830" style="s2">future at least on intermediate</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.309" end="00:34:10.520" style="s2">timescales that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.830" end="00:34:13.770" style="s2">wrong altogether it means that you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.520" end="00:34:15.840" style="s2">if you say how well our climate</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.770" end="00:34:17.609" style="s2">forecasts of you know what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.840" end="00:34:20.340" style="s2">temperature&#39;s going to be in 2040 or</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.609" end="00:34:22.740" style="s2">2050 the answer is there&#39;s a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.340" end="00:34:24.629" style="s2">of uncertainty because of the decade a</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.740" end="00:34:26.369" style="s2">decade variability that we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.629" end="00:34:29.369" style="s2">real system and we know the models don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.369" end="00:34:31.619" style="s2">do that very well that being said if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.369" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">go further out they actually probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.619" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">have more skill because the overall</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:38.520" style="s2">temperature rise is greater and I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:40.050" style="s2">the most important thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.520" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">is the biggest uncertainty in all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.050" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">this is actually what humans are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.139" style="s2">do you know we don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:47.850" style="s2">greenhouse gas we&#39;re gonna put into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.139" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">atmosphere over the next hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.850" end="00:34:53.010" style="s2">and so by far the biggest uncertainty in</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:55.050" style="s2">climate forecasts is actually the human</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.010" end="00:34:57.030" style="s2">part of the system we&#39;ll get to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.050" end="00:34:59.580" style="s2">later but yeah thankfully now the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.030" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">line does the last 15 years of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.580" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">system was an Argo did you say it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.430" style="s2">Argo yeah what does it show about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.020" style="s2">data the last 15 years well it shows</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.430" end="00:35:09.840" style="s2">that the earth is that the oceans are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.020" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">warming and it&#39;s warming at about the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.840" end="00:35:13.619" style="s2">rate that people are predicting the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:16.050" style="s2">error bars will continue to go down as</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.619" end="00:35:18.119" style="s2">we get longer time series so right now</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.050" end="00:35:21.930" style="s2">we only have you know about 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.119" end="00:35:24.030" style="s2">we&#39;d like to have more but you know in</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.930" end="00:35:25.710" style="s2">general it&#39;s mostly consistent with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.030" end="00:35:26.599" style="s2">models and the models are slowly</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.710" end="00:35:27.920" style="s2">converging</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.599" end="00:35:30.019" style="s2">you know it used to be that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.920" end="00:35:33.440" style="s2">big argument among climate models this</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.019" end="00:35:35.390" style="s2">goes back to the early 80s the early</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.440" end="00:35:37.700" style="s2">days of climate models in the 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.390" end="00:35:40.130" style="s2">80s in the u.s. there were two main</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.700" end="00:35:42.769" style="s2">groups one was a gist net which is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.130" end="00:35:44.890" style="s2">NASA lab in New York and the other was a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.769" end="00:35:47.749" style="s2">GFDL which is at Princeton New Jersey</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.890" end="00:35:50.059" style="s2">and a NOAA lab national ocean atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.749" end="00:35:52.220" style="s2">administration and there was the NOAA</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.059" end="00:35:55.160" style="s2">work was pioneered by a scientist named</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.220" end="00:35:57.109" style="s2">Sookie Manabi great climate scientist</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.160" end="00:36:00.769" style="s2">who pioneered development of climate</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.109" end="00:36:02.599" style="s2">models and the work at guess was led by</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.769" end="00:36:05.710" style="s2">a guy named Jim Hanson who is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.599" end="00:36:08.900" style="s2">heroes and climate change gave a famous</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.710" end="00:36:10.849" style="s2">testimony to the Senate in 1988 that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.900" end="00:36:13.970" style="s2">changed a lot of people&#39;s thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.849" end="00:36:16.430" style="s2">climate change anyway Jim Hansen&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.970" end="00:36:18.789" style="s2">and Souki manami&#39;s model they both did</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.430" end="00:36:22.190" style="s2">runs with doubling of carbon dioxide and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.789" end="00:36:23.809" style="s2">they got different answers I think Sukie</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.190" end="00:36:26.569" style="s2">minami&#39;s model got two degrees Celsius</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.809" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">and Jim Hansen&#39;s model got four degrees</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.569" end="00:36:29.839" style="s2">Celsius I think that&#39;s right I could</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:32.150" style="s2">have gotten it backwards but I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.839" end="00:36:33.109" style="s2">pretty sure that&#39;s the right order it</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.150" end="00:36:35.089" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.109" end="00:36:39.380" style="s2">one got two degrees the other got four</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.089" end="00:36:41.869" style="s2">degrees and so a famous scientist at MIT</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.380" end="00:36:43.910" style="s2">named Jules Charney said that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.869" end="00:36:46.249" style="s2">climate sensitivity which we just</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.910" end="00:36:48.259" style="s2">thought defined as how the earth</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.249" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">responds to a doubling of carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.259" end="00:36:53.269" style="s2">levels was about 3 plus or minus one and</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:55.849" style="s2">a half degrees you know there was he</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.269" end="00:36:57.349" style="s2">just split the two numbers and said okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.849" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">the number is three because you got two</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.349" end="00:37:01.549" style="s2">one one group got to the other got four</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:03.469" style="s2">so the right number is three obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.549" end="00:37:05.569" style="s2">that sounds a little arbitrary and there</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.469" end="00:37:07.279" style="s2">was a big discussion about is it one or</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.569" end="00:37:10.069" style="s2">two degrees or is it three or four</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.279" end="00:37:12.769" style="s2">degrees and the answer matters right if</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.069" end="00:37:15.049" style="s2">if if doubling of carbon dioxide level</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.769" end="00:37:17.390" style="s2">which seems inevitable soon after a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.049" end="00:37:19.339" style="s2">mid-century for the earth well</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.390" end="00:37:20.989" style="s2">guaranteed to get there the question is</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.339" end="00:37:24.140" style="s2">how much higher will go in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.989" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">carbon dioxide levels but but doubling</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.140" end="00:37:28.670" style="s2">of co2 if that actually produces three</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.589" style="s2">to four degrees of warming instead of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.670" end="00:37:32.420" style="s2">one to two degrees of warming that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.589" end="00:37:33.530" style="s2">really big deal we need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.420" end="00:37:35.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.530" end="00:37:38.360" style="s2">and what was interesting was most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.720" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">climate models when they were compared</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.360" end="00:37:42.950" style="s2">against recent data over the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:44.960" style="s2">century suggested that the number was</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.950" end="00:37:49.100" style="s2">small was probably closer to two degrees</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.960" end="00:37:51.500" style="s2">and the interesting than was those of us</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.100" end="00:37:53.660" style="s2">those of us who studied the Paleo</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.500" end="00:37:55.700" style="s2">climate system the last ice age</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.660" end="00:37:58.730" style="s2">were the ancient climates of the Eocene</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.700" end="00:38:01.400" style="s2">fifty million years ago we realized that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.730" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">in fact if it was only two degrees per</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.400" end="00:38:06.200" style="s2">doubling of co2 you actually couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:08.630" style="s2">explain the changes in climate we&#39;d seen</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.200" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">in the geologic past we had a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.630" end="00:38:12.680" style="s2">good idea of how much carbon dioxide</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:14.990" style="s2">levels changed and you couldn&#39;t explain</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.680" end="00:38:17.300" style="s2">that with just two degrees per doubling</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.990" end="00:38:19.400" style="s2">of co2 you needed something more like</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.300" end="00:38:21.230" style="s2">four degrees and so there was this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.400" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">argument about was it two degrees or was</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.230" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">it four degrees most of that has gone</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:29.240" style="s2">away and here&#39;s the simple resolution</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:31.250" style="s2">and again has to do with time scale it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.240" end="00:38:33.220" style="s2">really interesting the time scale of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.250" end="00:38:35.960" style="s2">warming and the time scale of the oceans</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.220" end="00:38:37.940" style="s2">the models when they compare to 20th</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.960" end="00:38:40.310" style="s2">century data they&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.940" end="00:38:42.080" style="s2">short time scale they&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.310" end="00:38:47.180" style="s2">immediate response of the earth system</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.080" end="00:38:49.850" style="s2">and again if a substantial fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.180" end="00:38:52.220" style="s2">the warming is not yet happened because</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.850" end="00:38:55.130" style="s2">of ocean warming and the timescale of</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.220" end="00:38:59.540" style="s2">ocean mixing that actually reconciles</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.130" end="00:39:03.350" style="s2">the two perspectives so the climate</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.540" end="00:39:05.150" style="s2">sensitivity of the models due to you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.350" end="00:39:07.640" style="s2">know a doubling of co2 on the short</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.150" end="00:39:10.910" style="s2">timescale is probably closer to two</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.640" end="00:39:12.500" style="s2">degrees Celsius per doubling but if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.910" end="00:39:13.970" style="s2">wait for the oceans to warm</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.500" end="00:39:16.190" style="s2">then it gets closer to three or four</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.970" end="00:39:17.510" style="s2">degrees and that&#39;s where the how</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.190" end="00:39:21.590" style="s2">everything is sort of come into</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.510" end="00:39:23.030" style="s2">agreement I know that&#39;s a bit of a long</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.590" end="00:39:24.890" style="s2">tangent but I think that&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.030" end="00:39:26.450" style="s2">understand yeah that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.890" end="00:39:28.750" style="s2">just you know a lot of the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.450" end="00:39:31.670" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about policy focuses on like</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.750" end="00:39:33.260" style="s2">2100 but it is important and it we</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.670" end="00:39:35.870" style="s2">absolutely have to do something before</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.260" end="00:39:37.190" style="s2">2100 and a lot but it&#39;s also important</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.870" end="00:39:39.260" style="s2">to realize that we&#39;ve pulled the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.190" end="00:39:42.440" style="s2">slingshot way back and it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.260" end="00:39:44.900" style="s2">impacting 2,200 2,300 and 2,400</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.440" end="00:39:46.220" style="s2">so hopefully we&#39;ll have techno fixes by</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.900" end="00:39:47.120" style="s2">that point which we&#39;ll talk about here</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.220" end="00:39:48.920" style="s2">in a minute well</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.120" end="00:39:51.320" style="s2">I would I would I would caution you Jim</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.920" end="00:39:53.150" style="s2">first of all the last thing you should</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.320" end="00:39:55.490" style="s2">ever do and please don&#39;t ever do this</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.150" end="00:39:58.550" style="s2">again is to call geoengineering a techno</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.490" end="00:40:02.030" style="s2">fix because it&#39;s not it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.550" end="00:40:04.070" style="s2">not a techno fix I would purge that word</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.030" end="00:40:05.300" style="s2">from your vocabulary with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.070" end="00:40:07.610" style="s2">climate change because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.300" end="00:40:09.530" style="s2">techno fix the thing that people need to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.610" end="00:40:12.470" style="s2">understand is the timescale of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.530" end="00:40:16.370" style="s2">systems is really long and this gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.470" end="00:40:18.080" style="s2">into this question of human response we</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.370" end="00:40:19.670" style="s2">see this all the time and I know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.080" end="00:40:21.170" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk about politics I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.670" end="00:40:22.820" style="s2">not going to talk about politics per se</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.170" end="00:40:25.370" style="s2">but I will say that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.820" end="00:40:27.140" style="s2">rhetoric from environmental groups and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.370" end="00:40:29.330" style="s2">from political candidates who want to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.140" end="00:40:30.620" style="s2">something about climate change they</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.330" end="00:40:32.090" style="s2">struggle with this because they know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.620" end="00:40:33.800" style="s2">that people who care about climate</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.090" end="00:40:37.160" style="s2">change want them to fix it right away</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.800" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">and the problem with climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.160" end="00:40:41.210" style="s2">it&#39;s a long time scale problem and it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:44.780" style="s2">can&#39;t be fixed overnight</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.210" end="00:40:47.120" style="s2">you can&#39;t decarbonize the u.s. in ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.780" end="00:40:48.650" style="s2">years and even if you could it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.120" end="00:40:51.500" style="s2">solve the problem because it&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.650" end="00:40:53.960" style="s2">collective action problem and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.500" end="00:40:56.870" style="s2">decarbonize the whole world in ten years</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.960" end="00:40:59.900" style="s2">and even if you did that again the time</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.870" end="00:41:03.140" style="s2">scale for the earth to keep warming is</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.900" end="00:41:06.080" style="s2">still millennia and so you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.140" end="00:41:07.880" style="s2">not gonna fix this problem quickly it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.080" end="00:41:09.710" style="s2">just is not possible and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.880" end="00:41:11.720" style="s2">really really important to understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.710" end="00:41:12.950" style="s2">let me give you a perspective on this we</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.720" end="00:41:16.310" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about the ice sheets yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.950" end="00:41:20.360" style="s2">but the ice sheets have anis terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.310" end="00:41:23.750" style="s2">long time scale I think people maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.360" end="00:41:25.580" style="s2">understand a little bit intuitively how</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.750" end="00:41:28.220" style="s2">big the ice sheets are but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.580" end="00:41:30.350" style="s2">give people an example of just how large</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.220" end="00:41:33.110" style="s2">they are so Greenland is the smaller of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.350" end="00:41:34.940" style="s2">the two polar ice sheets Greenland is</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.110" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">not really polar it&#39;s it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.940" end="00:41:40.490" style="s2">temperate Antarctica is much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:43.280" style="s2">so if Greenland melted completely sea</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.490" end="00:41:47.630" style="s2">level on average would rise about 7.2</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.280" end="00:41:50.600" style="s2">meters right or about 23 feet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.630" end="00:41:54.620" style="s2">tiny compared to Antarctica which is 50</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.600" end="00:41:55.850" style="s2">or 60 meters of sea level equivalent but</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.620" end="00:41:59.420" style="s2">what I think people don&#39;t understand is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.850" end="00:42:00.180" style="s2">just how big that really is so you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.420" end="00:42:03.930" style="s2">Greenland</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.180" end="00:42:07.380" style="s2">so big it actually has its own tidal</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.930" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">force if people never heard this but</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.380" end="00:42:13.079" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting so let&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:15.300" style="s2">you melted suppose we waved a magic wand</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.079" end="00:42:18.839" style="s2">and we melted a seventh of Greenland</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.300" end="00:42:21.300" style="s2">okay so you melt us at seventh of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.839" end="00:42:26.099" style="s2">Greenland and on average sea level rises</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.300" end="00:42:29.579" style="s2">by one meter okay but that&#39;s a global</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.099" end="00:42:30.839" style="s2">average it turns out that if you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.579" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">standing in the southern tip of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.839" end="00:42:37.319" style="s2">Greenland you would see sea level fall</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:40.410" style="s2">about 19 meters that&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.319" end="00:42:42.059" style="s2">strange do you know why that is no tell</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.410" end="00:42:45.480" style="s2">us that sounds very interesting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.059" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">because of the gravitational pull of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.480" end="00:42:49.890" style="s2">mass of the Greenland ice sheet that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">just like the moon pulling the water</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.890" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">around which is what causes the cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:58.530" style="s2">tides that we&#39;re used to the Greenland</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:43:01.319" style="s2">ice sheet it&#39;s so massive that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.530" end="00:43:02.880" style="s2">actually pulling seawater towards it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.319" end="00:43:06.210" style="s2">when you lose a seventh of Greenland you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.880" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">lose so much mass that the sea level</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.210" end="00:43:10.230" style="s2">locally recedes because it&#39;s got reduced</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.540" style="s2">gravitational attraction</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.230" end="00:43:15.420" style="s2">even though on average sea levels rising</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.540" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">one meter it&#39;s falling by 19 meters</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.420" end="00:43:19.890" style="s2">right next to Greenland is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:21.930" style="s2">incredible that is wow that&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.890" end="00:43:24.450" style="s2">thing that&#39;s worth knowing but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.930" end="00:43:27.349" style="s2">interesting part of that is if you think</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:30.690" style="s2">we can actually physically control</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.349" end="00:43:32.670" style="s2">something as big as the Greenland ice</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.690" end="00:43:35.400" style="s2">sheet I think you should think again</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.670" end="00:43:37.470" style="s2">this is a very big engineering challenge</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.400" end="00:43:40.349" style="s2">and by the way Greenland is tiny</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.470" end="00:43:42.210" style="s2">compared to Antarctica and and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.349" end="00:43:45.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a big difference between the two</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.210" end="00:43:49.650" style="s2">high sheets the cause of mass loss from</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.990" end="00:43:53.280" style="s2">Greenland is mostly and the risk for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.650" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">future is mostly due to summer melting</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.280" end="00:44:00.059" style="s2">so every summer Greenland melts on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:02.309" style="s2">periphery sometimes in 2012 it melted</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.059" end="00:44:04.710" style="s2">just about everywhere on Greenland but</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.309" end="00:44:07.170" style="s2">but most years it only melts in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.710" end="00:44:09.930" style="s2">perimeter of the ice sheet and then in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.170" end="00:44:12.930" style="s2">the winter more snow falls and the net</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.930" end="00:44:14.040" style="s2">today is negative that is it&#39;s losing</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.930" end="00:44:17.880" style="s2">mass</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.040" end="00:44:19.560" style="s2">if contributing something like a little</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.880" end="00:44:21.750" style="s2">more than half a millimeter a year close</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.560" end="00:44:23.880" style="s2">to probably somewhere between 1/2 and 1</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.750" end="00:44:26.580" style="s2">millimeter years something like point 8</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.880" end="00:44:28.020" style="s2">millimeters per year based on data we</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.580" end="00:44:29.520" style="s2">have from a satellite that measures the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.020" end="00:44:32.490" style="s2">gravitational field of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:35.150" style="s2">so 0.8 millimeters per year that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:37.530" style="s2">that much right think about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.150" end="00:44:39.770" style="s2">that&#39;s point 8 millimeters a year is</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.530" end="00:44:44.370" style="s2">like 8 centimeters over a century that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.770" end="00:44:46.530" style="s2">doesn&#39;t sound so terrifying the problem</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.370" end="00:44:49.500" style="s2">is we&#39;ve seen very dramatic changes in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.530" end="00:44:51.180" style="s2">the last 10 or 20 years and so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.500" end="00:44:53.520" style="s2">concern is this could dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.180" end="00:44:57.990" style="s2">accelerate and the risk is much more</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.520" end="00:45:00.150" style="s2">intense summer melting in Greenland and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.990" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">Antarctica it&#39;s melting more slowly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.150" end="00:45:04.290" style="s2">less it&#39;s probably closer to a half a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:06.300" style="s2">millimeter a year of mass loss but</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.290" end="00:45:07.970" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about Antarctica is</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.300" end="00:45:11.010" style="s2">the mechanism is different</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.970" end="00:45:12.570" style="s2">most of Antarctica the potential is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.010" end="00:45:15.180" style="s2">different you know we heard a report</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.570" end="00:45:17.670" style="s2">recently in the news that it was like 67</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.180" end="00:45:19.890" style="s2">degrees fahrenheit in Antarctica for the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.670" end="00:45:22.410" style="s2">first time ever but that was in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.890" end="00:45:26.190" style="s2">peninsula that was that was pretty far</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.410" end="00:45:28.290" style="s2">away from the core of Antarctica most of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.190" end="00:45:30.690" style="s2">Antarctica is way below the freezing</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.290" end="00:45:33.960" style="s2">point and therefore even in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.690" end="00:45:37.260" style="s2">of the summer the Antarctic summer it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.960" end="00:45:39.270" style="s2">still well below freezing and so it</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.260" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">could warm quite a bit and still not</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.270" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">melt and so some hot scientists actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:47.610" style="s2">think Antarctica will gain mass sometime</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">this century because the snowfall will</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.610" end="00:45:53.910" style="s2">increase and exceed the amount of ice</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:55.940" style="s2">that gets lost at the edges but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.910" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">scary about Antarctica is something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.940" end="00:46:00.330" style="s2">the mechanism for mass loss from</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:03.270" style="s2">Antarctica is not summer melting because</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.330" end="00:46:06.690" style="s2">it&#39;s so cold it&#39;s actually the flow of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.270" end="00:46:09.600" style="s2">ice into the ocean and right now that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.690" end="00:46:10.860" style="s2">flow is being impeded by large pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.600" end="00:46:14.460" style="s2">ice that are floating on the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.860" end="00:46:16.350" style="s2">called ice shelves the recent Pine</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.460" end="00:46:18.060" style="s2">Island Ice Shelf has been breaking up</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.350" end="00:46:20.250" style="s2">and it was in the news recently you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.060" end="00:46:21.660" style="s2">an enormous iceberg the size of Rhode</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.250" end="00:46:24.450" style="s2">Island dropped off or something like</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.660" end="00:46:25.980" style="s2">that but the big concern is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.450" end="00:46:26.930" style="s2">lose the big ice shelves and the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.980" end="00:46:29.510" style="s2">ones are called the Ross</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.930" end="00:46:31.640" style="s2">shelf the Rani ice shelf those ice</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.510" end="00:46:34.119" style="s2">shelves act a little bit like corks in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.640" end="00:46:36.559" style="s2">bottle they actually keep the glaciers</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.119" end="00:46:39.980" style="s2">sitting near the coast from flowing into</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.559" end="00:46:41.300" style="s2">the ocean now the ice shelves themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.980" end="00:46:42.680" style="s2">don&#39;t change the level because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.300" end="00:46:45.170" style="s2">already floating on the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.680" end="00:46:47.390" style="s2">they&#39;re already displacing seawater but</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.170" end="00:46:49.670" style="s2">if they break off suddenly there could</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">be very rapid flow of ice from the land</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.670" end="00:46:54.380" style="s2">into the ocean and that would affect the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:56.390" style="s2">sea level and a scary thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.380" end="00:46:57.500" style="s2">is not the time scale they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.390" end="00:47:02.780" style="s2">not it&#39;s not gonna happen overnight</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.500" end="00:47:05.960" style="s2">because fundamentally glacial flow can</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.780" end="00:47:08.930" style="s2">only happen so fast the scary part is</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.960" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">that that glacial flow doesn&#39;t care what</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.930" end="00:47:14.030" style="s2">the surface temperature is it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:17.480" style="s2">driven by gravity these glaciers are</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.030" end="00:47:19.760" style="s2">flowing downhill and once you lose the</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.480" end="00:47:21.890" style="s2">barrier you lose the ice shelf there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.760" end="00:47:24.710" style="s2">really not much we can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.890" end="00:47:27.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve now committed the earth to</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.710" end="00:47:30.500" style="s2">probably centuries - maybe millennia of</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:33.260" style="s2">continued sea-level rise you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.500" end="00:47:34.490" style="s2">10 or 20 meters of sea level rise for</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.260" end="00:47:36.020" style="s2">the next millennia and there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.490" end="00:47:37.700" style="s2">future generations are just gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.020" end="00:47:39.380" style="s2">to deal with it and so we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.700" end="00:47:42.380" style="s2">decisions now that affect the earth for</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.380" end="00:47:45.380" style="s2">thousands of years and and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.380" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">thinking about it that way mmm that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.380" end="00:47:50.059" style="s2">interesting thought glad I live at 2200</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:51.619" style="s2">feet not gonna be pretty for a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.059" end="00:47:53.930" style="s2">of the world&#39;s population that lives</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.619" end="00:47:55.430" style="s2">within 10 meters of sea level and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.930" end="00:47:57.710" style="s2">what a billion people something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.430" end="00:48:00.829" style="s2">that yeah although I got to tell you if</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.710" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">the time scale this is again one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.829" end="00:48:04.940" style="s2">fascinating parts of climate change</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:07.460" style="s2">economists will tell you look over a</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.940" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">hundred years you can move cities part</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.460" end="00:48:12.170" style="s2">of the problem of climate change you</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">know you know I&#39;ve been watching what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.170" end="00:48:16.549" style="s2">happening with coronavirus right now</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:19.670" style="s2">around the world people stopping travel</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.549" end="00:48:20.930" style="s2">quarantine eating people and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.670" end="00:48:23.000" style="s2">about how people are reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.930" end="00:48:25.609" style="s2">coronavirus versus reacting to climate</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.000" end="00:48:28.549" style="s2">change think about how different that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.609" end="00:48:30.440" style="s2">I think it&#39;s fascinating to see how</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.549" end="00:48:33.140" style="s2">people deal with an acute situation and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.440" end="00:48:35.270" style="s2">they panic nobody is asking well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.140" end="00:48:37.880" style="s2">the cost-benefit of cutting off flight</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.270" end="00:48:39.559" style="s2">stick to China right we&#39;re just doing it</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.880" end="00:48:40.640" style="s2">it&#39;s a public health issue it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:48:40.640" end="00:48:45.109" style="s2">we&#39;re canceling flights we&#39;re shutting</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.859" end="00:48:46.369" style="s2">down a Chinese cities literally people</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.109" end="00:48:49.099" style="s2">are not allowed out of their homes in</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.369" end="00:48:49.880" style="s2">China and by the way that may be the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.099" end="00:48:51.740" style="s2">right decision</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.880" end="00:48:53.750" style="s2">I&#39;m not questioning that decision I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.740" end="00:48:57.349" style="s2">just saying it&#39;s interesting how people</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.750" end="00:48:59.660" style="s2">respond to an acute concern whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.349" end="00:49:02.049" style="s2">long timescales change everything and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.660" end="00:49:05.930" style="s2">and here&#39;s what makes me uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.049" end="00:49:08.750" style="s2">we&#39;re really not good at thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.930" end="00:49:11.869" style="s2">the economics or the ethics of long</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.750" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">timescales you can convince yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.869" end="00:49:16.130" style="s2">that on a several hundred year timescale</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:16.849" style="s2">economically it makes sense to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.130" end="00:49:19.970" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.849" end="00:49:21.589" style="s2">let&#39;s see level rise and move people and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.970" end="00:49:23.420" style="s2">adapt to it because over a few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.589" end="00:49:25.670" style="s2">years think about it none of the cities</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.420" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">we have in the world are more than 200</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.670" end="00:49:29.839" style="s2">years old I mean obviously Paris London</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:31.789" style="s2">or much older than that but most of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.839" end="00:49:33.980" style="s2">their buildings are much younger than</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.789" end="00:49:37.309" style="s2">that you could rebuild them no problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.980" end="00:49:39.799" style="s2">and yet I have the sense that 200 years</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.309" end="00:49:41.329" style="s2">from now people are gonna you know our</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.799" end="00:49:44.029" style="s2">descendants are gonna look back at us</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.329" end="00:49:46.430" style="s2">with horror they&#39;re gonna say what were</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.029" end="00:49:50.509" style="s2">they thinking yep look what they did to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.430" end="00:49:53.599" style="s2">us and yet at any step in the way it</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.509" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">seems logical and practical to do very</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.599" end="00:49:57.710" style="s2">little and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:59.750" style="s2">very troubling about this long time</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.710" end="00:50:01.579" style="s2">scale thing we really don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.750" end="00:50:03.710" style="s2">deal with long timescales and think</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.579" end="00:50:05.539" style="s2">about the long term commitments you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.710" end="00:50:07.309" style="s2">in economics you deal with discount</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.539" end="00:50:09.039" style="s2">rates and there&#39;s a whole discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.309" end="00:50:11.630" style="s2">what the right discount rate should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.039" end="00:50:13.339" style="s2">but you know I think they&#39;ve confused</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.630" end="00:50:15.950" style="s2">something discount rates really asked</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.339" end="00:50:18.890" style="s2">the question you know how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.950" end="00:50:19.970" style="s2">rationally should you pay to avoid some</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.890" end="00:50:22.279" style="s2">damage in the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.970" end="00:50:24.500" style="s2">and they&#39;ve quite reasonably recognised</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.279" end="00:50:27.319" style="s2">that a dollar today is worth more than a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.500" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">dollar 50 years from now and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.319" end="00:50:33.289" style="s2">you should pay less to avoid something</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:34.670" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna happen 50 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.289" end="00:50:36.680" style="s2">than to avoid something that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.670" end="00:50:39.410" style="s2">happen tomorrow</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.410" end="00:50:44.540" style="s2">is the moral ethical dimension of this</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.180" end="00:50:47.750" style="s2">which is we&#39;re talking about decisions</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.540" end="00:50:50.660" style="s2">we&#39;re making for literally thousands of</p>

<p begin="00:50:50.660" end="00:50:56.569" style="s2">been born yet and so the question is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.680" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">how much should we pay or how much are</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.569" end="00:51:01.670" style="s2">we willing to pay the question is what</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:04.309" style="s2">moral obligation do we have to provide</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.670" end="00:51:06.920" style="s2">future generations on this planet the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.309" end="00:51:10.940" style="s2">same kind of opportunities that we have</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.920" end="00:51:12.859" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very different question yep</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.940" end="00:51:15.800" style="s2">very well said and it&#39;s actually worse</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.859" end="00:51:18.200" style="s2">than that Dan if we took the economic</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.800" end="00:51:19.940" style="s2">discount rates we would still be taking</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.000" end="00:51:34.309" style="s2">discount things hyperbolically even more</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.520" end="00:51:36.740" style="s2">extremely than the exponential that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.309" end="00:51:39.740" style="s2">get from fixed interest rates and so our</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.740" end="00:51:41.480" style="s2">politics is driven probably to a</p>

<p begin="00:51:41.480" end="00:51:46.790" style="s2">discounting where the future disappears</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.160" end="00:51:48.619" style="s2">entirely which is even worse hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.790" end="00:51:49.089" style="s2">discounting can be it depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.619" end="00:51:51.290" style="s2">the rate is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.089" end="00:51:53.599" style="s2">actually maybe a better thing for the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.290" end="00:51:55.790" style="s2">long term because what hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.599" end="00:51:57.700" style="s2">discounting does is actually say the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.790" end="00:52:00.380" style="s2">long term future is not where zero</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.700" end="00:52:03.859" style="s2">exponential of discounting the long term</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.380" end="00:52:06.859" style="s2">future is literally zero</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.859" end="00:52:08.809" style="s2">you know asymptotes to zero but with</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.859" end="00:52:10.490" style="s2">hyperbolic discounting the distant</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.809" end="00:52:12.890" style="s2">future is worth something it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.490" end="00:52:14.839" style="s2">worth very little and it&#39;s the same so</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.890" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">we don&#39;t distinguish between and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.839" end="00:52:19.940" style="s2">and that&#39;s behavioral the consistent</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:21.650" style="s2">with experiments when you ask people how</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.940" end="00:52:24.200" style="s2">much is it worth to you to to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.650" end="00:52:26.599" style="s2">something 200 years from now or 500</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.200" end="00:52:28.730" style="s2">years from now the answer is it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.599" end="00:52:30.710" style="s2">something it&#39;s just very very little and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.730" end="00:52:31.940" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.710" end="00:52:34.339" style="s2">two hundred or five hundred or a</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.940" end="00:52:36.410" style="s2">thousand so that&#39;s where the hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.339" end="00:52:38.089" style="s2">idea comes from and so that is a little</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.410" end="00:52:40.339" style="s2">better than some ways then exponential</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.089" end="00:52:43.299" style="s2">discounting but I think the whole</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:46.040" style="s2">discussion is still misplaced because</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.299" end="00:52:48.829" style="s2">that&#39;s not really what the question is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.040" end="00:52:50.060" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not how much should we be</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.829" end="00:52:51.920" style="s2">willing to pay</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.060" end="00:52:53.330" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of what moral obligation</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:55.610" style="s2">do we have and that&#39;s a very different</p>

<p begin="00:53:10.010" end="00:53:14.720" style="s2">answer was to use a zero discount rate</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.230" end="00:53:16.580" style="s2">you know it&#39;s interesting I think just</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.720" end="00:53:18.890" style="s2">the problem of the whole exponential</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.580" end="00:53:21.080" style="s2">discounting framework might lead you to</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.130" end="00:54:44.300" style="s2">a lot of good news but the fundamental</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.610" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">holds let&#39;s review some of the good news</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.620" end="00:54:53.270" style="s2">really quickly so if you think about 10</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:58.130" style="s2">or 11 years ago when Obama first came</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.270" end="00:55:01.040" style="s2">into office in 2009 and he actually had</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.130" end="00:55:02.820" style="s2">a giant stimulus package because of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.040" end="00:55:04.890" style="s2">global finance oh because of the because</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.820" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">because of our financial crisis but it</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.890" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">was really a global financial crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:10.650" style="s2">we had he had close to 100 billion</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:13.260" style="s2">dollars he was willing to spend on</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.650" end="00:55:15.570" style="s2">energy and what&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.260" end="00:55:18.210" style="s2">remember is that even 10 or 11 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.570" end="00:55:20.670" style="s2">solar and wind weren&#39;t really high on</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.210" end="00:55:22.380" style="s2">the priority list we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.670" end="00:55:23.580" style="s2">transmission we talked about carbon</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.380" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">capture and storage we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.580" end="00:55:27.270" style="s2">nuclear we talked about a number of</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:30.150" style="s2">things and the reason was that solar and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.270" end="00:55:32.460" style="s2">wind were still quite expensive in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.150" end="00:55:36.570" style="s2">last 10 years that has been completely</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.460" end="00:55:39.980" style="s2">changed today solar and wind again</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.570" end="00:55:43.410" style="s2">without storage low penetration but</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.980" end="00:55:46.320" style="s2">solar and wind are in most places in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.410" end="00:55:48.330" style="s2">u.s. that is reasonably windy places or</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.320" end="00:55:50.310" style="s2">reasonably sunny places are actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.330" end="00:55:52.350" style="s2">much cheaper than any other form of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.310" end="00:55:54.090" style="s2">generation including very very cheap</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.350" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">natural gas which is another big change</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.090" end="00:56:01.740" style="s2">in the last decade for the u.s. at least</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:56:03.390" style="s2">so so that is incredibly good news we</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.740" end="00:56:06.900" style="s2">didn&#39;t think that solar and wind was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.390" end="00:56:10.590" style="s2">viable financial options 10 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.900" end="00:56:12.840" style="s2">today it is in Massachusetts for example</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.590" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">10 years ago we were fighting over a</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.840" end="00:56:16.740" style="s2">project called Cape wind which was a big</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:18.630" style="s2">offshore wind project in Massachusetts</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.740" end="00:56:20.940" style="s2">here in Massachusetts it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.630" end="00:56:22.800" style="s2">sunny and it&#39;s not very windy on shore</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.940" end="00:56:25.380" style="s2">but off shore we have good wind resource</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.800" end="00:56:27.420" style="s2">and so the idea was to build windmills</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.380" end="00:56:29.100" style="s2">and and they were controversial because</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.420" end="00:56:32.130" style="s2">the Kennedys didn&#39;t want it to obstruct</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.100" end="00:56:34.230" style="s2">their view off of Hyannis Port so there</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.130" end="00:56:37.760" style="s2">was lots of local politics and you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.230" end="00:56:40.350" style="s2">a NIMBYism that is not in my backyard</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.760" end="00:56:43.110" style="s2">but in the end one of the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.350" end="00:56:46.470" style="s2">with Cape Wind was that it was about 20</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.110" end="00:56:48.450" style="s2">cents a kilowatt hour for the grid to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.470" end="00:56:52.230" style="s2">buy that&#39;s wholesale price that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.450" end="00:56:54.150" style="s2">selling to us we pay residentially about</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.230" end="00:56:55.980" style="s2">21 cents a kilowatt hour in</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.150" end="00:56:57.710" style="s2">Massachusetts it&#39;s among the highest</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.980" end="00:57:00.600" style="s2">price of electricity in the country</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.710" end="00:57:02.820" style="s2">maybe a little bit less than Hawaii but</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.600" end="00:57:05.700" style="s2">but as high as anywhere else but the</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.700" end="00:57:12.170" style="s2">more like 6 or 7 cents so 20 cents a</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.180" end="00:57:14.970" style="s2">kilowatt hour was incredibly high today</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.830" end="00:57:27.120" style="s2">incredibly exciting in just ten years</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.650" end="00:57:28.920" style="s2">nobody would have predicted that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.120" end="00:57:32.550" style="s2">incredible cost draw down for wind and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.920" end="00:57:34.590" style="s2">solar and so in some ways the changes in</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.550" end="00:57:36.690" style="s2">prices mean that at least for the next</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.590" end="00:57:38.040" style="s2">couple of decades the whole world is</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.690" end="00:57:40.050" style="s2">just gonna be building out wind and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.040" end="00:57:41.660" style="s2">solar because it&#39;s so cheap and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.050" end="00:57:44.550" style="s2">really good news</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.660" end="00:57:45.680" style="s2">but understand also that that&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.550" end="00:57:47.940" style="s2">first step</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.680" end="00:57:48.750" style="s2">decarbonizing our economy involves lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.940" end="00:57:51.000" style="s2">of different steps</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.750" end="00:57:54.540" style="s2">I think another bit of good news is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.000" end="00:57:56.520" style="s2">electric cars have emerged as a what</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.540" end="00:57:59.390" style="s2">looks to be a viable alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.520" end="00:58:03.620" style="s2">gasoline powered vehicles and I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.390" end="00:58:07.590" style="s2">maybe not in ten years but in 20 years I</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.620" end="00:58:09.210" style="s2">suspect that we will see I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.590" end="00:58:12.000" style="s2">twenty to fifty percent of new vehicles</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.210" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">sold in the u.s. being electric least I</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.000" end="00:58:16.350" style="s2">hope that we&#39;ll get there right now the</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:18.780" style="s2">price still needs to come down a little</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.350" end="00:58:20.010" style="s2">bit but I suspect that will happen the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.780" end="00:58:22.980" style="s2">same way it did for solar and wind</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.010" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">currently electric vehicles are about</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.980" end="00:58:29.400" style="s2">twice as expensive as a gasoline powered</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:30.870" style="s2">equivalent vehicle and there are range</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.400" end="00:58:33.600" style="s2">concerns because we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.870" end="00:58:36.710" style="s2">charging stations but I suspect over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.600" end="00:58:39.240" style="s2">next decade or two many places will</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.710" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">solve that problem and the prices will</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.240" end="00:58:44.310" style="s2">come down many car companies are</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:46.590" style="s2">investing in that last year or in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.310" end="00:58:48.930" style="s2">2% of new vehicle sales were electric</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.590" end="00:58:50.640" style="s2">vehicles and I think that number will</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.930" end="00:58:51.900" style="s2">slowly grow and that&#39;s a good thing too</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.640" end="00:58:55.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna happen all over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.900" end="00:58:58.170" style="s2">world the bad news is that probably only</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.770" end="00:59:01.680" style="s2">gets you thirty to fifty percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.170" end="00:59:03.660" style="s2">way to where you need to go in first of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.680" end="00:59:05.100" style="s2">all that has to be global so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.660" end="00:59:07.080" style="s2">get all the countries in the world to do</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.100" end="00:59:08.940" style="s2">it and then there&#39;s the really hard</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.080" end="00:59:13.200" style="s2">stuff how do you get rid of diesel fuel</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.940" end="00:59:16.320" style="s2">for trucks or trains or ships how do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.200" end="00:59:20.670" style="s2">get rid of heavy industry cement plants</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.320" end="00:59:24.450" style="s2">the missions from that smelting how do</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.670" end="00:59:26.970" style="s2">you get rid of jet fuel those are really</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.450" end="00:59:28.770" style="s2">hard problems and there are a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.970" end="00:59:29.400" style="s2">ideas but they all look very very</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.770" end="00:59:31.470" style="s2">expensive</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.400" end="00:59:33.930" style="s2">and frankly those are gonna be the hard</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.470" end="00:59:35.940" style="s2">parts of decarbonisation and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.930" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">think we&#39;re likely to get started on</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.940" end="00:59:40.290" style="s2">those in a very serious way I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:41.970" style="s2">we&#39;ll see early experiments and you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.290" end="00:59:43.830" style="s2">little startups and things but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.970" end="00:59:45.900" style="s2">think we&#39;ll have serious market for</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.830" end="00:59:48.030" style="s2">those things for several decades into</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.900" end="00:59:50.820" style="s2">the future policies gonna have a big</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.030" end="00:59:53.100" style="s2">role we need to you know enact policies</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.820" end="00:59:55.050" style="s2">that will accelerate this time scale but</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.100" end="00:59:56.610" style="s2">from my perspective I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.050" end="00:59:58.800" style="s2">fooling ourselves about how long this</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.610" end="01:00:00.720" style="s2">transition is going to take I think if</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.800" end="01:00:03.660" style="s2">we&#39;re really committed and we had</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.720" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">incredible political will globally it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.660" end="01:00:07.260" style="s2">gonna take more than 50 years and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.550" style="s2">could be closer to 100 I wish that</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.260" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2">weren&#39;t true I wish we could accelerate</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.550" end="01:00:14.430" style="s2">it faster but but the numbers are really</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.080" style="s2">big and really difficult and we also</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.430" end="01:00:18.620" style="s2">sometimes forget that it&#39;s global you</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.080" end="01:00:20.280" style="s2">know in the u.s. we talk about you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.620" end="01:00:22.080" style="s2">environmental movement talks about</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.280" end="01:00:24.510" style="s2">decarbonizing the u.s. as quickly as</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.080" end="01:00:27.990" style="s2">possible everybody&#39;s focused on when are</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.510" end="01:00:32.130" style="s2">we gonna get to zero emissions and from</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.990" end="01:00:34.320" style="s2">my perspective people sometimes forget</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.130" end="01:00:37.290" style="s2">that getting the u.s. to zero emissions</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.320" end="01:00:39.960" style="s2">is actually not the goal the goal is</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.290" end="01:00:41.400" style="s2">getting the world to zero emissions the</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.960" end="01:00:44.070" style="s2">climate system really doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.400" end="01:00:47.160" style="s2">the emissions in the US now that is not</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.070" end="01:00:49.320" style="s2">to say us shouldn&#39;t play or must I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.160" end="01:00:51.660" style="s2">envision us must play a leading role I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.320" end="01:00:53.130" style="s2">think we have an obligation as the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.660" end="01:00:54.720" style="s2">world&#39;s largest economy and it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:00:57.840" end="01:01:01.980" style="s2">solution but understand the leadership</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.150" end="01:01:04.700" style="s2">means getting other people to follow it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.980" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just mean charging ahead and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.700" end="01:01:09.810" style="s2">our goal should not be to decarbonize</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:11.910" style="s2">the US as quickly as possible we have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.810" end="01:01:14.550" style="s2">much more difficult goal which is to</p>

<p begin="01:01:18.990" end="01:01:25.350" style="s2">follow us and that unfortunately is much</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.440" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">much more challenging because it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.350" end="01:01:29.210" style="s2">just be that we do it we have to do it</p>

<p begin="01:01:29.210" end="01:01:34.230" style="s2">indeed indeed now with respect to those</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.130" end="01:01:36.570" style="s2">concentrated energy sources that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.230" end="01:01:38.460" style="s2">mentioned jet fuel long-haul diesel at</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.430" end="01:01:58.740" style="s2">difficult when they actually start to</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.660" end="01:02:00.720" style="s2">look at the numbers because</p>

<p begin="01:02:04.680" end="01:02:08.400" style="s2">turned into diesel fuel or jet fuel</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.270" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a fabulous technology that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.400" end="01:02:13.140" style="s2">used by the Germans in World War two it</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.079" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">was used by a part tide regime in South</p>

<p begin="01:02:21.720" end="01:02:26.309" style="s2">high-quality jet fuel or diesel fuel</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.160" end="01:02:27.990" style="s2">it&#39;s fabulous fuel and if you sequester</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.309" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">the co2 it could actually be carbon</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.990" end="01:02:34.890" style="s2">negative but and as you say with a</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:37.470" style="s2">little bit more cost you could scrub co2</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.890" end="01:02:40.020" style="s2">out of the air and add hydrogen and</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.470" end="01:02:43.589" style="s2">converted to diesel fuel or jet fuel</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.020" end="01:02:47.010" style="s2">using similar technology the problem</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.589" end="01:02:50.940" style="s2">though is cost that&#39;s one problem it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.010" end="01:02:55.049" style="s2">lot more expensive so you know today the</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.940" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">global price of oils around 70 bucks but</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.049" end="01:03:01.589" style="s2">occasionally it falls to 40 or 50</p>

<p begin="01:03:24.750" end="01:03:29.190" style="s2">problem is cost so making biodiesel is</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.480" end="01:03:31.589" style="s2">much more and much much much more</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.190" end="01:03:33.690" style="s2">expensive and scrubbing co2 out of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:40.170" style="s2">more times more expensive and petroleum</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.369" end="01:03:42.180" style="s2">and so right now people aren&#39;t willing</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.170" end="01:03:45.510" style="s2">to pay that difference but the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.180" end="01:03:49.710" style="s2">problem is the scale if you start trying</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.510" end="01:03:52.230" style="s2">to get all of your fuel from biofuel the</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.549" end="01:04:03.299" style="s2">work it&#39;s gonna be interesting I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.859" end="01:04:05.280" style="s2">for diesel trucks things like</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.299" end="01:04:06.839" style="s2">potentially hydrogen fuel cell vehicles</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.280" end="01:04:08.339" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting idea there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.839" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">company called Nikola motors that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.339" end="01:04:14.460" style="s2">making trucks I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:17.190" style="s2">to be on your you know interstate</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.460" end="01:04:18.510" style="s2">anytime soon but I suspect in certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.190" end="01:04:19.980" style="s2">places where they could put in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.510" end="01:04:21.660" style="s2">infrastructure there&#39;s a chicken-egg</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.980" end="01:04:23.730" style="s2">problem you need to have hydrogen</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.660" end="01:04:25.430" style="s2">fueling stations before anybody&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.730" end="01:04:27.390" style="s2">invest in a hydrogen powered truck</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.430" end="01:04:30.390" style="s2">because they can&#39;t drive a truck if they</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.390" end="01:04:32.040" style="s2">can&#39;t refill it on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.390" end="01:04:33.450" style="s2">can&#39;t really pay for making a hydrogen</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.040" end="01:04:35.099" style="s2">fueling station if there&#39;s no trucks</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.450" end="01:04:37.260" style="s2">that want to use it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.099" end="01:04:38.549" style="s2">chicken-egg problem there I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.260" end="01:04:40.799" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting opportunity in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.549" end="01:04:43.500" style="s2">place like California in the i-5</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:46.290" style="s2">corridor between Sacramento and and Los</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.500" end="01:04:48.210" style="s2">Angeles I could imagine putting in you</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.290" end="01:04:50.700" style="s2">know three or four hydrogen fueling</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.210" end="01:04:53.339" style="s2">stations and requiring that a certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.700" end="01:04:54.960" style="s2">fraction of trucks use hydrogen to clean</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.339" end="01:04:57.420" style="s2">up the pollution in the San Joaquin</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.960" end="01:04:59.790" style="s2">Valley I think you might see regional</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.420" end="01:05:01.380" style="s2">experiments like that but for now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.790" end="01:05:02.790" style="s2">going to be very limited but I think in</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.380" end="01:05:05.099" style="s2">the long run hydrogen is gonna give</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.790" end="01:05:07.020" style="s2">diesel fuel and diesel trucks have run</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.099" end="01:05:08.849" style="s2">for their money but that&#39;s gonna take I</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.020" end="01:05:11.250" style="s2">think many decades before that happens</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.849" end="01:05:12.869" style="s2">and the other alternative though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.250" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">decades long and building infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.869" end="01:05:17.280" style="s2">it would be electrically powered trains</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:19.530" style="s2">to replace a fair amount of the long</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.280" end="01:05:20.940" style="s2">haul trucking at least I won&#39;t get rid</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.530" end="01:05:23.490" style="s2">of the short haul but let&#39;s get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.940" end="01:05:26.849" style="s2">some of the long haul so you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.490" end="01:05:29.869" style="s2">US you could imagine that the challenge</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.849" end="01:05:33.119" style="s2">is that a lot of the long haul transport</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.869" end="01:05:34.770" style="s2">you know we used to do it by trains but</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.119" end="01:05:37.559" style="s2">the problem is we&#39;ve torn up most of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.770" end="01:05:41.010" style="s2">those train tracks we&#39;ve built suburbs</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.559" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">and we&#39;ve built bicycle paths right</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.010" end="01:05:44.819" style="s2">think of all the rail trails that exist</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:47.099" style="s2">in every community that you know of and</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.819" end="01:05:50.940" style="s2">most of the communities don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.099" end="01:05:52.890" style="s2">bring back railroads and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.940" end="01:05:54.960" style="s2">in a very interesting part of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.890" end="01:05:57.990" style="s2">climate change dilemma that I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.960" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">people don&#39;t understand decarbonizing</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.990" end="01:06:01.770" style="s2">our economies whether in the US or</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:03.690" style="s2">anywhere else in the world it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.770" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">the biggest construction project that</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.690" end="01:06:09.199" style="s2">humans have ever attempted by far</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">it is a massive capital investment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.199" end="01:06:14.989" style="s2">an ax massive infrastructure investment</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:17.959" style="s2">and if you want to do it quickly you</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.989" end="01:06:20.539" style="s2">can&#39;t allow the normal permitting</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.959" end="01:06:22.670" style="s2">process to happen truth is that today</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.539" end="01:06:27.619" style="s2">it&#39;s really difficult to build anything</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.670" end="01:06:30.410" style="s2">a transmission line a pipeline a train</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.619" end="01:06:32.150" style="s2">track nobody wants it near them nobody</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.410" end="01:06:33.859" style="s2">wants the train tracks going next to</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.150" end="01:06:36.140" style="s2">their house nobody wants the</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.859" end="01:06:39.920" style="s2">transmission line impinging on their</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.140" end="01:06:42.380" style="s2">hike or their view or whatever and so as</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.920" end="01:06:44.900" style="s2">a result you know NIMBY which is not in</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.380" end="01:06:47.719" style="s2">my backyard has become banana which is</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.900" end="01:06:52.369" style="s2">build absolutely nothing anywhere near</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.719" end="01:06:55.009" style="s2">anything and that&#39;s a reality in the US</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.369" end="01:06:56.689" style="s2">so what people don&#39;t understand is if</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.009" end="01:06:59.239" style="s2">you really committed to climate change</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.689" end="01:07:02.989" style="s2">you have to suspend kind of community</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.239" end="01:07:04.910" style="s2">permitting processes and just have total</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.989" end="01:07:06.140" style="s2">control and say okay we&#39;re gonna build</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.910" end="01:07:07.910" style="s2">this pipeline there we&#39;re gonna build</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.140" end="01:07:10.489" style="s2">that transmission line there we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.910" end="01:07:12.469" style="s2">put this train track in here and people</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.489" end="01:07:14.509" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna like it so you know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.469" end="01:07:16.759" style="s2">works in China it&#39;s an authoritarian</p>

<p begin="01:07:18.949" end="01:07:25.219" style="s2">quickly for good reason people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.749" end="01:07:26.599" style="s2">like being forced to to suddenly have</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.219" end="01:07:28.699" style="s2">train tracks pop up near their house</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.599" end="01:07:33.529" style="s2">think about New York and Boston for</p>

<p begin="01:07:33.529" end="01:07:38.599" style="s2">French technology we should have a train</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.259" end="01:07:41.929" style="s2">from Boston to New York that takes about</p>

<p begin="01:07:51.339" end="01:07:55.459" style="s2">why don&#39;t we have a fast train from New</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.869" end="01:07:57.949" style="s2">York to Boston the current train takes a</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.459" end="01:08:00.229" style="s2">little under four hours instead of</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.949" end="01:08:02.839" style="s2">forty-five minutes it would be great</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.229" end="01:08:04.999" style="s2">economically for everybody the reason we</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.839" end="01:08:07.569" style="s2">don&#39;t is because of Connecticut the only</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.569" end="01:08:12.650" style="s2">build train tracks straight through from</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.770" end="01:08:30.339" style="s2">so I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of skeptical that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:08:36.350" end="01:08:39.799" style="s2">really fix this problem so I&#39;m skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.029" end="01:08:42.980" style="s2">on trains just because I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="01:09:45.319" end="01:09:50.540" style="s2">more trains or having biodiesel plants</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.440" end="01:09:53.540" style="s2">nearby etc we will see if they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.540" end="01:09:55.280" style="s2">truly sincere about attacking climate</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.540" end="01:09:56.570" style="s2">change they may well yield on some of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">these things so I&#39;m not as pessimistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.570" end="01:10:00.850" style="s2">as you are come back you know thirty</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:04.280" style="s2">years from now it may be that we see a</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.850" end="01:10:06.440" style="s2">resurgence of electric trains both light</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.280" end="01:10:08.210" style="s2">and heavy but that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.440" end="01:10:10.489" style="s2">unknown and as you say it is part of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.210" end="01:10:12.290" style="s2">this collective action problem which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.489" end="01:10:13.940" style="s2">that kind of the core of making this</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.290" end="01:10:16.460" style="s2">even more difficult than it is from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.940" end="01:10:17.929" style="s2">technology perspective that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.460" end="01:10:21.380" style="s2">mean again if it were just about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.929" end="01:10:23.270" style="s2">u.s. decarbonizing the u.s. I think you</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.380" end="01:10:25.190" style="s2">know people might be willing to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.270" end="01:10:27.050" style="s2">make the sacrifices you know an</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.190" end="01:10:29.060" style="s2">inspiring example that some people use</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.050" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">is world war two where we had great</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.060" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">sacrifice and we achieved and build far</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:35.200" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:37.630" style="s2">world war 2 in terms of tanks and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.200" end="01:10:41.020" style="s2">airplanes artillery units and everything</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.630" end="01:10:42.760" style="s2">else far more than we expected in a very</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.020" end="01:10:45.070" style="s2">short amount of time but people made</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.760" end="01:10:47.530" style="s2">real sacrifices we spent 30 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.070" end="01:10:49.390" style="s2">our GDP on the war more than 30 percent</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.530" end="01:10:52.450" style="s2">of our GDP for for three and a half</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.390" end="01:10:54.790" style="s2">years was an extraordinary sacrifice I</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.450" end="01:10:56.680" style="s2">think if it was if we could fix the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.790" end="01:11:00.430" style="s2">problem that way people might be willing</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.680" end="01:11:02.620" style="s2">to do that but here&#39;s the challenge it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.430" end="01:11:05.140" style="s2">a global and so the argument well why</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.620" end="01:11:08.200" style="s2">would we do that and risk the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.140" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">the world not following you know if we</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.200" end="01:11:13.830" style="s2">don&#39;t know that China and India and</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:16.570" style="s2">Thailand and Myanmar and Pakistan and</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.830" end="01:11:21.160" style="s2">you know Indonesia are gonna actually do</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.570" end="01:11:23.200" style="s2">the same thing why should we make these</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.160" end="01:11:25.090" style="s2">great sacrifices and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.200" end="01:11:27.240" style="s2">collective-action part the the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.090" end="01:11:30.070" style="s2">free-rider aspect is really tough to</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.240" end="01:11:31.450" style="s2">solve so there&#39;s one way to start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.070" end="01:11:32.830" style="s2">address it that&#39;s funny you mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.450" end="01:11:35.340" style="s2">world war two I&#39;m working on an essay</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.830" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">where I&#39;m trying to calculate what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.340" end="01:11:42.820" style="s2">1944 global GDP equivalent is to fix</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:45.340" style="s2">climate change 1944 was the peak year of</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.820" end="01:11:48.100" style="s2">level of effort in World War two u.s.</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.340" end="01:11:50.650" style="s2">was about 50 percent of GDP Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.100" end="01:11:52.690" style="s2">Russia were at 70 percent of GDP Japan</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.650" end="01:11:55.480" style="s2">might have been at 80 percent of GDP and</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.690" end="01:11:57.760" style="s2">if you do that a global basis I might be</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.480" end="01:11:59.380" style="s2">30 percent of global GDP went into</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.760" end="01:12:01.510" style="s2">fighting World War two so how many</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.380" end="01:12:04.120" style="s2">thirty percent of global GDP does it</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.510" end="01:12:05.440" style="s2">take to fix climate and I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.120" end="01:12:07.600" style="s2">those numbers when I&#39;m done with it I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.440" end="01:12:09.790" style="s2">publish the result there is one way to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.600" end="01:12:11.620" style="s2">get some traction on this collective</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.790" end="01:12:14.440" style="s2">action problem internationally which is</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.620" end="01:12:17.170" style="s2">suppose the u.s. the advanced economies</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.440" end="01:12:20.140" style="s2">of the eastern rim of Asia and Western</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.170" end="01:12:21.880" style="s2">Europe all declared that they were going</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.140" end="01:12:24.490" style="s2">to attack this at a world war two level</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.880" end="01:12:27.610" style="s2">of intensity and that they were going to</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.490" end="01:12:29.290" style="s2">put in place tariffs equal to that cost</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.610" end="01:12:32.680" style="s2">from countries that weren&#39;t making that</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.290" end="01:12:35.050" style="s2">effort hmm so if China and India said</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.680" end="01:12:37.930" style="s2">they&#39;re not doing anything about climate</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.050" end="01:12:40.240" style="s2">then everything that they export to all</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.930" end="01:12:43.300" style="s2">these advanced countries will get a very</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.240" end="01:12:45.640" style="s2">stiff tariff on them equal to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.300" end="01:12:46.719" style="s2">imputed capital cost of removing that</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.640" end="01:12:49.210" style="s2">much carbon</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.719" end="01:12:51.070" style="s2">hmmm interesting yeah that starts the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.210" end="01:12:54.160" style="s2">cycle goin and particularly China and</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.070" end="01:12:56.260" style="s2">India are very dependent on exports to</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.160" end="01:12:57.969" style="s2">the advanced world so here&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.260" end="01:13:00.160" style="s2">without having their agreement we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.969" end="01:13:01.930" style="s2">just put up walls and say hey the walls</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.160" end="01:13:04.060" style="s2">are comin they start relatively low but</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.930" end="01:13:06.010" style="s2">they grow very fast very quickly maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.060" end="01:13:08.320" style="s2">we started at $50 a ton carbon</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.010" end="01:13:10.180" style="s2">equivalent charge so this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.320" end="01:13:12.040" style="s2">actually what&#39;s called you know border</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.180" end="01:13:13.660" style="s2">adjustments has actually been around for</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.040" end="01:13:15.280" style="s2">a long time people Khanna mists have</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.660" end="01:13:17.380" style="s2">been talking about kind of border</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.280" end="01:13:21.820" style="s2">adjustments and tariffs for on carbon</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.380" end="01:13:23.410" style="s2">for 30 years really since early days of</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.820" end="01:13:24.430" style="s2">carbon pricing because they wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.410" end="01:13:27.250" style="s2">make sure that it had an international</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.430" end="01:13:29.170" style="s2">component essentially forcing at the</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.250" end="01:13:30.460" style="s2">time they were worrying about China but</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.170" end="01:13:33.699" style="s2">now they&#39;d be forcing other countries</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.460" end="01:13:36.640" style="s2">the problem is that&#39;s good for a small</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.699" end="01:13:37.930" style="s2">number of rogue countries who refuse to</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.640" end="01:13:40.239" style="s2">play ball with the rest of the world for</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.930" end="01:13:42.760" style="s2">example if the US and China and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.239" end="01:13:44.670" style="s2">decided they would do this they could</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.760" end="01:13:47.680" style="s2">possibly stick it to Russia or to India</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.670" end="01:13:51.070" style="s2">but if say China isn&#39;t willing to play</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.680" end="01:13:53.230" style="s2">ball frankly I think the India&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.070" end="01:13:56.770" style="s2">dependence on the US or the EU is less</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.230" end="01:13:59.500" style="s2">than we think it is right now and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.770" end="01:14:02.710" style="s2">could be quite sufficient avoiding you</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.500" end="01:14:05.080" style="s2">know trade with the EU and the e in the</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.710" end="01:14:08.110" style="s2">US and mostly trade with China and</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.080" end="01:14:10.810" style="s2">Russia for example and do just fine so I</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.110" end="01:14:12.760" style="s2">think trade and and pressure on</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.810" end="01:14:14.140" style="s2">countries for climate change is a really</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.760" end="01:14:16.270" style="s2">important mechanism and it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.140" end="01:14:18.699" style="s2">been part of the of the policy</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.270" end="01:14:21.010" style="s2">discussions for a very long time but we</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.699" end="01:14:23.020" style="s2">understand it before you get there it</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.010" end="01:14:25.180" style="s2">needs to be you need to have most of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.020" end="01:14:27.910" style="s2">countries on board otherwise it just</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.180" end="01:14:29.590" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work yeah think about that and</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.910" end="01:14:30.880" style="s2">play a little game theory there because</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.590" end="01:14:32.710" style="s2">one of the interesting things is that</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.880" end="01:14:34.180" style="s2">suppose taina didn&#39;t want to go along</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.710" end="01:14:36.190" style="s2">India then has an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.180" end="01:14:38.830" style="s2">opportunity to grab business from China</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.190" end="01:14:40.870" style="s2">and I would say would apply for Myanmar</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.830" end="01:14:42.640" style="s2">and Vietnam but anyway let&#39;s move along</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.870" end="01:14:44.350" style="s2">here let&#39;s spend the rest of our time on</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.640" end="01:14:45.790" style="s2">geoengineering you spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.350" end="01:14:48.610" style="s2">thinking about it there are</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.790" end="01:14:50.050" style="s2">opportunities here there are risks tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.610" end="01:14:51.910" style="s2">us about your an engineering starting</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.050" end="01:14:54.640" style="s2">with what it is and then going through</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.910" end="01:14:55.900" style="s2">the risk rewards models preparation what</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.640" end="01:15:00.330" style="s2">would should we doing be doing about</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.900" end="01:15:01.620" style="s2">geoengineering sure so I think the issue</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.330" end="01:15:02.940" style="s2">Engineering first of all it&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.620" end="01:15:05.160" style="s2">breath the idea has been around a long</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.940" end="01:15:08.340" style="s2">time there was a report from the Johnson</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.160" end="01:15:10.410" style="s2">administration in the late 60s on solar</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.340" end="01:15:13.200" style="s2">geoengineering is a possible way of</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.410" end="01:15:15.330" style="s2">dealing with climate change so again you</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.200" end="01:15:19.770" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t a new idea it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.330" end="01:15:22.080" style="s2">old idea Edward Teller the physicist</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.770" end="01:15:23.730" style="s2">actually I think was a very attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.080" end="01:15:25.470" style="s2">this idea I think that should make</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.730" end="01:15:28.110" style="s2">everybody a little reticent knowing</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.470" end="01:15:30.690" style="s2">Edward Teller he was the father of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.110" end="01:15:31.680" style="s2">hydrogen bomb by the way right one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.690" end="01:15:34.380" style="s2">them well</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.680" end="01:15:35.760" style="s2">yeah although people would say Coulomb</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.380" end="01:15:38.610" style="s2">might have been actually the father of</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.760" end="01:15:39.750" style="s2">the hydrogen bomb but yes he was</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.610" end="01:15:41.130" style="s2">certainly one of the father he was</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.750" end="01:15:43.560" style="s2">certainly the champion of the hydrogen</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.130" end="01:15:45.990" style="s2">bomb if not the father of it maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.560" end="01:15:47.730" style="s2">Godfather of the hydrogen bomb and a</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.990" end="01:15:49.890" style="s2">very powerful influence on many</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.730" end="01:15:52.370" style="s2">presidents let&#39;s explain what it is</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.890" end="01:15:57.030" style="s2">Solar geoengineering really is modifying</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.370" end="01:16:00.180" style="s2">the albedo of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere so</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.030" end="01:16:03.120" style="s2">that we could reflect more sunlight to</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.180" end="01:16:05.340" style="s2">space essentially so as greenhouse gases</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.120" end="01:16:07.470" style="s2">build up in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere we</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.340" end="01:16:08.730" style="s2">would add more reflective particles to</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.470" end="01:16:11.670" style="s2">this to the atmosphere to the</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.730" end="01:16:13.740" style="s2">stratosphere and or I guess you could do</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.670" end="01:16:15.120" style="s2">with low-level as well and so that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.740" end="01:16:17.670" style="s2">would reflect more sunlight back to</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.120" end="01:16:19.710" style="s2">space essentially putting a Sun Shade on</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.670" end="01:16:23.580" style="s2">the earth and cooling the planet to</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.710" end="01:16:24.810" style="s2">compensate for climate change now the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.580" end="01:16:26.310" style="s2">first thing to be said is that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.810" end="01:16:30.410" style="s2">physics of this are not totally</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.310" end="01:16:34.170" style="s2">straightforward that is at first glance</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.410" end="01:16:36.600" style="s2">reflecting sunlight doesn&#39;t cancel out</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.170" end="01:16:38.220" style="s2">greenhouse gases you should understand</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.600" end="01:16:40.170" style="s2">that the physics of this is different</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.220" end="01:16:44.270" style="s2">that is greenhouse gases in the</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.170" end="01:16:46.440" style="s2">atmosphere work 24 hours a day whereas</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.270" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">reflecting sunlight only works during</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.440" end="01:16:50.940" style="s2">the day when there&#39;s actually sunlight</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:52.740" style="s2">coming in so right away you have a</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.940" end="01:16:54.240" style="s2">change in the diurnal cycle that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.740" end="01:16:56.280" style="s2">of important I think most people</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.240" end="01:16:58.410" style="s2">understand this from you know if you go</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.280" end="01:17:00.420" style="s2">to the desert at night for example as</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.410" end="01:17:02.520" style="s2">soon as it gets dark it gets quite cold</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.420" end="01:17:05.150" style="s2">in the desert because of clear sky and</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.520" end="01:17:07.470" style="s2">the desert radiates heat back to space</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.150" end="01:17:08.970" style="s2">whereas if it&#39;s cloudy in the desert it</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.470" end="01:17:12.350" style="s2">actually stays warm at night and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.970" end="01:17:13.830" style="s2">because the clouds add a lot of creative</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.350" end="01:17:15.990" style="s2">absorption of</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.830" end="01:17:18.660" style="s2">group of infrared radiation and it stays</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.990" end="01:17:20.670" style="s2">a lot warmer at night it happens in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.660" end="01:17:22.740" style="s2">wintertime here in Boston to the very</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.670" end="01:17:25.740" style="s2">cold cold nights happen when it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.740" end="01:17:28.590" style="s2">clear whereas when it&#39;s more stormy you</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.740" end="01:17:30.630" style="s2">don&#39;t actually get that cold so at first</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.590" end="01:17:32.310" style="s2">glance you know they don&#39;t actually it</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.630" end="01:17:34.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fix the problem and actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.310" end="01:17:36.210" style="s2">reflecting sunlight doesn&#39;t cancel out</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.410" end="01:17:38.580" style="s2">more absorption of infrared radiation</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.210" end="01:17:40.740" style="s2">from greenhouse gases what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.580" end="01:17:42.990" style="s2">is when you put it in a climate model it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.740" end="01:17:45.000" style="s2">works a lot better than you expect it</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.990" end="01:17:47.280" style="s2">actually works pretty well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.000" end="01:17:49.230" style="s2">perfect it doesn&#39;t perfectly cancel out</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:51.360" style="s2">the increase in greenhouse gases and</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.230" end="01:17:55.500" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting what I call</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.360" end="01:17:57.540" style="s2">asymmetric effects for example plants if</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.500" end="01:18:00.210" style="s2">you increased carbon dioxide level and</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.540" end="01:18:03.330" style="s2">and put reflective particles in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.210" end="01:18:06.270" style="s2">stratosphere to reflect sunlight to make</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.330" end="01:18:08.430" style="s2">it the temperature uniform you could do</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.270" end="01:18:10.890" style="s2">that but it turns out plants respond in</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.430" end="01:18:13.170" style="s2">interesting ways trees and plants</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.890" end="01:18:15.330" style="s2">actually in response to the higher</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.170" end="01:18:17.670" style="s2">levels of carbon dioxide they actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.330" end="01:18:19.800" style="s2">close their stomata the holes in their</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.670" end="01:18:22.470" style="s2">leaves and so they actually evaporate</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.800" end="01:18:24.870" style="s2">less water and so they actually change</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.470" end="01:18:26.580" style="s2">the water cycle substantially in</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.870" end="01:18:28.020" style="s2">response to the higher co2 because they</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.580" end="01:18:31.650" style="s2">are affected by the higher carbon</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.020" end="01:18:33.060" style="s2">dioxide levels as well and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.650" end="01:18:36.840" style="s2">some interesting effects that you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.060" end="01:18:40.470" style="s2">to be very careful about so it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.840" end="01:18:43.560" style="s2">that in general every place is probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.470" end="01:18:46.890" style="s2">better off if you were to magically</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.560" end="01:18:48.390" style="s2">solar Geoengineer the planet as opposed</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.890" end="01:18:51.870" style="s2">to just letting carbon dioxide levels</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.390" end="01:18:54.360" style="s2">rise but that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.870" end="01:18:56.430" style="s2">some big changes in some places that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.360" end="01:18:58.020" style="s2">number one the second thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.430" end="01:19:00.420" style="s2">really important to understand though</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.020" end="01:19:02.550" style="s2">and I think this is a good way of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.420" end="01:19:04.160" style="s2">thinking about it this is why Jim I</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.550" end="01:19:07.260" style="s2">don&#39;t like calling it a techno fix</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.160" end="01:19:09.030" style="s2">because it&#39;s not a fix I think a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.260" end="01:19:13.140" style="s2">analogy for it is actually something</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.030" end="01:19:15.450" style="s2">more like narcotics morphine for example</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.140" end="01:19:18.540" style="s2">you know narcotics can be a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.450" end="01:19:21.330" style="s2">important pain management medication if</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.540" end="01:19:23.620" style="s2">you&#39;re having major surgery say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.330" end="01:19:27.160" style="s2">having major abdominal surgery for</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.620" end="01:19:29.980" style="s2">condition Jim you would want some</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.160" end="01:19:31.000" style="s2">painkillers during the surgery right</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.980" end="01:19:33.100" style="s2">anesthesia</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.000" end="01:19:36.010" style="s2">you know you&#39;ll take that morphine any</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.100" end="01:19:40.870" style="s2">day because having the surgery without</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.010" end="01:19:43.420" style="s2">any anesthesia would be excruciating but</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.870" end="01:19:45.340" style="s2">if you only take the anesthesia if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.420" end="01:19:47.560" style="s2">only take the morphine and never</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.340" end="01:19:49.420" style="s2">actually have the surgery that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.560" end="01:19:52.660" style="s2">probably not a very good strategy either</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.420" end="01:19:54.460" style="s2">like morphine solar geoengineering can</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.660" end="01:19:56.140" style="s2">be very addicting that is once you start</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.460" end="01:19:58.270" style="s2">it you&#39;re kind of obliged to keep it</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.140" end="01:20:00.130" style="s2">going because if you stop it on a very</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.270" end="01:20:04.090" style="s2">short timescale the earth would have</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.130" end="01:20:06.790" style="s2">broccoli warm up because now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.090" end="01:20:10.300" style="s2">really far from equilibrium and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.790" end="01:20:11.650" style="s2">would be terrifying so let&#39;s just be</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.300" end="01:20:14.980" style="s2">clear on what we&#39;re talking about we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.650" end="01:20:18.090" style="s2">talking about a not a techno fix we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.980" end="01:20:22.410" style="s2">talking about potentially a techno</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.090" end="01:20:25.900" style="s2">tourniquet that is going to take away</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.410" end="01:20:30.520" style="s2">potentially some of the pain not all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.900" end="01:20:32.850" style="s2">it but some of the pain but it creates a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.520" end="01:20:35.250" style="s2">variety of new problems and</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.850" end="01:20:38.380" style="s2">fundamentally doesn&#39;t solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.250" end="01:20:40.360" style="s2">now there are many people who are</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.380" end="01:20:42.520" style="s2">opposed to even thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.360" end="01:20:45.310" style="s2">issue but the topic of - solar</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.520" end="01:20:47.620" style="s2">geoengineering because they say that</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.310" end="01:20:49.810" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna delay action if people think</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.620" end="01:20:51.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a techno fix then they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.810" end="01:20:54.130" style="s2">feel the pressure to reduce co2</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.250" end="01:20:55.780" style="s2">emissions I personally feel that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.130" end="01:20:59.890" style="s2">really short-sighted I actually think</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.780" end="01:21:02.230" style="s2">it&#39;s really important to think about</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.890" end="01:21:04.000" style="s2">this deeply because again I think the</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.230" end="01:21:07.150" style="s2">timescale of climate change is so long</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.000" end="01:21:10.180" style="s2">that I think it&#39;s gonna be very tempting</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.150" end="01:21:12.820" style="s2">for some either consortium of countries</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.180" end="01:21:14.440" style="s2">or individual countries to consider</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.820" end="01:21:16.570" style="s2">deploying a system of tilt or to</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.440" end="01:21:18.280" style="s2">engineering sometime this century I</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.570" end="01:21:20.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know who&#39;s gonna do it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.280" end="01:21:22.420" style="s2">know how it&#39;s gonna get done but I feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.920" end="01:21:24.820" style="s2">like as a scientist as a climate</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.420" end="01:21:26.950" style="s2">scientist I have a responsibility to</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.820" end="01:21:29.530" style="s2">think very carefully through how it</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.950" end="01:21:31.480" style="s2">might be done especially to think about</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.530" end="01:21:32.800" style="s2">all the bad ways of doing it and already</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.480" end="01:21:35.440" style="s2">I think we&#39;ve learned something for</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.800" end="01:21:36.430" style="s2">example in the 60s through even just a</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.440" end="01:21:37.930" style="s2">few years ago</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.430" end="01:21:39.730" style="s2">we were talking about sulfur because</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.930" end="01:21:41.350" style="s2">that&#39;s how volcanoes can cool the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.730" end="01:21:44.290" style="s2">climate when a big volcanic eruption</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.350" end="01:21:45.400" style="s2">happens sulfur gets emitted in sulfur</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.290" end="01:21:48.610" style="s2">dioxide gets emitted into the</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.400" end="01:21:50.980" style="s2">stratosphere and it turns into sulfate</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.610" end="01:21:52.930" style="s2">aerosols that reflect sunlight it can</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.980" end="01:21:55.060" style="s2">cool the climate a little bit and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.930" end="01:21:56.350" style="s2">known this for a long time so you could</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.060" end="01:21:58.660" style="s2">think of this as almost artificial</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.350" end="01:22:00.040" style="s2">volcanoes people could scatter sulfur</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.660" end="01:22:01.900" style="s2">into the stratosphere and it would turn</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.040" end="01:22:04.150" style="s2">into sulfate aerosols and cool the</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.900" end="01:22:06.670" style="s2">climate the problem is that it might</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.150" end="01:22:08.350" style="s2">also affect we think sulfur in this way</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.670" end="01:22:11.200" style="s2">might also affect the ozone layer and if</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.350" end="01:22:14.410" style="s2">you sustained injections of sulfur for a</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.200" end="01:22:15.820" style="s2">long time not just once for from a</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.410" end="01:22:18.100" style="s2">volcano but if you actually did this</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.820" end="01:22:18.420" style="s2">perennial II for a very long period of</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.100" end="01:22:22.180" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.420" end="01:22:23.650" style="s2">you would potentially erode the ozone</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.180" end="01:22:26.590" style="s2">layer that protects us from UV radiation</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.650" end="01:22:29.110" style="s2">that would be a very bad thing and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.590" end="01:22:31.450" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned that really from research</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.110" end="01:22:33.220" style="s2">on solar to engineering I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.450" end="01:22:34.930" style="s2">really important example of why it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.220" end="01:22:37.420" style="s2">important to think about this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.930" end="01:22:40.750" style="s2">just how to do it it&#39;s also how not to</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.420" end="01:22:43.120" style="s2">do it because you know some political</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.750" end="01:22:44.860" style="s2">leaders somewhere sometime in the next</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.120" end="01:22:47.350" style="s2">hundred years I think it&#39;s gonna find</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.860" end="01:22:49.930" style="s2">this very tempting because it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.350" end="01:22:51.690" style="s2">relatively inexpensive relative to</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.930" end="01:22:55.930" style="s2">changing the energy system of the world</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.690" end="01:22:59.170" style="s2">now you know to say that it&#39;s not a fix</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.930" end="01:23:02.650" style="s2">I think that&#39;s really important but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.170" end="01:23:04.480" style="s2">also think about this the way Churchill</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.650" end="01:23:06.430" style="s2">described democracy remember he said</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.480" end="01:23:08.170" style="s2">something like you know democracy is the</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.430" end="01:23:11.950" style="s2">worst form of government ever invented</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.170" end="01:23:14.020" style="s2">except for the alternative and I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.950" end="01:23:16.440" style="s2">of the same with solar geoengineering</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.020" end="01:23:20.710" style="s2">Solar geoengineering is a terrible</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.440" end="01:23:22.810" style="s2">arrogant way of fixing a more</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.710" end="01:23:26.560" style="s2">fundamental problem in the earth system</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.810" end="01:23:29.260" style="s2">and in the human system it&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.560" end="01:23:32.080" style="s2">crazy terrible idea engineering the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.260" end="01:23:34.420" style="s2">climate for every person every living</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.080" end="01:23:36.400" style="s2">thing on the planet it&#39;s terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.420" end="01:23:38.790" style="s2">and yet it may be better than the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.400" end="01:23:42.420" style="s2">alternative and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.790" end="01:23:44.650" style="s2">important for people to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.420" end="01:23:46.690" style="s2">absolutely what are some of the risks</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.650" end="01:23:48.550" style="s2">involved you know because it was just a</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.690" end="01:23:50.769" style="s2">magic thing we puts you know I remember</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.550" end="01:23:52.119" style="s2">some of the earlier suggestions oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.769" end="01:23:53.860" style="s2">we had a little sulfur to the diesel</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.119" end="01:23:55.329" style="s2">fuel let the Jets just do their thing</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.860" end="01:23:56.979" style="s2">but as you point out that&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.329" end="01:23:59.469" style="s2">idea but let&#39;s say some of these other</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.979" end="01:24:02.019" style="s2">ones that we don&#39;t have any known stupid</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.469" end="01:24:05.010" style="s2">risks about what are the systemic risks</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.019" end="01:24:07.090" style="s2">the complex system risks first of all</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.010" end="01:24:09.039" style="s2">doing this in a model is very different</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.090" end="01:24:12.309" style="s2">than operationalizing this for the real</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.039" end="01:24:15.570" style="s2">world figuring out how to inject</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.309" end="01:24:19.780" style="s2">particles into the stratosphere in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.570" end="01:24:24.300" style="s2">systematic way that safely engineers the</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.300" end="01:24:28.659" style="s2">because this particles mix we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.949" end="01:24:30.519" style="s2">control them right it&#39;s a global what</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.659" end="01:24:32.619" style="s2">you&#39;re affecting everything you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.519" end="01:24:34.420" style="s2">isolate it you can&#39;t just do this</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.619" end="01:24:36.579" style="s2">for the US so you can&#39;t just do this for</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.420" end="01:24:38.949" style="s2">China it&#39;s much more complicated than</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.579" end="01:24:41.519" style="s2">that technically that&#39;s a challenge</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.949" end="01:24:44.320" style="s2">really doing this in a consistent way</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.519" end="01:24:47.380" style="s2">number two the governance problems are</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.320" end="01:24:49.479" style="s2">enormous may be insurmountable think</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.380" end="01:24:51.489" style="s2">about who gets to control it often when</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.479" end="01:24:53.110" style="s2">we talk about this in the u.s. we just</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.489" end="01:24:56.800" style="s2">presume them as the current global</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.110" end="01:24:58.090" style="s2">superpower that we&#39;re in charge but do</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.800" end="01:25:00.340" style="s2">you really think that all the countries</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.090" end="01:25:03.309" style="s2">of the world are comfortable with</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.340" end="01:25:05.469" style="s2">somebody like our current president in</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.309" end="01:25:08.769" style="s2">charge of the thermostat for the whole</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.469" end="01:25:10.630" style="s2">globe and who gets to decide and by the</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.769" end="01:25:13.440" style="s2">way whatever country or group of</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.630" end="01:25:16.349" style="s2">countries is in charge of this system</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.440" end="01:25:20.199" style="s2">first of all if anything goes wrong</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.349" end="01:25:21.969" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get blamed and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.199" end="01:25:24.820" style="s2">other thing if there&#39;s a weather-related</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.969" end="01:25:27.389" style="s2">disaster whether it was actually caused</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.820" end="01:25:30.940" style="s2">by the geoengineering system or not</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.389" end="01:25:31.329" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna get blamed right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.940" end="01:25:33.280" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.329" end="01:25:35.050" style="s2">just like hurricanes are being blamed on</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.280" end="01:25:36.699" style="s2">global warming and well global warming</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.050" end="01:25:38.559" style="s2">you have some small part about it most</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.699" end="01:25:41.050" style="s2">of hurricanes are driven by shorter term</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.559" end="01:25:43.479" style="s2">cycles of ocean circulation but people</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.050" end="01:25:44.979" style="s2">can&#39;t separate those things so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.479" end="01:25:47.860" style="s2">gonna get blamed if you actually do</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.979" end="01:25:51.249" style="s2">engineer the climate you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.860" end="01:25:53.230" style="s2">an awesome responsibility and people are</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.249" end="01:25:56.440" style="s2">gonna blame you for everything</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.230" end="01:25:58.090" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of daunting and think</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.440" end="01:26:00.520" style="s2">about how we would feel if China decided</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.090" end="01:26:03.160" style="s2">to do this unilaterally would we really</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.520" end="01:26:05.950" style="s2">be comfortable with China having control</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.160" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">over our climate what if there was a big</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.950" end="01:26:10.870" style="s2">drought in the u.s. like happened in</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:13.750" style="s2">2012 major drought 50% of us counties</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.870" end="01:26:15.640" style="s2">and emergency drought conditions would</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.750" end="01:26:17.620" style="s2">we really be comfortable having China</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.640" end="01:26:21.370" style="s2">with they&#39;re controlling the knobs</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.620" end="01:26:22.690" style="s2">that&#39;s I think the answer is no of</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.370" end="01:26:25.030" style="s2">course that&#39;s part of the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.690" end="01:26:26.590" style="s2">that you know we&#39;re tweaking a complex</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.030" end="01:26:28.660" style="s2">system with circulations within</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.590" end="01:26:31.060" style="s2">circulations within circulation so even</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.660" end="01:26:32.860" style="s2">if we do a perfect job of there will be</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.060" end="01:26:35.260" style="s2">surprises there will be surprises for</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.860" end="01:26:37.570" style="s2">sure yeah and local local effects you</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.260" end="01:26:39.580" style="s2">know and it may work right for Argentina</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.570" end="01:26:42.160" style="s2">but be a disaster for the Midwest of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.580" end="01:26:43.600" style="s2">United States or vice versa and yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.160" end="01:26:45.700" style="s2">we already know that to some extent for</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.600" end="01:26:48.160" style="s2">example research has shown that if you</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.700" end="01:26:50.050" style="s2">globally Geoengineer the climate things</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.160" end="01:26:51.940" style="s2">like in for example in Indonesia the</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.050" end="01:26:55.620" style="s2">Western warm pool of the Pacific</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.940" end="01:26:59.590" style="s2">Indonesia is gonna get drier and so</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.620" end="01:27:01.900" style="s2">suppose there were rigorously verifiable</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.590" end="01:27:04.330" style="s2">impacts on particular regions or</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.900" end="01:27:06.700" style="s2">countries so you knew that Indonesia was</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.330" end="01:27:09.370" style="s2">gonna get drier as you did this with the</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.700" end="01:27:10.300" style="s2">US have to pay compensation to Indonesia</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.370" end="01:27:13.480" style="s2">how would that work</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.300" end="01:27:14.860" style="s2">I mean here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.480" end="01:27:16.930" style="s2">climate change I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.860" end="01:27:19.330" style="s2">this in the context of how humans are</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.930" end="01:27:21.370" style="s2">likely to respond to the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.330" end="01:27:23.830" style="s2">climate challenge and the energy</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.370" end="01:27:26.489" style="s2">challenge and and I&#39;ve got to say I</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.830" end="01:27:29.800" style="s2">think the one part that scientists often</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.489" end="01:27:34.800" style="s2">underestimate about humans is their</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.800" end="01:27:38.640" style="s2">ability to adapt to local challenges</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.800" end="01:27:42.460" style="s2">we&#39;re incredibly ingeniously</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.640" end="01:27:44.770" style="s2">innovative and scrappy when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.460" end="01:27:47.140" style="s2">fixing problems that affect us that</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.770" end="01:27:49.030" style="s2">affect our communities you know when it</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.140" end="01:27:51.040" style="s2">comes to long timescales we&#39;re terrible</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.030" end="01:27:54.010" style="s2">and there&#39;s good evolutionary reasons</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.040" end="01:27:56.620" style="s2">for that and the same thing with</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.010" end="01:27:59.830" style="s2">collective action we&#39;re really bad at</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.620" end="01:28:01.450" style="s2">global stuff we&#39;re tribal you know we</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.830" end="01:28:04.300" style="s2">see it in primates oh we see it in</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.450" end="01:28:06.550" style="s2">chimpanzees we tend to be tribal we</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.300" end="01:28:08.619" style="s2">don&#39;t tend to cooperate very well</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.550" end="01:28:10.449" style="s2">globally but here&#39;s the interesting</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.619" end="01:28:12.040" style="s2">thing climate change is a challenge the</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.449" end="01:28:17.110" style="s2">likes of which we&#39;ve never experienced</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.040" end="01:28:19.030" style="s2">before and I have a feeling that all of</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.110" end="01:28:22.389" style="s2">this is gonna result in a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.030" end="01:28:23.949" style="s2">interesting innovation not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.389" end="01:28:28.119" style="s2">in energy systems although I hope that</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.949" end="01:28:30.429" style="s2">happens also but I am thinking about how</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.119" end="01:28:33.280" style="s2">you know if everything I know about</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.429" end="01:28:34.840" style="s2">climate change is right it means that</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.280" end="01:28:37.059" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna experience a lot of climate</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.840" end="01:28:39.820" style="s2">change not just in my lifetime</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.059" end="01:28:41.880" style="s2">whatever&#39;s left of it but my children</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.820" end="01:28:45.340" style="s2">and my grandchildren and beyond and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.880" end="01:28:47.139" style="s2">means that the reality of their impacts</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.340" end="01:28:49.510" style="s2">of climate change are gonna Drive</p>
