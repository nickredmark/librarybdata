<p begin="00:00:02.320" end="00:00:06.799" style="s2">i am trying something new instead of me</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.799" end="00:00:09.440" style="s2">just winging it i&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.799" end="00:00:10.880" style="s2">a presentation which will help keep me</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.440" end="00:00:12.880" style="s2">on track and also give a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.880" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">visual representation so today i want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.880" end="00:00:19.279" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">this concept that i can see in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.279" end="00:00:23.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite a dichotomy but i like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:26.480" style="s2">sometimes make things into a dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.359" end="00:00:28.320" style="s2">in order to um showcase them better so</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.480" end="00:00:29.920" style="s2">for every individual that&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.320" end="00:00:32.559" style="s2">they are generally either an</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.920" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">overestimator or an underestimator</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.559" end="00:00:36.000" style="s2">you want to see the juxtaposition of an</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:37.600" style="s2">overestimator you would look at trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.000" end="00:00:40.399" style="s2">someone who thinks they&#39;re the best at</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.600" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">everything versus um i like to put</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.399" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">myself in the underestimator category</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">because there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">there isn&#39;t necessarily a celebrity one</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.640" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">because we don&#39;t put them</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:50.000" style="s2">in power somebody who is honest about</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">their traits and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.000" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">or more so underestimates them and so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:56.840" style="s2">this is the presentation</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">for that it&#39;s gonna add this to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.840" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">screen</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:04.239" style="s2">go over here and present it so over and</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:06.799" style="s2">underestimators and why it matters not</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.239" end="00:01:09.439" style="s2">just because it hurts my feelings</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.799" end="00:01:10.799" style="s2">so populations are normal not people</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.439" end="00:01:12.240" style="s2">which of course isn&#39;t quite true the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.799" end="00:01:13.760" style="s2">reason it&#39;s called a normal curve is</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.240" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s the normal distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.760" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">normal people</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:18.640" style="s2">um it&#39;s what normally happens in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">population when you have a continuous</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.640" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">trait</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">so that is something that cannot be not</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:24.159" style="s2">like male female where you&#39;re generally</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">either one or the other</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.159" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;s um a continuous trait right so</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:32.000" style="s2">weight you could be 120 pounds 120.1.2.3</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">right it&#39;s continuous</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.000" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">height is also continuous and grades</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">we kind of do a b c d e somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">uh it&#39;s actually zero to one hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">percent and also falls along continuum</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">and sometimes they make them fit the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">bell curve but generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">anything that is continuous has this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.680" end="00:01:52.320" style="s2">this bell-like curve this normal curve</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">to it as a population we cannot all</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.320" end="00:01:56.000" style="s2">bunch to one side we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">have a distribution we are going to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">some of us</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">fall along along the one tail</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:03.759" style="s2">and what some of us fall along the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">tail and the vast majority of us are</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.759" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">going to be in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">that is why this is big here is this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.120" style="s2">the number of people at that trait level</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:12.640" style="s2">and this is the the trait levels this</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.120" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">would be like extremely short this would</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.640" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">be extremely tall this would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">extremely light this would be extremely</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">heavy</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">and this would be the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:21.920" style="s2">there i&#39;m hoping you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">see my my cursor on there but i will see</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.920" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">on the replay</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">so i want to introduce you to blue bob</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">and red ruby</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">right here they happen to be overlapped</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">which is why they look purple</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">so they are actually identical human</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">beings nearly they have the exact</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">same skill level at nearly everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:42.959" style="s2">the difference being</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">that bob blue bob overestimates himself</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.959" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">and red ruby</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">underestimates herself so blue bob is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.440" style="s2">overestimator and so he slides further</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">along this which this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.440" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">positive trait this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">negative trait</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">she thinks she&#39;s worse than she actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">is he thinks he&#39;s better they actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">both sit</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">somewhere in the middle here so</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">you are in charge of hiring someone you</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">get red ruby and blue bob&#39;s resumes</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:10.080" style="s2">red ruby describes herself as adequate</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:11.760" style="s2">at a certain skill level bob says he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.080" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">the best at that skill level</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.760" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">again i&#39;m juxtapositioning these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">these are extreme examples of over and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:17.599" style="s2">under estimators</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:20.159" style="s2">ruby thinks she gets along with most</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:21.920" style="s2">people bob says everybody every single</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.159" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">person he&#39;s ever encountered has loved</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.920" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">red ruby says you know she rarely gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">sick maybe a couple of sick days</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">per per year blue bob says he never gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.360" style="s2">and so who are you gonna hire i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">hands down nearly everyone is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.360" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">hire blue bob over red ruby</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:39.680" style="s2">but who&#39;s going to actually do a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">job if you hire</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.680" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">both of them and they have the exact</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">same skill level well no matter how hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:46.400" style="s2">ruby tries she&#39;s never going to feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:48.319" style="s2">quite as adequate</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.400" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">so she&#39;s gonna keep trying harder and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.319" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">harder whereas bob feels like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s already good he&#39;s awesome he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">better than everyone else so why would</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:03:57.439" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">why would he put in extra effort ruby</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.439" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">he&#39;s gonna he&#39;s gonna take extra long</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.480" style="s2">breaks because he sees himself as better</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">than everyone else he&#39;s doing more work</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.480" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">so he&#39;s entitled to those longer breaks</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">whereas ruby&#39;s going to cut her break</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:09.519" style="s2">short come in earlier to make up for</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">that perceived difference that she</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.519" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:15.200" style="s2">she&#39;s going to be extra diligent and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">make up for the perceived mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.200" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">blue bob&#39;s gonna leave everything to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">last minute and make mistakes and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">blame them on other people probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:21.919" style="s2">because he won&#39;t even see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:24.479" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.919" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">um he&#39;s not going to ever seek outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.479" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">advice because there are no</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">outside advisors that are more competent</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">than he is</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">whereas red ruby&#39;s going to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">be learning and gaining new skills based</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">on her</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">underestimation so i just want a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:38.320" style="s2">examples here</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">they&#39;re both cooking dinner for a friend</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.320" end="00:04:41.759" style="s2">ruby feels inadequate and so she looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">up how to cook a five</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.759" end="00:04:45.759" style="s2">course meal and cooks this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">gourmet meal bob on the other hand is</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">like i&#39;m the best cook</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">and just i can follow a recipe mix mac</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">and cheese</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">and this is what they present to their</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">friends again this is assuming they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">the same cookie level</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">but ruby is an underestimator and bob&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">an overestimator</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.199" style="s2">this is they both go to an art class and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:05.600" style="s2">do an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.199" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">average self-portrait but when ruby</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.600" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">looks at hers</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">she sees this stick figure and when bob</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.479" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">looks at his he sees a work of art</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">this is they both have the same skill</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">sets they both have the same information</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">that is they each have this green this</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">green slot</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">so they each know about five percent of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">the total knowledge of 100 of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">could be known that all humans know to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:30.160" style="s2">all together collectively about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.160" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">they know five percent but ruby feels</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">like she only</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.600" style="s2">knows one percent out of this big blue</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:40.720" style="s2">circle whereas bob</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.600" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">feels like he he knows 25 of it he feels</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.720" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">he&#39;s pretty confident but they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.560" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">right so why this matters is very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.560" end="00:05:53.440" style="s2">it comes into the dunning-kruger effect</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">that most people didn&#39;t krieger effect i</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.440" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">feel like i should have looked up an</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">actual definition because i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">butcher it a little bit because i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:02.080" style="s2">underestimator</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.960" style="s2">that when you first encounter something</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.080" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">you go through this</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.960" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">this peak of stupid or you have this</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">overestimation of confidence that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">know everything and then you realize how</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">big that circle is that you could know</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">and you fall into this valley of despair</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">that you will never know everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">and then you slowly can crawl your way</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.160" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">out in the slope of enlightenment but if</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.759" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">you look at these confidence levels</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.880" style="s2">the same and so if you&#39;re hiring someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re here in</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.880" end="00:06:26.560" style="s2">the plateau of sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">after the slope of enlightenment or that</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">they&#39;re here and most people</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">are here that are over estimators</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">whereas</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">because the underestimators fall to this</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:37.840" style="s2">valley of despair really quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:40.880" style="s2">then work really hard to climb out</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.840" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">um they&#39;re gonna be more more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:43.440" style="s2">gain</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">the actual competence that is needed now</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.440" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">in this example i tried to make it so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">that ruby and bob are the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">so they&#39;re going to have the same level</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:51.919" style="s2">of competence but they&#39;re starting at</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">the same and the point is is being an</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.919" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">underestimator makes you do more work</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">than being an overestimator so why does</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">this matter</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">it matters hugely because of this first</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">point we hire the overestimators</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">who will never be confident at doing the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">job</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">we should have hired ruby not bob but</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">we&#39;re always going to hire bob based on</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:14.080" style="s2">his resume</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">we judge everyone as overestimators we</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.080" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">that becomes the standard so if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t lie</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">and and a pad their resume they&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">going to get hired so it forces them to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">become an overestimator even when</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">they&#39;re an underestimator</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">which makes them have even more of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">um imposter complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">same with on a first date right if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">show up and you act like yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">you show your flaws</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:36.319" style="s2">they&#39;re going to assume you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">because that&#39;s what how you normally</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.319" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">most people show up on a first date</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">and so they&#39;re going to extrapolate that</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">if you&#39;re this weird on a first date you</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:44.560" style="s2">must be even way weirder</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">six months in because they assume</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.560" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s an understanding or</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s gonna show up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">be on their best behavior some of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">don&#39;t do that on first dates</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:54.400" style="s2">we can distinguish between those of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">same level of confidence going back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.400" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">the previous slide that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">that that difference</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">and those who lie outright lie right</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">just say they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">they&#39;re the best at it they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:05.840" style="s2">overestimators even overestimate their</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.840" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">right um or they just have that um</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">bravado that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">that ego that tells them they are better</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">than everyone else even though</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:19.759" style="s2">the actual metrics don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">show that but this is what our entire</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.759" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">society is based on so we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.919" style="s2">going to put the overestimators in power</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">either those that believe they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.919" end="00:08:28.479" style="s2">like they could take a lie detector and</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">say they&#39;re the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.479" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">or those who are lying to say that</p>

<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">we&#39;re putting people who are incompetent</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.599" end="00:08:36.000" style="s2">in power because it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:43.279" style="s2">who have the confidence it&#39;s like the</p>
