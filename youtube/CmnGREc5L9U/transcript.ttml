<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.640" style="s2">so today</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">i want to talk about relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.640" end="00:03:28.239" style="s2">um the sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">and that touches on identity it touches</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.239" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">on a bunch of different interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of a shift from what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.400" style="s2">last time last time was much more you</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">know metaphysical and kind of a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.400" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">cerebral exercise about</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">how we how we look at what is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">and what is reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:45.200" style="s2">this is also talking about reality but</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">it&#39;s talking much more than about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.200" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">subjective aspects of reality</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">um let me zoom in just a little bit all</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.239" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">so um so let&#39;s get right into it so um</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">i think typically when we think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:02.239" style="s2">relationships um</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">we think about them as okay this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.239" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">connective thing between</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:07.760" style="s2">cells or between individuals or between</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">an object and another object we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.760" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">about the relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">um we have with each other we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">about the relationships between people</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">the relationship between a car and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:18.239" style="s2">road</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">or a spacecraft and the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.239" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">field around it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">you know we talk about relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">between two things between two objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">um and you can draw it very simply like</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">this as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:30.560" style="s2">what we call a node link diagram so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:31.759" style="s2">have nodes and the relationships are the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.560" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">links between them</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.759" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">but when we construct it in this way the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">is entirely it&#39;s almost it&#39;s almost hard</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">to see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">until you look at it um but there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">this extreme prejudice towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">the self the atomic selves and objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">as being primary they&#39;re the primary</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">things they&#39;re the nodes i mean even in</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t call it a link of nodes we call</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">it node link diagram</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">right even our emphasis in the word</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:01.759" style="s2">order really shows you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">the the perspective we have on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.759" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">which is that there are these nodes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">and we can if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.120" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">physics or we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.039" style="s2">psychology we can talk about the selves</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">or the nodes as atomic things under</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.039" end="00:05:13.120" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:14.080" style="s2">um and and then we can talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.120" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">relationship to other things the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.080" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">relationship is secondary right</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">and so i would like when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">inverting this view</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.080" style="s2">um what i mean is what if we view the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:26.639" style="s2">relationships as the first class</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.080" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">thing what if it&#39;s actually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.639" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">atoms</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">and then there&#39;s some interaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">between atoms but the interaction</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">the field is the primary thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">okay now does that make sense like like</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:39.759" style="s2">it&#39;s a different kind of view i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.759" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">obviously just having seen some peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">writing uh i know peter understands</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">this um concept right this idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:49.520" style="s2">we actually flip this around</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">and we don&#39;t view the atomized</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.520" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">individuals we don&#39;t view</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:57.440" style="s2">the the car as an object on the road</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t just view a planet in the space</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.440" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">of the gravitational field we flip</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">around we talk about the gravitational</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">field as the primary thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">that through its action pushes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:07.520" style="s2">smooshes a bunch of things together to</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">form planets</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.520" end="00:06:10.960" style="s2">all of a sudden i mean it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">physics it&#39;s the same stuff and yet</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.960" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">it completely flips the world on its</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">head</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">if you view yourself not as an agent and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">a self that has relationships</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:23.039" style="s2">but rather you are the emergent result</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:27.039" style="s2">of all of the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.039" end="00:06:27.280" style="s2">around you it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.039" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.280" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of interesting right and a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">relationship is just a tube right in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">this way it&#39;s a tube</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">with inputs and outputs at either end</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s a binding</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">between two different things or</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">if you have a whole lot of them it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:42.400" style="s2">field it&#39;s like the ocean it&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.400" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">it&#39;s a binding energy that creates</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">atomized</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">locations and so if you then um take</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">you can sort of see the self as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.000" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">region</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">as defined by relationships so if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">are a baby</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">and imagine i don&#39;t know how many people</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">here have have children i know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">some um</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a wide variety of uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">age groups represented here</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">at the stoa but as i was raising my</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">child i began to realize</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">well i have two children a 10 year old</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">and a six-year-old now but i began to</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:16.800" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">how much my language and my interaction</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.800" end="00:07:20.240" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">was explicitly creating a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.240" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">that defined selfhood for them</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:28.960" style="s2">um and in fact if you look at childhood</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">like early childhood psychology and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.960" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">look at some of these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">you can define that like the pij uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">scale of of um</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">of infant development there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">there&#39;s an early stage where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">just a blob of like neurons of meat</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">right and then eventually the neurons</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">get a sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">oh there&#39;s persistence of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">constant concept of object persistence</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">like oh when a thing moves behind</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">another thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">it&#39;s still the same thing so their brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">and their visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">cortexes are sort of still wiring up</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">this basic level</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.520" style="s2">at a perceptual level and over time they</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">develop a theory of action i can move my</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.520" end="00:08:03.039" style="s2">hands i can suck on my thumb</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">i can cry and i get milk right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.039" end="00:08:06.960" style="s2">all these things</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:09.360" style="s2">but as they become um as they really</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.960" end="00:08:11.599" style="s2">develop a sense of of coherent self</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.360" end="00:08:14.080" style="s2">the parents around them are the ones</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.599" end="00:08:16.000" style="s2">that then define the social self and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.080" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">begin to give them a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.000" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">i am your caregiver i or i am your</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">punisher or i define what you can do</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">and and there&#39;s like this so even from a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">very early age</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:27.440" style="s2">as humans we&#39;re molded by our</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.160" style="s2">interactions with the the caregivers</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.440" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">around us</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.160" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">and as we go into late a childhood into</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">teenage year</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">time frame that&#39;s when we start to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">develop</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">an inner or innate self you can think of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:40.719" style="s2">this as the id</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:42.640" style="s2">right and then projecting the ego and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">that&#39;s back pressure against the social</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.640" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">cells coming in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">and of course this comes to a head in</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">our teenage years as we as we exceed</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.279" style="s2">and break and push back on some of these</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.040" style="s2">relationships some of which have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.279" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">fundamental to us since we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.040" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">you know blobs of neurons and meat right</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">this idea that that selfhood is not an</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">atomic like it ends at my skin</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">okay myself certainly forces out into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">skin it&#39;s locally projected into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:08.160" style="s2">microphone which then goes out into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:09.920" style="s2">internet to all of you all</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.160" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">so myself is actually quite extended in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.920" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">the age of the internet but</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:16.320" style="s2">even if i were to think of myself as</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">just this physical body defined by skin</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.320" end="00:09:20.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a very very uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">impoverished view</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.160" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">because i&#39;m a social human being in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">modern world myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">my identity my avatar is actually uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">the the end points of a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">relations a lot of these um</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">these relationships and even here uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">before peter invited me here onto the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">stoa</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">i did not exist inside this social realm</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">now i do exist in the social realm</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">as a person as a sense maker but as a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">person who&#39;s been given the privilege of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">the platform to speak to all of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:47.440" style="s2">and so all of so many aspects and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">gained that now</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">part of my identity so all of these</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">different aspects of selfhood are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">actually defined by the relationships</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">that we allow to come in or that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">invest into it&#39;s an input output</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.120" style="s2">right if i do a terrible job at this</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:03.440" style="s2">right now if i completely just waste</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.120" end="00:10:05.440" style="s2">everyone&#39;s time and i&#39;m quite boring</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">and i add no value whatsoever you know i</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.440" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">probably won&#39;t be invited back right</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s an input and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">output there&#39;s expectations and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.399" style="s2">stress</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">stress is just the shifting of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.399" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">boundary of self</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">with it not not just but in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">social stress we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">as the the the the energy it takes to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">kind of shift</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:29.279" style="s2">um the the boundaries of stuff within</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:31.360" style="s2">all of these the social environment we</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.279" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">live in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.360" end="00:10:35.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:37.839" style="s2">way i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.279" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">kick this off was to invert the view of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.839" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">relationships from being just</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">a connective thing that atoms do to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">actually being</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">the field that actually makes atoms</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">possible that defines what the shape of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">the atom is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">so and this is um full disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">i i have a little like nerd out part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">me that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.800" style="s2">likes to look at chemistry and atomic</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">physics and to think about atoms</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.800" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">themselves in this way</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">that actually the cartesian newtonian to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:10.160" style="s2">bohr and rutherfordian model</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">of what we think of as an atom is um</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s quite literal it&#39;s like oh here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">the planet you know the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">nucleus of the atom electrons orbiting</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">except we know that it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">electrons orbiting it&#39;s a quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">you know electric uh quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">probability wave function that defines</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">what we&#39;re likely to find electrons</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">but if you start going to that more more</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">you realize wait it&#39;s just a giant</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">entangled quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">probability field and is there even</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:34.560" style="s2">electron unless we make a measurement on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.560" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">if we make a measure of a certain form</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">our measuring device gets entangled into</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">the field and so what the f</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.399" style="s2">is an atom is an electron is any of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.399" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting this blend</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:46.959" style="s2">between field to corpuscular or atomic</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">even in physics hard hard physics and</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">i&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">i&#39;m not a practicing physicist anymore</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:53.680" style="s2">but i did train as a physicist in</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:55.040" style="s2">college</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:56.639" style="s2">so what i&#39;m telling you for those who</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.040" end="00:11:56.959" style="s2">don&#39;t know physics there&#39;s nothing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.639" end="00:11:58.720" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.959" end="00:12:00.399" style="s2">getting all mumbo jumbo like quantum</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.720" end="00:12:02.079" style="s2">mysticism on you that&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">actually the way that quantum physicists</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.079" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">think about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:09.040" style="s2">they know that we don&#39;t actually have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">hard model of like here&#39;s exactly where</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.040" end="00:12:11.200" style="s2">the object is here&#39;s exactly where the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">electron is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.200" end="00:12:14.160" style="s2">we talk about as a mathematical wave</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">function that is the most proper way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.160" end="00:12:16.399" style="s2">talk about that&#39;s how we make lasers and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:17.920" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.399" end="00:12:20.240" style="s2">is because we think in those terms so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.920" end="00:12:22.399" style="s2">even in physics</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.240" end="00:12:24.399" style="s2">where we&#39;re where we most successfully</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.399" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">use the word atom and atomization</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.399" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">when it gets down to it the mechanics of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">interaction we have to use</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">wave theories and so here i&#39;m suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">that when we think about the relational</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:34.959" style="s2">dynamics between people in a social</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">environment and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.959" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">being humans which are not just you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">a proton or a neutron or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">that we can use a similar concept rather</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:43.120" style="s2">than seeing ourselves as atomic</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.120" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">see ourselves as zones of identity uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">zones of identity that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">um have pressure back pressure against</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">all of these different social</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.040" style="s2">relationships coming into us and one</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">thing i&#39;ll say about this that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.040" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">interesting is if you view this in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:01.440" style="s2">uh uh well i&#39;ll talk about this later in</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">the q a remind me to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.440" end="00:13:04.959" style="s2">celebrity and fame culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">okay if i forget but this directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.959" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">touches on</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">that idea of brands and celebrity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">fame culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">so anyway um so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">different way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">relationships but if we ask okay how are</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">relationships formed</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">if they&#39;re primal where do they come</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">from and</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:23.120" style="s2">and this touches on then</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">inter-subjective reality it touches on</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.120" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">because a relationship you know we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:28.959" style="s2">say we want to be primal</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:30.639" style="s2">but it does seem to have like things</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.959" end="00:13:32.160" style="s2">there need to be things relating to each</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.639" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">other to form a relationship don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.160" end="00:13:39.279" style="s2">doesn&#39;t there so um so there&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">uh document written by a guy named joe</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.279" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">edelman uh back in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">about conviviality and human</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:48.399" style="s2">relationships and um</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">just i mean really really fantastic um</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.399" end="00:13:50.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s actually google doc i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">know if you&#39;ll be able to find it if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.800" end="00:13:53.519" style="s2">search for it but i did link it here in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">this and i will upload</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t promise to upload the previous</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">presentation haven&#39;t yet i will upload</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">these presentations so you guys can</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">view the links but um but joe did this</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.720" style="s2">really wonderful analysis and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">did a lot of study on this stuff and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">looked at like</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">this question of where does our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">togetherness he was talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">not as just a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:13.279" style="s2">diatic relationship between two</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">individuals but just in general</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.279" end="00:14:18.079" style="s2">the social environment where does our</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.600" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">sense of togetherness come from</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.079" end="00:14:21.920" style="s2">and i thought this was a nice little</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:23.360" style="s2">chart to look at uh demographic affinity</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.920" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">or we could look at you know different</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.360" end="00:14:27.600" style="s2">kinds of um</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">labor relationships and then um what he</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.600" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">called simultaneous feeling down there</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">and he and he evolved from this</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">to um uh that evolves but he in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:38.959" style="s2">same document</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">he has this which then kind of narrows</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.959" end="00:14:42.399" style="s2">into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">that dyadic mode between two individuals</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.399" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">uh or you have two</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">two agents that do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">relationship how does a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">um and and he is ultimately identified</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">relationships requiring shared values to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">exist and and i talk about his trust</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">right so what is the origins of trust in</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:14:59.920" style="s2">human relationships</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:02.880" style="s2">these are really the building blocks</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.920" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">shared values and and building trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.880" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">and he talked about four different ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.800" style="s2">that we discover values</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:11.680" style="s2">and i have this is one of my mental</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.800" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">models that i love the most um he has a</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.680" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">if you look for joe edelman uh for</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:16.560" style="s2">social worlds</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:19.600" style="s2">he&#39;s got this brilliant write-up about</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.560" end="00:15:21.360" style="s2">that as well that that talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.600" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">at the end of the day what how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.360" end="00:15:24.399" style="s2">actually start to relate to people</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">and he identifies these four modes we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.399" end="00:15:28.880" style="s2">can have mutual appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:30.800" style="s2">so together we both go look at a piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.880" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">of art or together we both watch a tv</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.800" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">show</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">or we mutually we go both go and pet the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:37.199" style="s2">same dog you know it could be</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:38.480" style="s2">something there builds relationship</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.199" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">because there&#39;s mutual</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.480" end="00:15:42.320" style="s2">appreciation now we can also just talk</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">to each other just talking is</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">but talking does not mean using language</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:49.360" style="s2">as weapons talking is actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:52.240" style="s2">um so so you can that&#39;s another way to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.360" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">kind of build more trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.240" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">conflicts is another way to build trust</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">so i i tend to call trustful conflict</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">talking about this at the corporate</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">management level but</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">some people like to think that oh we</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:05.120" style="s2">want a safe space and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">everyone trusts each other means no</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.120" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">one&#39;s getting hurt and it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">no no that just means everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:12.560" style="s2">pretending to trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">actual trustful relationships are ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.560" end="00:16:15.279" style="s2">in which you can disagree and you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">the other person</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.279" end="00:16:18.399" style="s2">won&#39;t come at you in a different angle</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">so going back to that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.399" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">to the the previous slide here</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:25.519" style="s2">um trust means that people know how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:26.880" style="s2">stay in their lane</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.519" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re not they&#39;re going to stop at</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.880" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">the boundary where you want them to stop</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:33.040" style="s2">before it comes into damaging your inner</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">your inner self</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.040" end="00:16:37.279" style="s2">they respect your boundaries that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.000" style="s2">setting that&#39;s what trust means in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.279" end="00:16:39.519" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.000" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">but conflict simply means we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.519" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">through a problem together and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">if we go and solve a problem together in</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">a sense that&#39;s also kind of a flavor of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:47.199" style="s2">mutual appreciation right these all kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">of build on each other</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.199" end="00:16:51.360" style="s2">but trustall conflict is such a hugely</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">important part</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.360" end="00:16:56.079" style="s2">of building uh shared values uh and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">emerging a relationship because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.079" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">both</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:16:59.199" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of instead of two people</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">looking inwards at each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.199" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">facing outwards right they&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">outwards towards a shared problem they</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">have a shared mission</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:07.280" style="s2">shared values and lastly exploring</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.280" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">and this is very important too because</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.640" style="s2">when we explore truly explore</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re in a liminal we&#39;re operating</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.640" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">in a liminal zone we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">we&#39;re not there to confirm a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:19.679" style="s2">we have to prove ourselves right to all</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">the people around us</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.679" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">we are exploring because we literally</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:22.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know let&#39;s just go and talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.880" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s in a sense it&#39;s also so the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:27.679" style="s2">left you can think of as um</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">somewhat inward facing towards each</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.679" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">other in the dyad and the last two</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">are sort of outward facing you&#39;re either</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">facing something that threatens you so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:35.520" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re resolving a conflict maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an internal conflict maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.520" end="00:17:38.559" style="s2">external conflict</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.640" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">exploring is definitely outwards facing</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.559" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re looking at some new</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:43.039" style="s2">space together</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">so these are ways that we build values</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.039" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">that&#39;s how that&#39;s how essentially</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">if you think about this back to the wave</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">and field analogy</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">when two things if you have if you throw</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:54.160" style="s2">a rock</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">if you or maybe the best thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.160" end="00:17:57.840" style="s2">is like if you have um</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">if you have the surface of a pond and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.840" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">you throw a rock into here and you throw</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">a rock over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:03.440" style="s2">those waves will just randomly like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">know pass through each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.440" end="00:18:06.799" style="s2">but if you throw rocks of roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:09.280" style="s2">similar size</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.799" end="00:18:10.880" style="s2">in at the same speed those waves will</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.280" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">form a resonance pattern</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.880" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">and they will form fixed points of of um</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">of uh constructive and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">interference</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">and those wave patterns will be in</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">resonance so this is really about</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:27.360" style="s2">creating resonant values in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">field in that relationship field</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.360" end="00:18:30.799" style="s2">now that&#39;s just diaz again we think</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.640" end="00:18:33.760" style="s2">about relationship as me to you</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.799" end="00:18:34.960" style="s2">um but if you think about just four if</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.760" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">you have just four people</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.960" end="00:18:38.960" style="s2">or four agents or four nodes how many</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">relationships are there</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.960" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">if you think only in terms of dyadic</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got seven pairwise</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">relationships binary or diatonic</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:49.360" style="s2">but if you think about a relationship as</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">being one person</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.360" end="00:18:54.960" style="s2">towards a dyad then there&#39;s 12 of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">actually and if you look at as one</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">person to uh a three-way group there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">four of those i mean i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">read this chart but</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.919" end="00:19:03.200" style="s2">but the when you get to the 2 2 and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.679" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">4-0 is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.200" end="00:19:06.960" style="s2">the idea that relationships themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">have relationships</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.960" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">and this is all very abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">mathematical but to make this extremely</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">concrete for people</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.640" end="00:19:14.720" style="s2">think about a family with a mother</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">father and a son and a daughter this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.720" end="00:19:18.160" style="s2">my family right so so me and my wife and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">my son and daughter</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.160" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">we can identify all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">relationships within that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:25.600" style="s2">the relationship we need to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">this intuitively what is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.600" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">any of us can look at a family and say</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:30.720" style="s2">what&#39;s the relationship here between the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:33.760" style="s2">parents and the kids</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.720" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s now a pair to a pair that is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.760" end="00:19:37.760" style="s2">two-two relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:38.559" style="s2">right what is so so you say well this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.760" end="00:19:40.160" style="s2">family wow</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.559" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s got real issues because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:44.799" style="s2">father is like uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">alcoholic he&#39;s an addict of some sort um</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.799" end="00:19:48.240" style="s2">and so the the this has a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">broken father figure in this</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.240" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a one well you can see that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">one two right that father is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">father figure to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">to the kids but the father is also a bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">husband to the wife that&#39;s a one one</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:02.480" style="s2">right and that father is also a bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">father in the family that&#39;s a one</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">three so even in a simple</p>

<p begin="00:20:09.760" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">uh sitcom level family unit</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">you&#39;ve got you just add these up how</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:17.960" style="s2">many different relationships let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">here that&#39;s 10 22</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">26 27 relationships</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">among four people and this is what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">get to when you stop thinking in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">of just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">nodes because if you think just in terms</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">of nodes you would say well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">seven binary there&#39;s seven relationships</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">because you count the lines there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">seven</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">uh seven of them right or i guess in</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:36.799" style="s2">here there&#39;s six before they get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">seven</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.799" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">one two three four five six</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">maybe miscounted it&#39;s quite embarrassing</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to go on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:47.679" style="s2">one or three i kind of swore i counted</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.679" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">maybe i&#39;m missing one somewhere maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s only six whatever the point is</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:53.600" style="s2">there&#39;s very few</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:55.600" style="s2">but when you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.600" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">assemblages when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.600" end="00:20:58.320" style="s2">relationships themselves</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:21:01.039" style="s2">as being things you can have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.320" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">relationship with it becomes much much</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.039" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">larger</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">and with this last one may seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">nullity right to say well</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">if we talk about a four-way uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">a uh it&#39;s not a tertiary quaternary</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">thing what do they relate to there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:18.080" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing for them related to well</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">they might relate to other external</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.080" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">things it&#39;s like our family</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.320" style="s2">and if you read any jane austen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">like how does our family sit in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.320" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">social context you know relative to</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:26.880" style="s2">netherfield and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">right there&#39;s a very good sense that</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.880" end="00:21:29.200" style="s2">yeah that multi-way relationship that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.200" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a unit that four-way</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:36.320" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">um that has a reality to it and when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.320" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a in law</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">you can sue i think there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">you can basically file a civil lawsuit</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.919" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">if someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">um it&#39;s a concept of loss of consortium</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">so if you have a couple and then a third</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">party interferes</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">like you know by seducing one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">couple</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">then the other can sue that person for</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">loss of consortium</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">as in having destroyed the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">right and we even in popular culture in</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">the vernacular</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">we talk about you know some like woman</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:17.679" style="s2">that goes to only date married men</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">as a home wrecker right not a husband</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.679" end="00:22:21.840" style="s2">predator but as a home wrecker</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">so even in these kinds of terms we</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.840" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">recognize that the multi-way</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">relationship that concept of home</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:29.120" style="s2">is just sort of you know any any number</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:30.559" style="s2">of people living within that family unit</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.120" end="00:22:33.039" style="s2">that family relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.559" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">so again this is a very long exposition</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.039" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">on a single slide where i might have</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">made a math mistake</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:39.679" style="s2">but the point is that this is this is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">very fundamentally different way to look</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.679" end="00:22:43.520" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">world stop viewing people as atoms</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.520" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">start viewing them as just a collection</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">of relationship endpoints</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">and ask about the relationships they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">in and also don&#39;t view relationships as</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">just being this pipe even though i</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">showed a tube earlier</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:57.440" style="s2">they are actually fields they are kind</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">of collections of waves resonating with</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.440" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">each other they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:01.360" style="s2">they&#39;re networks and webs and they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">a reality to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.360" end="00:23:04.159" style="s2">well in the open source world right</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:05.440" style="s2">something very close to my to my work</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.159" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">and near and dear to my heart</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.440" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">when we talk about a project forking</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:11.760" style="s2">what&#39;s changing there is not someone</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">made a copy of the source code and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.760" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">changed five lines</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually that the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:17.679" style="s2">the developers in the developer</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.679" end="00:23:22.400" style="s2">is sundering and the people in it are</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">saying we&#39;re okay with sundering with</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.400" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">we&#39;re splitting like mitosis we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">to split now</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.919" style="s2">and there&#39;s something there&#39;s a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">of loss well what is that feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.919" end="00:23:31.760" style="s2">loss what has been lost it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">same people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.760" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">you got twice as much code what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:38.799" style="s2">lost what&#39;s been lost</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">is that the relationship of n</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.799" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">that that sort of you know whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">want to call this order</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:46.799" style="s2">n size relationship web and complex has</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:49.520" style="s2">now been reduced to two times</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.799" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">n over two complexes which are not the</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.520" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">same right this is metcalfe&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:55.200" style="s2">in a nutshell uh metcalf is the um guy</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">who invented ethernet</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.200" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">which is kind of how whenever you plug</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">in a jack you know into the wall for</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">your computer</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">uh the protocol speaks nowadays it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:03.679" style="s2">ethernet he invented that and he had a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">law a network</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.679" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">a law about networks it&#39;s from netcap&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">law which is that the value of a network</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.840" style="s2">grows as n squared right where n is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">number of nodes in the network</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.840" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">um this is why facebook has astronomical</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">valuations why all the social media</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">the investors encouraging them to build</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">viral loops into their thing to get more</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:21.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:23.120" style="s2">because the value goes n squared this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.679" end="00:24:24.240" style="s2">also why extractive capitalism loves</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:26.799" style="s2">this dynamic because</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.240" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">extractive capitalism looks for uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.799" end="00:24:30.720" style="s2">exponentials</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">and a quadratic uh well i mean sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.720" end="00:24:34.320" style="s2">n squared um a quadratic approximates an</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">exponential</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">in small parts if you kind of look</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">pretty close to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">depending on the the coefficient so in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">any case this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">is something that i encourage this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">the mental model that i use all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:47.679" style="s2">where people talk about this that their</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.360" style="s2">their relationship was broken whatever</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.679" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">i stopped looking at them as people i</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.360" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">look at what was</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:53.919" style="s2">tell me about the relationship what was</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">important about the relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.919" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">what is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">what power did it have unto itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:01.679" style="s2">beyond what just</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:04.799" style="s2">these individuals can do every firm</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.679" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">every institution everything that we</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.400" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">all of those things are just swimming in</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.200" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s all relationships your relationship</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.799" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">it&#39;s all actually much better understood</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:26.240" style="s2">not as individuals not as people but as</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.240" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">and how those individuals might be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">to impact those relationships but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">relationships are sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">the big bag of the bagpipe that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">all the air in it you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">individual might blow into a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">but that bag of air that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">so this is one of my mental models</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.880" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">now related to this i&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.640" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">small pause to have some coffee because</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">i&#39;m talking slower slower now</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.720" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">related to this concept is dunbar&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.200" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">and dunbar um is this is a actually a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.640" style="s2">fairly recent concept uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">as far as you know academic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.640" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">models and whatnot it only emerged in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">um and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">everyone who mentions dumbar it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">those things or everyone who mentions it</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">mentions it with a critical eye like</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">well if you believe it or we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.760" style="s2">an approximation or it&#39;s a convenient</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.760" style="s2">uh it&#39;s one of those things that went</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.760" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">what do they talk about uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.760" end="00:26:26.799" style="s2">gosh johnny nelson talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">hilariously it&#39;s like one of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.799" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">things that went from academia</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">to the talk circuit to the cocktails</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">cocktail circuit right</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">so it&#39;s a thing that people you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:39.840" style="s2">talk about now without um</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:41.279" style="s2">without really leaving diving deep to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.840" end="00:26:41.679" style="s2">like well what&#39;s the basis of it is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.279" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.679" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">but the idea is very simple it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.679" style="s2">that based on the neocortex size of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">humans and based on what we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.679" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">in anthropological studies um</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">it looks like the natural size for</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:59.760" style="s2">uh human kind of primeval sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">uh natural cohesion social cohesion is</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.760" end="00:27:03.600" style="s2">around 150 somewhere between 100 to 250</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:06.720" style="s2">but about 150.</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.600" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s really the idea is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.720" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">keep social contact and send social</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">with about that many people beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:16.080" style="s2">you kind of lose track</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.039" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">right and we have this kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.080" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">this kind of limit is not new so like in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">uh plato</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">right right like sort of said maybe 3000</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">people was as big as you would get</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">for some kind of an integrated republic</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">beyond which then you sort of just see</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">all of it as the other you don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">as us</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">the limit of us is somewhere depending</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">on what you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:38.399" style="s2">between 150 to 3 000 i guess right and</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">if you are entrepreneurs or you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.399" end="00:27:42.559" style="s2">startups or businesses</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">you know there are distinct phases or</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.559" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">distinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:47.919" style="s2">um limits beyond which the socialization</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">structure of the group the crew the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.919" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">click</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">has to change in order to scale the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">mission</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:55.440" style="s2">so you know between three to five people</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">you got a thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">you get to about 10 to 15 people then</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.200" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">you have to be a little more explicit</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:00.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">how you coordinate when you get to about</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">30 to 40 there&#39;s another little minor</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:06.159" style="s2">break point but 60 is a really like make</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:08.640" style="s2">or break thing when you get to 60</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.159" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">on the other side of 60 people 60 to 70</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">people depending again on the people and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing you need to then build</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">explicit meeting structures who knows</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">what you&#39;d actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">model the communications within as an</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">explicit first class</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">thing um and that&#39;s exactly a</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">manifestation of this principle</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">that you can no longer hold in your head</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:30.000" style="s2">how other people are relating to each</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">other what they know who told who what</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.000" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">how people feel about it it just gets</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">too much you have to create a mailing</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">list and say well i informed the mailing</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">list and so now i&#39;ve done the thing i</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:38.799" style="s2">need to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">and then how people relate to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.799" end="00:28:43.120" style="s2">manual list that channel that&#39;s on them</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">right you create institutions you create</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.120" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">processes</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.840" style="s2">so that people then are not relating to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">each other they&#39;re relating to a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.840" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">of interaction</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">and now that&#39;s what an institution is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.919" style="s2">now the nice thing the interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">about this is that dunbar&#39;s number is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.919" end="00:28:59.200" style="s2">about human socialization based on</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">neocortical sort of stuff and</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s actually not bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:20.240" style="s2">because a lily pad actually does have an</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">integration surface area over</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.240" end="00:30:24.080" style="s2">over the the surface of the pond i like</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">that so if your frogs on a lily pad</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.080" end="00:30:26.720" style="s2">you know all these waves are coming in</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">if there&#39;s a couple of pebbles dropping</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.720" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">in and maybe dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">and a neolithic era when the water was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">certain density</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">150 pebbles coming in was about how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">your lily pad could integrate</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.720" style="s2">instead the frog it still makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">with what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.720" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">in the social media era we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">at not just how many</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of different rocks</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:47.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s the rate at which the rocks are</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">breaking that surface of the water</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.440" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">before the frog decides to bail and just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">give up and bounce off that lily pad</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">because it&#39;s too chaotic and crazy so so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">to make this concrete he says okay look</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:31:00.799" style="s2">in classical and classical dumbar</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.880" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">um the idea is that the reason why you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">have a limit is because over time</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">your model of other people and their</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">relationships to each other</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">right because again remember</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">intersubjective belief</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:14.000" style="s2">is your belief about other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.000" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">right subjectivity is your belief inter</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">subjectivity is your belief about others</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:22.799" style="s2">so this ties directly to this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:24.559" style="s2">you relating to a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.799" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">what do i believe about how my mom feels</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.559" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">about my brother right</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:29.600" style="s2">what do i believe about how my sister</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">feels about her boyfriend right</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.600" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">your ability to track all these beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">it&#39;s an it&#39;s intersubjective limit but</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">the point is that in classic dunbar in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">classic you know neolithic whatever kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:43.039" style="s2">tribal sort of stuff your model accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.440" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">grows over time as you have more more</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.039" end="00:31:45.840" style="s2">direct interaction</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">someone who&#39;s more distant from you kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.840" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">of further out your model accuracy is</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.840" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">not very good</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">and and it it&#39;s you know he drew kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:53.679" style="s2">this logistic curve whatever maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">linear doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.679" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">the point is that the more time you</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">spend with somebody the better you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">and maybe the less time you spend at</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">some point it&#39;s not even worth</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">you&#39;re still stranger to them but if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">form clicks</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">if people actually cohere together like</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">if that family</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.440" style="s2">always does stuff together they&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">annoying family that always does</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.440" end="00:32:13.360" style="s2">everything together it has happy family</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">photos on instagram um you can model</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.360" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">them as a click or it&#39;s like the cool</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">kids or the goths or the whoever you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">the science nerds you could you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">have to you actually have much greater</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:22.320" style="s2">model accuracy if you model them as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">click</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.320" end="00:32:26.159" style="s2">because you have modeled that</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.159" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">as almost as a compression right to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">oh well they&#39;re science nerds of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:32.880" style="s2">they love bill nye of course they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">going to go and watch</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.880" end="00:32:36.880" style="s2">some like rocket launch nonsense or the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.880" style="s2">lunar eclipse or something right</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.880" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">you can model them very accurately</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.880" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">without having to model individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">because you&#39;ve modeled their</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:44.399" style="s2">relationship to each other as a click</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.559" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">and so so that he calls this model</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.399" end="00:32:48.080" style="s2">quality boosting and clicks</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">so if you have to model each of the ten</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.080" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">goths uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">individually that&#39;s hard but if you get</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:53.919" style="s2">to model all of them is just well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">the goths they&#39;re gonna go to this</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.919" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">concert they&#39;re gonna hang out over here</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">you can do it that way and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">manage many many more relationships okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">now take this to</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">the twitter scale global village</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:12.159" style="s2">and well i&#39;ll let you read the text here</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">geographical coincidence no longer</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.159" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">limits a set of potential relationships</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">and he quotes a lot of mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">in this in this blog post um where he</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:20.799" style="s2">talks about</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">yeah mcluhan saw this the global village</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.799" end="00:33:25.039" style="s2">there is no sense of distance</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">all here is here everyone is here and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.039" end="00:33:27.360" style="s2">leads to and and again mcluhan called</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.360" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">he said this would lead to maximal</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">disagreement right this is where</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">zuckerberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">um arrogance and his naivete becomes</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">beyond the point of uh like naivety</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">into explicit negligent harm is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">people knew we know if you go and give a</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">bunch of people over here a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">people over here</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">a lot of connection to each other</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">they&#39;re going to kill each other because</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:52.399" style="s2">they they really</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">they don&#39;t mix you can&#39;t mix everyone</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.399" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:33:59.919" style="s2">so the idea here in the twitter scale</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">global village is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.919" end="00:34:05.200" style="s2">we can look at the relationships and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:05.840" style="s2">quadratic bound on relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.200" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">actually back</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.840" end="00:34:10.159" style="s2">into a dunbar number that&#39;s much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">the mutual followers and the mutual</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.159" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:14.560" style="s2">could be on the scale of thousands it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">actually about our ability to model</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.560" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the limit anyway</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">really fun blog post he says it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">one of four or something um some great</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">work that he&#39;s done there so</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.960" style="s2">uh definitely recommend it okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:32.839" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of exposition</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.960" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">about that um</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.839" end="00:34:36.399" style="s2">so uh i will say just a few more points</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">sorry for the walls of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.399" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">wall of text that&#39;s coming but</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">we already intuit that relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">first class</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:46.639" style="s2">in the following way anytime you think</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">about an institution</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.639" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">anything anytime you think about an</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">organization you</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">actually are thinking about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">institution not as the building</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">like the church is more than just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">building with a steeple on it the church</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">is the relationship of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">acting in a particular way and you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:07.680" style="s2">when there&#39;s a vacancy</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">right relationships are so first class</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.680" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">that when we pop the biological human</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">and the fact that the external</p>

<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">um and in fact is a much more useful</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:55.520" style="s2">metaphysical frame than simply viewing</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">individuals as atoms that go and hey i</p>

<p begin="00:40:16.800" end="00:40:19.440" style="s2">understand the crushing</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.280" style="s2">kind of pressure of that through this</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.440" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">context of you&#39;re on the receiving end</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.280" end="00:40:24.800" style="s2">of expectations in the social</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">environment that defines what you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.800" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">okay um</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">uh yeah okay this is just a point about</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">looking at the relationship looking and</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:34.800" style="s2">this gets you into that thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">the memetic medium</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.800" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">as a first class thing and how that</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">medium can ossify</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">reinforce and this is when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">um you know how like we look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:45.599" style="s2">the memes that flow back and forth and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">the meme war</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.599" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">um and the tribes and whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:50.800" style="s2">humanon or whether it&#39;s like trump</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:53.440" style="s2">being like teflon trump somehow he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.800" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">able to like just skirt past everything</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.440" end="00:40:58.160" style="s2">um what what you&#39;ll notice in this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.240" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.160" end="00:41:02.640" style="s2">the the people who are masters at doing</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">at playing the memetic field</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.640" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">they recognize that the memetic field</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">has certain dynamics which is that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">takes time</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">for a meme for a framing for the picture</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:13.839" style="s2">of a person</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">to uh both ossify to kind of to just</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.839" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">to persist and then it takes time and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">then takes time for it to decay</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:20.640" style="s2">if you put just enough energy into it</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">you keep it persisting and so every time</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.640" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">trump goes and calls somebody oh sleepy</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">joe or like loser blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">he&#39;s basically trying to pop a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">bubble it&#39;s like a dolphin blowing an</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">air bubble like think of trump as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:31.119" style="s2">dolphin</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:33.200" style="s2">he&#39;s blowing a little air air bubble</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.119" end="00:41:34.800" style="s2">vortex in a little air bubble ring</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.200" end="00:41:36.720" style="s2">and he&#39;s putting just enough energy into</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.800" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">it to try to keep that ring going</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.720" end="00:41:40.640" style="s2">and and then the person trapped in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:42.160" style="s2">ring is like but i&#39;m not sleepy joe i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.640" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">very energetic here&#39;s to me riding a</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.160" end="00:41:43.680" style="s2">bike</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re dude you&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.680" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">playing the right game right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:48.880" style="s2">need to fight</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">the ring you need to fight the the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.880" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">susceptibility of the medium</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s creating the vortices uh the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">vorticity kind of persistent</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">so anyway all that being said</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">relationships one more thing to think</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.520" style="s2">about is so to that point about</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">persistence of the vorticity</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">um and the social pressures and all</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">these things uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">what is the metabolism of a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">what is the metabolism uh of it in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">sense of like how does it</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">how does it keep itself alive does are</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">there relationships</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:23.359" style="s2">that have um sort of an attractor</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">to them a tractor dynamic that sucks</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.359" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:28.800" style="s2">or demands energy from their</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">participants to keep the thing alive</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.800" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">and if it does and it&#39;s able to suck</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">energy in a way that&#39;s parasitic or even</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:36.480" style="s2">detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:38.000" style="s2">to not symbiotic but parasitic or</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.480" end="00:42:39.920" style="s2">detrimental to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.000" end="00:42:41.920" style="s2">the the humans the individual&#39;s ability</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.920" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">to go into other relationships</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">we call that a cult right that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">by definition what a cult is that&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.800" style="s2">definition what a</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">um you know you see these manipulators</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.800" end="00:42:52.800" style="s2">we talk about master manipulators and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">con men</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.800" end="00:42:56.240" style="s2">that go and completely hack the</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:57.760" style="s2">psychology of a victim</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.240" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">and what they do when they hack the</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.760" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">psychology is they&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">a relationship that uh by itself the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">victim</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:06.319" style="s2">the way they relate through that</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">relationship they kind of get sucked</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.319" end="00:43:08.800" style="s2">into it more more</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a you can call it a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.800" end="00:43:10.800" style="s2">vorticity or you call it you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:13.839" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.800" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">an attractor but the point is that um</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.839" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">at that point you know that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">here&#39;s an agent so it&#39;s an atomic self</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">a particular structured relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:25.200" style="s2">uh to capture and parasitize another</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.160" end="00:43:27.040" style="s2">agent</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.200" end="00:43:28.240" style="s2">but if that relationship starts taking</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.040" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">on a life of its own and starts</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.240" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">parasitizing both of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:33.280" style="s2">to where the manipulator becomes</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.280" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">and that does happen right cults take a</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">life of their own</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:39.680" style="s2">movements and dynamics take on a life of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">their own when we say this thing is</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.680" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">taking on a life of its own</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:45.280" style="s2">we are again intuitively and in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">vernacular where we have a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.280" end="00:43:48.800" style="s2">talking about this thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">so when those relationships have a</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.800" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">metabolism</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">well you know what i always do is</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">whenever i see something with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:55.599" style="s2">tablets i ask does it have agency</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an agenda what is it</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.599" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">actually trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:01.359" style="s2">and most of the time relationships in</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:04.319" style="s2">these senses they</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.359" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">they um when they emerge in sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.319" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">human interactions</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s fine that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">whatever people hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">when the when they have an agenda or a</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">mission though</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">they do have agency right that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">call an institution or in our</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.079" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:20.800" style="s2">they make it actually the the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">explicit we are here our organizational</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.800" end="00:44:25.040" style="s2">mission is to do xyz</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t want to sign up for</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.040" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">that and you don&#39;t want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">that inter-relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:30.800" style="s2">then don&#39;t be part of that group but if</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">you are then you should sign up for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.800" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">mission right</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">and this is so anyway this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">same sense talking about something very</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">banal and that everyone has experience</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:41.680" style="s2">but hopefully putting a different lens</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">on it to how to deconstruct these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.680" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">um anyway and then another question is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:49.760" style="s2">do relationships have rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">um and i already kind of you know hinted</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.760" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">that we do at least in the legal</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">we do have concepts certainly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re a llc or a c corp</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">or whatever you absolutely have rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">right there are corporate rights and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:01.359" style="s2">can sue other corporations or</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">individuals for breach of this and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.359" end="00:45:03.440" style="s2">the other</p>

<p begin="00:47:14.079" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just like a question that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">edge of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:21.359" style="s2">um because mcluhan&#39;s he started using a</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">global theater instead of global village</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.359" end="00:47:25.040" style="s2">later in his career which is related to</p>

<p begin="00:47:25.040" end="00:47:28.160" style="s2">uh this concept of parasocial</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">interactions where someone has a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.160" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">relationship with</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">um but if you can go like meta a little</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">bit you see that it&#39;s just not one</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">narrative not one intersubjective</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:54.800" style="s2">narrative being uh projected on you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.839" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">like if you&#39;ve got all these different</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.800" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">reality tunnels mimetic tribes looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">at you in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">um but if you don&#39;t have that capacity</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:01.520" style="s2">to go meta you might miss that that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:04.160" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.520" end="00:48:05.280" style="s2">plot line uh but i wrote right here is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.160" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">like um</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.280" end="00:48:08.960" style="s2">type cast at avatar like you know how</p>

<p begin="00:48:08.960" end="00:48:12.400" style="s2">avatar</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.760" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">is there a way you can be in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.400" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">spectacle in the global theater where</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:17.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t get typecasted</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">uh huh great question um</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">is there a way to be in the theater</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:32.559" style="s2">without there&#39;s some actors that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">really good like johnny depp</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.559" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if johnny that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">example but he used to be an example of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">this that he didn&#39;t get typecasted</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:41.520" style="s2">because he had such a diverse</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.559" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">uh um talent stack in his acting ability</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.520" end="00:48:44.400" style="s2">that he plays so much roles</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">but then other actors you know they just</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.400" end="00:48:48.400" style="s2">get typecasted in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">so is there a way to operate in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.400" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">spectacle in the global theater</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">that avoids this kind of avatar type</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">casting</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">ah good okay okay so here&#39;s what i say</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">to that um</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.160" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">is there a difference between being</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">well we use typecast here in a very um</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:12.559" style="s2">negative sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">right that it is a binding on my ability</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.559" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">to be my future self or to be whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">else i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">to define myself in some new way</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:22.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.839" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">if we view it from that lens to say how</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">do we avoid</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">being rather than saying typecast which</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">is the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about the harm right is there</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">a way to prevent myself from being</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">trapped</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:41.440" style="s2">in a past incarnation of myself</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.680" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">um because that&#39;s what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:47.359" style="s2">asking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">um then right am i interpreting the</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.359" end="00:49:50.079" style="s2">question correctly how do i prevent</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">myself from being trapped how do i</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.079" end="00:49:53.520" style="s2">retain the freedom to define my future</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:57.119" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.520" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">so in the case of actors and whatnot um</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.119" end="00:50:00.880" style="s2">they know it&#39;s at that point you almost</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">do have to model</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.880" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">the the the uh broadcast platform</p>

<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">i guess right because that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">money but the studio exec</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">is themselves acting as the pointy tip</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">of the spear</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:36.400" style="s2">of a lot of social expectation that</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.400" end="00:50:40.240" style="s2">just prods you like a cattle prod back</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.559" end="00:50:47.280" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay well how to break out</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.280" end="00:50:49.760" style="s2">in that case you have to model the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:52.319" style="s2">studio exact you have to model the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.760" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">entire juggernaut of things behind it</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.319" end="00:50:56.960" style="s2">as the oppressor as a thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">trying to deprive you of your creative</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.960" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.760" style="s2">and i&#39;ll give you a very good example of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.760" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">uh uh chappelle</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">chappelle has a special on netflix where</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">he talks about why he noped out</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">after he had a very successful show and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">why he left</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">and he does this uh he does act i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">remember which of the netflix specials</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.559" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:22.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s i forget now i&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.559" end="00:51:23.920" style="s2">look it up but maybe we put in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.240" end="00:51:27.359" style="s2">later if i can find it but</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">he talks about he understood that he was</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.359" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">coming under the pressure of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">and he in fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:34.400" style="s2">does it in the way that only dave</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">chappelle can which is he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.400" end="00:51:38.400" style="s2">as he relates a story from the</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">autobiography of a pimp</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.400" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">talking about how much mileage you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:42.480" style="s2">put on a hoe before she breaks and he</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:43.839" style="s2">felt he was the hoe</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.480" end="00:51:46.079" style="s2">and hollywood is putting him putting</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.839" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">mileage on him uh and he basically noped</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.079" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">out before</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">he ran out of mileage so it&#39;s i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">to turn it really dark and kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">gruesome but but that&#39;s that is him as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:57.760" style="s2">as an individual saying i am more than</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">just the boundaries hollywood wants to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.760" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">put on me</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:01.920" style="s2">or the studio execs or whatever i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:04.559" style="s2">gonna do this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.920" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">how you escape that freedom or sorry how</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.559" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">you escape those shackles in those cases</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">um some people do it by going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">broadway right you see this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.040" end="00:52:14.240" style="s2">uh what&#39;s your mother daniel uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">radcliffe right he&#39;s like i&#39;m tired of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.240" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">being harry potter</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not a child anymore i&#39;m not a wizard</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:19.520" style="s2">uh i&#39;m not even a muggle i&#39;m not harry</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">potter</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.520" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go do some broadway for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">while right</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">so he changes to a different medium</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">broadway does not have the amplification</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:31.520" style="s2">of hollywood right um chappelle was</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">doing stan</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.520" end="00:52:36.720" style="s2">all you see this in comics a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.559" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a ready-made formula</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.720" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">they&#39;re making themselves all the time</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.559" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">their job essentially is to transgress</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.000" style="s2">uncomfortably</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:45.520" style="s2">right that&#39;s the best comics they always</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.000" end="00:52:46.880" style="s2">they point to truths through</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.520" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">transgression</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.880" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">carlin does this chappelle does this um</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">comics then once they go from this</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">downstairs like</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:57.760" style="s2">back at the whatever comedy catch and</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:52:59.839" style="s2">they go on to netflix so they go on to</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.760" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">like some big hbo special or comedy</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.839" end="00:53:02.480" style="s2">central</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">boom they blow up and that&#39;s when social</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.480" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">pressure comes back in</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:07.680" style="s2">so so i think you know i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.319" end="00:53:08.480" style="s2">cute answer for that but how you avoid</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.680" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">the type casting</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.480" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">but i think it is important to realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">that those chains come</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:17.119" style="s2">from the application medium itself their</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">result of the medium dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.119" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know a point i made in one</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:22.480" style="s2">of my blog posts was that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">water and ice fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.480" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">things except</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the same molecule but at different</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">densities right</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.480" style="s2">and you can take a hammer and smack the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">side of like smack it into a pond</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:33.839" style="s2">nothing happens so some fish kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">scatter away if you have a big block of</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">ice you hit</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">one side with a hammer the other side</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">can hear the hammer right and our</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:40.480" style="s2">mimetic medium now our communications</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">medium are</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.480" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">various things they are now we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:45.520" style="s2">trapped in ice</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">uh you know it&#39;s much more ringing</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.520" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more ringing going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">um so yeah i don&#39;t know that quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">answer that question</p>

<p begin="00:54:21.920" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">can you guys see this</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">this is from my presentation i did the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:31.920" style="s2">the decentralized web</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:34.000" style="s2">camp uh last uh july in 2019</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.920" end="00:54:35.040" style="s2">and this directly ties to digital</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.000" end="00:54:36.480" style="s2">privacy</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.040" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">um i&#39;ve been asking about why do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.480" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">want digital privacy since 1993</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">it always comes down to hiding stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">like whatever the government screw the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">government they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t know me um and i articulate</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:52.000" style="s2">privacy gives us the space to define our</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.000" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">selves right free of institutional and</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">governmental and social</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.640" style="s2">pressures it gives us free reign to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">whoever we want to be it&#39;s not a hiding</p>

<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:06.000" style="s2">and back to this picture you can see</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.520" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">what&#39;s my picture here privacy gives</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">us the ability to have agency within</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.559" style="s2">this realm</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">and because we all live online now</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.559" end="00:55:17.839" style="s2">digital privacy is so important</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:19.440" style="s2">because i have the right to be myself i</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.839" end="00:55:20.720" style="s2">should have the right it&#39;s an extension</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">want to repurpose this for like a meta</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:19.119" style="s2">modern stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:20.400" style="s2">is being in in the right relationship</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:24.160" style="s2">relationship with reality in the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:24.880" style="s2">relationship with everything right all</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.160" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.880" end="00:57:28.400" style="s2">these these institutions these other</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">people other relationships</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.400" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">these narratives that exist and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:35.839" style="s2">kind of all the sub personalities</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">that exist within so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.839" end="00:57:40.559" style="s2">how you described it that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">frame switch of having relationality</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.559" end="00:57:45.280" style="s2">first um it&#39;s not only descriptively</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:48.400" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">but it seems to be more ethical</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.400" end="00:57:51.760" style="s2">to if we&#39;re going to go with the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:53.599" style="s2">relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.760" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">a model that jordan hall was running</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.599" end="00:57:57.599" style="s2">with so i was wondering if you can</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:57:59.040" style="s2">speak on that the ethical aspect of of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.599" end="00:58:01.920" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.040" end="00:58:03.440" style="s2">yeah um this touches on some other</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.920" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">mental models too which this is just the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.440" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">beauty of it it all kind of connects</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">so jordan is you know he&#39;s not wrong but</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">the question is like so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">really saying jordan you&#39;re right i love</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">jordan i like to be very clear</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:16.880" style="s2">i have no issue with jordan i love it um</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:18.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.880" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">but when we talk about you being in</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:23.839" style="s2">right relationship with reality</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:25.359" style="s2">that already does this thing um did i</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.839" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">talk about interpolation was it</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.359" end="00:58:28.559" style="s2">yes it was talking about interpolation</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s a term from some marxist</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.559" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">scholarship</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.520" end="00:58:33.200" style="s2">but interp uh you know maybe i should uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">for those who are not</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.200" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">familiar i should just go ahead and</p>

<p begin="00:58:43.000" end="00:58:46.960" style="s2">interpolation share</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">uh oh yarko&#39;s here cool</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">um yeah so interpolation</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">this idea that um now this is based</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:58:59.920" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.440" style="s2">pretty heavy marxist stuff going on in</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.920" end="00:59:04.060" style="s2">here but um</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.440" end="00:59:07.040" style="s2">ultimately the idea is that</p>

<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">is very similar to what i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">about right like um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">and what their what the marxist critique</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:29.440" style="s2">was was that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">apparatus of the state or the apparatus</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.440" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">of like the capitalist economic</p>

<p begin="01:00:08.599" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">interpolation is what happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">right here at the output port</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:18.880" style="s2">of that relationship interpolation is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:20.480" style="s2">the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.880" end="01:00:22.400" style="s2">maybe the sum integral of all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.480" end="01:00:22.960" style="s2">relationships of the institutions around</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.400" end="01:00:26.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.960" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">telling you what you must be so uh when</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.480" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">to your question about jordan and being</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:33.440" style="s2">in right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">that still unfortunately holds</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.440" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">uh it creates it&#39;s an other ring it</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">creates like a me i&#39;m a me</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:40.720" style="s2">and i need to be in right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">with an other</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.720" end="01:00:44.640" style="s2">as opposed to asking what is the me that</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">is needed to show up</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.640" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">in this relationship so sort of that</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">sense of like ideas have people</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">relationships have people and if we view</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:57.520" style="s2">as being um</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">the union venn diagram of all of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.520" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">and all of the the both the gives and</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">the takes of all these relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">then we can stop viewing ourselves as</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:08.640" style="s2">simply a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">ball being bounced around how do i be in</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.640" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">residence with this thing that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">jostling me</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:14.160" style="s2">all this big nasty reality out there</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.160" end="01:01:17.520" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of stepping into it i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.160" end="01:01:18.880" style="s2">know if this there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.520" end="01:01:20.960" style="s2">kegan level or whatever else but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.880" end="01:01:22.839" style="s2">like stepping a different frame of mind</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.960" end="01:01:25.359" style="s2">that says what are all these things</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.839" end="01:01:27.680" style="s2">trying what do they want me to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">and what is what is it that i want to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.680" end="01:01:30.400" style="s2">and you can actually have that question</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">about how to hold these different</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.400" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">circles</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">um together um to use the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:37.760" style="s2">the stage analogy right all these</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">different spotlights</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.760" end="01:01:41.599" style="s2">and they&#39;re not all the limelights are</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:42.960" style="s2">not converging where do you want to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">what is the you how do you splash</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.960" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">yourself out like a blob to cover all</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">those limelights</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i say when you say right</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">relationship again i don&#39;t disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">jordan but i would i would delve into it</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">that way to say let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">already interpolate ourselves as being</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">other from reality</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">but rather see ourselves as co-creating</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">these relationship fields</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">because when we&#39;re a blob we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">a blob spread out trying to cover all</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">these limelights</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:08.480" style="s2">being in tension and stress we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:10.079" style="s2">highly reflective blob</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.480" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">that then reflects light onto other</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.079" end="01:02:12.559" style="s2">people we are the limelights putting</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">pressure on them</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.559" end="01:02:15.599" style="s2">i&#39;m demanding my employees to show up in</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">a certain way i&#39;m demanding my kids and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.599" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">my wife just show up in certain ways</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:19.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:21.440" style="s2">we are so so that&#39;s the inter-reflection</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.920" end="01:02:22.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.440" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">we&#39;re all in the middle of this this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.880" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">thing anyway</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.240" style="s2">sorry that i don&#39;t know if that answered</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">the question but that that was my yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.240" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">want to talk to it</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">that was awesome um so we&#39;ll i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:37.839" style="s2">to pick a few people and then uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll close out soon um kyle you had</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.839" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">some comments on game b and trust uh if</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.319" style="s2">you can unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:45.440" style="s2">share it with the group sure thanks</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.319" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">peter this has been great</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.440" end="01:02:50.799" style="s2">um thank you i i</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">way back in probably 20 minutes into</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.799" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">your talk i</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">threw out a couple of ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">basically just</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.640" style="s2">the thinking is that game b then is</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:04.000" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.640" end="01:03:07.520" style="s2">the reinstitutional of trust</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.000" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">um because the game theory of game a</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.520" end="01:03:11.280" style="s2">is the deterioration of trust and why</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:15.760" style="s2">it&#39;s self-terminating</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.280" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">right and so how how do you</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.760" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">is is there anything you can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">restructuring institutions to create</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">that environment</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:29.760" style="s2">of trust to change the game theory right</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:31.119" style="s2">and i know that that&#39;s part of the part</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.760" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">of the story that you might be doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.119" end="01:03:33.920" style="s2">next week but</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:35.760" style="s2">can you can you give a little riff on</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.920" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">that yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.760" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">let&#39;s see here</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.640" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">okay so what i would say is that uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">let me see here if i can just find this</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">one part here on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:50.319" style="s2">core of game b</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.960" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">sorry this is just just one second here</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.839" end="01:03:59.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:03.119" style="s2">ah</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:11.039" style="s2">i think my um my my reasoning is this</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:16.079" style="s2">trust is um let&#39;s see where&#39;s my slide</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:18.559" style="s2">here go back to here</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.079" end="01:04:20.240" style="s2">why i said trust is the fundamental is</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.559" end="01:04:23.119" style="s2">it this slide something like this</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.240" end="01:04:24.400" style="s2">yeah i mean basically you know if if</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.119" end="01:04:25.280" style="s2">game a&#39;s trust environment is</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.400" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">deteriorating</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.280" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">pretty quickly as we&#39;re seeing with all</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">the social and tech political and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:33.839" style="s2">technological forces</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">that are pushing on it how how do</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.839" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">does it have to break further in order</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:39.200" style="s2">to re-establish</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:40.559" style="s2">trust and how do you reshape the</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.200" end="01:04:43.200" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.559" end="01:04:44.559" style="s2">yeah okay back to that it&#39;s got it yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.200" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">okay so here&#39;s how i say</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.559" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">um i finally some stuff connected in my</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">head it just took a second sorry</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:51.839" style="s2">not enough coffee i&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">have coffee and uh i hear your jerky but</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.839" end="01:04:55.359" style="s2">i hear you all good beef jerky yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">absorbs some of the coffee</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">and you know reduces the coffee</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">absorption rate in my bloodstream um</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:03.359" style="s2">so game a as we talk about it you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:04.799" style="s2">if you talk to jordan</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.359" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">uh or maybe daniel schmuckenberger what</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.799" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">not they&#39;ll talk about it as being</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">rivalrous dynamics uh and rivalry and</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">things like that um</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:13.119" style="s2">i might talk more about molok uh you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">know ginsburg and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.119" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">sarcodex style um and and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:18.640" style="s2">my bent on it</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:20.240" style="s2">which is that we have created</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.640" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.240" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">that um uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">i mean they don&#39;t even talk about trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:29.920" style="s2">right they atomize individuals</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:32.880" style="s2">the whole facility of like the post-war</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.920" end="01:05:35.119" style="s2">era now has been creating institutional</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.880" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">political economic systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.119" end="01:05:38.000" style="s2">memetic systems we ignore the medic</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">sometimes we talk about this but all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.000" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">these different infrastructures of</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">atomize the individual they devalue</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:47.200" style="s2">trust they almost throw trust aside i</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:48.480" style="s2">mean and the crypto you know the crypto</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.200" end="01:05:49.680" style="s2">antics are the worst they&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.480" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">totally trustless</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.680" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">proof of work blah blah blah right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:54.880" style="s2">like no we want actually maximal trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">we want to trust preserving</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.880" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">trust is the scarce thing we want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:00.160" style="s2">create infrastructures that promote</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.240" end="01:06:01.680" style="s2">inter-human value creation and trust</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.160" end="01:06:03.280" style="s2">building</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.680" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">and all of the structures when you view</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.280" end="01:06:05.520" style="s2">it and maybe maybe i should just yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:06.960" style="s2">maybe</p>

<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">be talking about this right</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:32.720" style="s2">the intersection of cultures and and to</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">be very clear</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.720" end="01:07:35.200" style="s2">i&#39;m a you know full-blown american</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">through and through nine levels of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.200" end="01:07:38.480" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:40.079" style="s2">but if you go and you read what it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.480" end="01:07:41.680" style="s2">that the fundamentalist will hobbyist</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.079" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">which are funded by the saudis of course</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.680" end="01:07:45.200" style="s2">but if you read what the al qaeda</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:47.119" style="s2">philosophic</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.200" end="01:07:49.039" style="s2">and sort of political complaints are</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.119" end="01:07:50.000" style="s2">against the encroachment of western</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.039" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">culture and values</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:55.280" style="s2">into their world the complaint there</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i mean again like just like if</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.280" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">you go and read the unabomber you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:00.160" style="s2">have to agree with what they did</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.839" end="01:08:01.520" style="s2">but it is interesting you know holding a</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.160" end="01:08:02.559" style="s2">conflicted mind and reading what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.520" end="01:08:03.760" style="s2">they&#39;re complaining about</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.559" end="01:08:05.599" style="s2">and maybe taking a little bit of face</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">value and what they&#39;re complaining about</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.599" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">the basically the entire rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:11.920" style="s2">world having lost the memetic war to</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:13.599" style="s2">america because hollywood</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.920" end="01:08:15.280" style="s2">right is one of our biggest exports it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.599" end="01:08:17.359" style="s2">still our biggest export uh to some</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.280" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">extent almost powerful memetic export</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.359" end="01:08:23.440" style="s2">so game b back to your question actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">game b is how do we move beyond these</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:26.560" style="s2">mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:28.159" style="s2">that erode trust atomize individuals get</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.560" end="01:08:31.359" style="s2">individuals interacting with each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.159" end="01:08:33.120" style="s2">within rigid frameworks within</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.120" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">tyranny of trustless interaction which</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.640" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">the the uh almighty petro dollar</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:43.359" style="s2">almighty all fungible petrodollar um or</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:43.759" style="s2">if it&#39;s institutions of hierarchy to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.359" end="01:08:45.759" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.759" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">control and you know you report to your</p>

<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">dimension all the way up the chain</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:51.679" style="s2">you know someone treats you as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">replaceable cog that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.679" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">you know whinging about something and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:55.520" style="s2">they&#39;ll go take care of the grease the</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">squeaky wheel right</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.520" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these structures of game</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">a are about um</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">you know dollars and fungible units of</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.560" style="s2">value quote-unquote value for everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.560" end="01:09:10.239" style="s2">and then hierarchical scaling and</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">command and control for all the rest for</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.239" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">the remainder</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:14.560" style="s2">right for the for the residue that falls</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:15.920" style="s2">out of that and in fact when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.560" end="01:09:16.400" style="s2">about financialization destroying the</p>

<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">right even when i was a kid i thought</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.040" end="01:09:30.239" style="s2">about it as like i was like you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">i read out millionaires and billionaires</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.239" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">it&#39;s so interesting because</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">the billions and billions of dollars</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:35.920" style="s2">they hoard and the hundreds of millions</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:37.839" style="s2">they spend on their art</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.920" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">you can count that in terms of burger</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.839" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">flipping hours of the person flipping</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">burgers at mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:44.159" style="s2">right because it&#39;s fungible to labor but</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not fungible because the mona lisa</p>

<p begin="01:09:45.920" end="01:09:49.199" style="s2">is not the same as somebody actually</p>

<p begin="01:09:49.199" end="01:09:52.480" style="s2">need to live</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:54.560" style="s2">but we live in a world that&#39;s required</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.560" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">impact on everything so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">the game b approach is to say can we</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.000" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">solve for sufficiency from the ground up</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.239" end="01:10:05.679" style="s2">sufficiency both in terms of sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:06.640" style="s2">energy and all of your physical needs</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.679" end="01:10:07.280" style="s2">you know all the way up the mazda</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.640" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.280" end="01:10:10.880" style="s2">but then getting to play where we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:11.679" style="s2">create the sustainable architectures and</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.880" end="01:10:13.280" style="s2">infrastructure</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.679" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">so people can build real relationships</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.280" end="01:10:16.640" style="s2">with each other it&#39;s it&#39;s about emerging</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">conviviality</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.640" end="01:10:21.040" style="s2">um bubbles and cells everywhere um</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:22.239" style="s2">within the cultures and the tribes and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.040" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">the belief systems and all these inner</p>

<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">anyway long-winded answer but hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.760" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">that paints a picture</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">let&#39;s uh um end on one more question</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:36.880" style="s2">um sg you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.120" end="01:10:40.080" style="s2">about multiple cells and some</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.880" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">personalities and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.080" end="01:10:44.159" style="s2">hey uh yeah thanks hey peter um lots of</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:46.080" style="s2">great content</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.159" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;ll have to listen to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.080" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">youtube video a couple times before i</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">fully digest it</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:57.040" style="s2">but one question that i&#39;ve been um</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">toying with recently is i found myself</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.040" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">realizing that identity is more so</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">something applied to me than something</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:04.320" style="s2">that i</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:05.520" style="s2">necessarily control and one particular</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.320" end="01:11:07.600" style="s2">thing that would be useful</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.520" end="01:11:09.120" style="s2">is the ability for myself to manage</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.600" end="01:11:11.600" style="s2">different identities</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.120" end="01:11:12.239" style="s2">for different uses and really treat</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.600" end="01:11:16.080" style="s2">identity</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.239" end="01:11:18.800" style="s2">as a tool uh rather than a part of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.080" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">of the self um i&#39;m i&#39;m wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.800" end="01:11:22.000" style="s2">have any recommendations</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">how to go about managing that without</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.000" end="01:11:25.199" style="s2">losing my head</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:27.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s not something that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:30.239" style="s2">necessarily evolved to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.840" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">um yes you&#39;re right it is really a</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.239" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">difficult thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.760" end="01:11:35.040" style="s2">to manage that and if you mean manage it</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.760" end="01:11:36.960" style="s2">from do you mean from like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.040" end="01:11:38.239" style="s2">psycho social like psycho-emotional</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.960" end="01:11:38.719" style="s2">perspective or do you mean it from like</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.239" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.719" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">technology perspective or all of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">above i think</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:45.920" style="s2">yeah all the above if you can talk about</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:47.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.920" end="01:11:49.360" style="s2">um i think you know you might find this</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.920" end="01:11:49.840" style="s2">interesting this is a you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.360" end="01:11:51.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">appendix slides i didn&#39;t get to but uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.360" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">kalia identity she called herself</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">identity woman so identitywoman.net</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:58.800" style="s2">um but she has um a really great</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">presentation</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.800" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">i have in the link here um you can look</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">at it you can google for it it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:06.880" style="s2">domains of identity</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">um and she talks about it in any context</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.880" end="01:12:11.199" style="s2">and um if you look at technology wise</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">this is much more about distributed and</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.199" end="01:12:14.080" style="s2">decentralized identity systems and all</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">this other stuff but</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.080" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">um but there&#39;s many different i think</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:20.080" style="s2">you mean it more from the social context</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.880" end="01:12:21.199" style="s2">right uh sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.080" end="01:12:24.159" style="s2">how do i show up in these different</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.199" end="01:12:26.320" style="s2">places um</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.159" end="01:12:27.840" style="s2">and i think one of or no do you not mean</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.320" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.840" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">yeah i think so i do think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:34.000" style="s2">quite similar like i do think it reduces</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">down to decentralized identity</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.000" end="01:12:38.640" style="s2">but uh maybe my framing is more on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:40.080" style="s2">social side</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.640" end="01:12:41.760" style="s2">yeah well the decentralization of</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.080" end="01:12:43.679" style="s2">identity to be clear my interest in it</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.760" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">is about removing power from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.679" end="01:12:48.800" style="s2">structures that lock things</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:51.360" style="s2">in not about keeping it always</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.800" end="01:12:52.480" style="s2">uh de-atomized right i think people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.360" end="01:12:54.000" style="s2">fine to have your identity stored in</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.480" end="01:12:56.400" style="s2">some places that place is not</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.000" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">uh like orwellian like you must be this</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.400" end="01:12:59.199" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:02.400" style="s2">um to your point about that freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.199" end="01:13:04.640" style="s2">how do we break free of or how do we</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.400" end="01:13:05.760" style="s2">fight for our agency against this back</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.640" end="01:13:06.800" style="s2">pressure right how do we provide back</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.760" end="01:13:10.159" style="s2">pressure to these things</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.800" end="01:13:11.280" style="s2">a little bit um i think actually to</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.159" end="01:13:13.040" style="s2">start with</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.280" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">seeing the world in this way and trying</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.040" end="01:13:19.040" style="s2">to put your uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:21.760" style="s2">build a model of the relationships um</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.040" end="01:13:23.440" style="s2">build a model of the relationships and</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.760" end="01:13:26.080" style="s2">and hold those in your head</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.440" end="01:13:28.159" style="s2">and use those to think about all the</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.080" end="01:13:31.040" style="s2">messages coming through them</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.159" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">so um and and to the point of like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.040" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">stoic practice when you do reflect on</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:36.800" style="s2">um you know in your daily practice think</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">about what are the things that upset me</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.800" end="01:13:39.199" style="s2">what are the things that got to me maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.000" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">not upset what are things that pleased</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.199" end="01:13:40.880" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">right because positive reinforcement</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.880" end="01:13:43.760" style="s2">dopamine is a really powerful way to</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:45.199" style="s2">manipulate people too</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.760" end="01:13:47.040" style="s2">but you think about what are the strong</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.199" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">signals that came into me today</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.040" end="01:13:50.960" style="s2">through what relationships they come in</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.960" end="01:13:55.280" style="s2">and stop thinking about it as being the</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">other person</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.280" end="01:14:00.159" style="s2">doing it unto me maybe they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:01.760" style="s2">build the relationship in a way so that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.159" end="01:14:04.080" style="s2">the relationship itself</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.760" end="01:14:05.600" style="s2">does this to me or holds me in this way</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.080" end="01:14:07.840" style="s2">and i can push back</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.600" end="01:14:09.440" style="s2">on my end of the relationship and change</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.840" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">it right it&#39;s like both of you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">pushing</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:13.199" style="s2">this board and there&#39;s a marble bouncing</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:15.760" style="s2">in the middle and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.199" end="01:14:16.320" style="s2">think about it in that context so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.760" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">see just</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.320" end="01:14:21.040" style="s2">your identity and then the pressures you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:23.120" style="s2">feel that&#39;s also kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.040" end="01:14:25.280" style="s2">interpolation of a sort because it</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.120" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">casts you as a receiver only you do have</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.280" end="01:14:28.880" style="s2">agency in this</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.480" end="01:14:30.080" style="s2">um but the way you can manifest that</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.880" end="01:14:31.920" style="s2">agency you have to first be very</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.080" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">perceptive you have to think deeply</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.920" end="01:14:36.640" style="s2">uh and perceive broadly what is your</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:38.400" style="s2">emotional state in response to</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.640" end="01:14:39.679" style="s2">how that relationship is changing you</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.400" end="01:14:41.360" style="s2">and also do</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.679" end="01:14:42.880" style="s2">do you think about the relationship as</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.360" end="01:14:44.719" style="s2">different than the other person the</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.880" end="01:14:46.719" style="s2">person or the things the persons</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.719" end="01:14:48.159" style="s2">on the other side of that relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.719" end="01:14:49.199" style="s2">um this ties also somewhat to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.159" end="01:14:51.600" style="s2">gervais theory</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.199" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">uh to uh venkat rouse future base theory</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.600" end="01:14:56.800" style="s2">of institutions and organizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:58.640" style="s2">um who can model these relationships</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.800" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">within institutions explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.640" end="01:15:01.679" style="s2">will end up being able to make it to the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:04.640" style="s2">leadership tier</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.679" end="01:15:05.360" style="s2">those who cannot will not and so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.640" end="01:15:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s my</p>

<p begin="01:16:07.679" end="01:16:11.360" style="s2">meditative practice where we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:13.360" style="s2">like get a sense of the contours of</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.360" end="01:16:13.840" style="s2">relationality and then real felt sense</p>
