<p begin="00:00:36.420" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">doesn&#39;t so - mr. Garvey the other one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.640" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">processed but what are then discoveries</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">are awesome that I didn&#39;t require when I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">started because I you know like you go</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:49.289" style="s2">to the east you realize that Norma dalla</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">G that we had in paganism is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.289" end="00:00:52.920" style="s2">all there were just Hinduism how&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">right there Hinduism is no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">even each it calls eternal return of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">same so yeah every new year the world is</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.129" end="00:01:02.789" style="s2">born in you but it&#39;s the same world all</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:05.670" style="s2">over again like if the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.789" end="00:01:08.700" style="s2">mimics itself year after year after year</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.670" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">and nothing new really ever happens all</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.700" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">novels nothing is new Under the Sun it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.140" style="s2">a perfect sample of no matter logical</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">fundamental statement that is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.140" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">fundamental religion of humanity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:22.470" style="s2">the religion we had for a hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">ninety five thousand years undoubtedly</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.470" end="00:01:26.070" style="s2">the only religion yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">so I would say no matter all of you was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.070" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">there was a politician is no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">in practice I was a numerologist and put</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">people on the move you need to you had</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">to tell them a story in the evening that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:37.320" style="s2">tomorrow morning we&#39;ve got to get up and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:40.890" style="s2">move again and if you&#39;re not moving</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.320" end="00:01:43.290" style="s2">you&#39;re dead and behind us it&#39;s the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.890" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">goddess and she will kill you ahead of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.290" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">us are the fathers and if we just go</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">where they&#39;ve gone before us which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">the origin of the gods right who falls</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">if you go where they gone before us we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">will survive so I required monism and</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:02:00.060" style="s2">are required processed fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:02.520" style="s2">from religion I believe in no mythology</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.060" end="00:02:04.680" style="s2">solvency process and no matter all it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.520" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">modest so I could have gone all the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.680" end="00:02:10.289" style="s2">become a Hindu know what happened though</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">was that I discovered that even in Hindu</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.289" end="00:02:13.230" style="s2">mysticism separate from Hinduism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:15.120" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.230" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2">religion zoroastrianism is orestes</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.120" end="00:02:20.549" style="s2">Reformation came the idea that we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.180" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">create a world that&#39;s better than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.549" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">world we live in and of course then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">a marshall mcluhan guy and I studied</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:29.970" style="s2">Hegel&#39;s so there has to be condition for</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:32.910" style="s2">us to be able to believe the world be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.970" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">better than it currently is that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.910" end="00:02:37.379" style="s2">that could only happen after the art of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">writing has been introduced and we all</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.379" end="00:02:40.410" style="s2">know that we out the art of writing we</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have permanent settlements that</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.410" end="00:02:44.099" style="s2">stay permanent we still had violence for</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">like thousands of years and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.099" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">Gerard in universe is your art and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">universe opens up when we settle down so</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:03:00.989" style="s2">we need actually okay okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:06.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a rotten universe happened when</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.989" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">when humanity happen okay okay okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.590" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">alter okay</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:13.230" style="s2">I know but scapegoating sure I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:14.700" style="s2">agree in scapegoating escalated when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.230" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">have the permanent settlements I get to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.700" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">chin for example is showing we denoted</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:19.139" style="s2">apology the first 1,000 years of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:21.989" style="s2">permanent settlements were the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.139" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">violent ever right that&#39;s very likely so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.989" end="00:03:26.099" style="s2">somebody had to tamed that force to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">begin with so roster doing it was we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.099" end="00:03:31.709" style="s2">Dasha and realizing there&#39;s one little</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:33.150" style="s2">loophole in Amidala gee you could use</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.709" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">this is very delicious</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.150" end="00:03:37.560" style="s2">so if de leurs would sit with us that he</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">probably agreed but the difference a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.560" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">repetition that he talks about the 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:44.430" style="s2">this little loophole the Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.919" style="s2">looking for where can the eternal return</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.430" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">of the same be broken so that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.919" end="00:03:52.260" style="s2">possibility of novelty exists that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">can build from which is essentially you</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.260" end="00:03:55.739" style="s2">become an engineer rather than a hunter</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:03:57.329" style="s2">or a warrior if you have a permanent</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.739" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">settlement now how did that shift happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.329" end="00:04:01.799" style="s2">well II know mythology I would say why</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:04.919" style="s2">the daughter mimics the mother</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.799" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">completely is what Lacan calls the woman</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.919" end="00:04:10.230" style="s2">as the one all with exception right</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">where no the one all the one all without</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.230" end="00:04:14.579" style="s2">exception where is the the phallus is</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:16.320" style="s2">too big did not know the woman is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.579" end="00:04:19.260" style="s2">non all that then declares it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.320" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">where&#39;s the what all that has an</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.260" end="00:04:24.360" style="s2">exception is the fairness right so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:25.979" style="s2">means coming out of a makan understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.360" end="00:04:27.150" style="s2">ER that means if you read the list</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.979" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">there&#39;s the possum</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.150" end="00:04:30.990" style="s2">for the Sun to be different from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.979" style="s2">father and that probably was the case in</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.990" end="00:04:33.660" style="s2">the nomadic tribe the sound was</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.979" end="00:04:35.160" style="s2">different from the father she come up</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.660" end="00:04:36.900" style="s2">with a novel solution to a current</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.160" end="00:04:39.419" style="s2">problem that solution would then be</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.900" end="00:04:40.889" style="s2">forgotten that&#39;s why you had to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.419" end="00:04:44.669" style="s2">the same mistakes over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.889" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">but by storing that information that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.669" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">means the father could die no my son</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:51.540" style="s2">will no more when he he&#39;s a man now than</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:54.120" style="s2">I did when I was his age that loathes</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.540" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">shift means that as the law says with</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.120" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">every return of the same there&#39;s a small</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">deviation and that deviation is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:01.410" style="s2">possibility of being a novelty on which</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:03.419" style="s2">we can build</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.410" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">if we can only store it you see how this</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.419" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">is even the beginning of artificial</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">intelligence today starts with that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:11.639" style="s2">evolution so raster saw that the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">completed that revolution then in 1967</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.639" end="00:05:14.250" style="s2">between it you get Nietzsche and all</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.960" end="00:05:16.139" style="s2">these other guys and process</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.250" end="00:05:17.850" style="s2">philosophers who thought of where did</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.850" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">how could you build that all because all</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:23.639" style="s2">of civilization all of technological</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2">evolution of the last five thousand</p>

<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:25.410" style="s2">mythology you can definitely be shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.060" end="00:12:27.870" style="s2">you can be androgynous go between</p>

<p begin="00:12:27.870" end="00:12:31.380" style="s2">circle and you can also be shamanic cast</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.850" end="00:12:33.420" style="s2">which means you go between between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.380" end="00:12:34.860" style="s2">tribes you could go to New Guinea having</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.420" end="00:12:36.810" style="s2">jarred diamonds new book writes about</p>

<p begin="00:13:05.699" end="00:13:10.079" style="s2">right so you have tribes are usually</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.129" end="00:13:11.819" style="s2">tribes they are held together and they</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">are you know the violence within the</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.819" end="00:13:17.550" style="s2">tribe is specified by turning the vans</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.590" end="00:22:25.230" style="s2">great and for somehow even though Tantra</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.410" end="00:22:28.920" style="s2">has to be it has to be done in secret</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.230" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">and it can&#39;t be a very public you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.920" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">affair at the same time it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:36.780" style="s2">very important</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:39.540" style="s2">maybe then in a less absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.780" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">acknowledged explicit kind of the outer</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.669" end="00:26:36.570" style="s2">forward because it ended up North Korean</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.470" end="00:26:39.029" style="s2">Stalinism that is collectivism in its</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.570" end="00:26:41.009" style="s2">purest form ever and individualism ended</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.029" end="00:26:43.169" style="s2">up with a religion called Scientology in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.009" end="00:26:45.749" style="s2">California in Hollywood of course the</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.509" end="00:26:58.710" style="s2">anything be more stupid enough but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.159" end="00:26:59.580" style="s2">is Cartesian individualism par</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.710" end="00:27:03.450" style="s2">excellence</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.580" end="00:27:05.190" style="s2">it is Scientology so you got Scientology</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.450" end="00:27:06.779" style="s2">one hat and you got North Korean stars</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.940" end="00:27:13.739" style="s2">maybe we can just please try to find</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.759" end="00:27:16.859" style="s2">something right in between the work from</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.739" end="00:27:18.809" style="s2">there which to me is tribalism but when</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.859" end="00:27:21.029" style="s2">in tribalism today we have inter</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.809" end="00:27:22.259" style="s2">tribalism inter tribal ISM if you want</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.029" end="00:27:24.450" style="s2">to say inter tribal in your own</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.259" end="00:27:26.009" style="s2">echo-chamber your loser if you go into</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.450" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">tribal and start exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.009" end="00:27:30.299" style="s2">challenges of actually trading with and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:35.749" style="s2">communicating with other tribes in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.299" end="00:27:38.999" style="s2">own you&#39;ll be a winner turn-key mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.749" end="00:27:41.460" style="s2">so that&#39;s networking a networked society</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.999" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">again sort of that is it from this</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.460" end="00:27:46.200" style="s2">conversation I would say Tantra and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">bard absolute the Tantra the bard</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.200" end="00:27:54.299" style="s2">absolutely absolutely tied together</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.220" end="00:27:56.460" style="s2">what did you say Thomas yeah some time</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.299" end="00:27:58.440" style="s2">ago we discussed the you know the this</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.460" end="00:28:00.119" style="s2">guru Mahal right which is actually you</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.440" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">know I mean it&#39;s often vilified but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.119" end="00:28:03.149" style="s2">mean there&#39;s something to say for it it</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:05.850" style="s2">oft often Tantra is kind of transferred</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.149" end="00:28:09.629" style="s2">by looking at how somebody is in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.850" end="00:28:11.249" style="s2">world right but but there is a talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.629" end="00:28:14.309" style="s2">about we mentioned Osho right off you</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.249" end="00:28:15.899" style="s2">see an example of a guru gone rogue so</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.309" end="00:28:17.999" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to go there but not</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.899" end="00:28:19.950" style="s2">really basically so you think and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.999" end="00:28:21.600" style="s2">the network is the Guru right you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.950" end="00:28:25.249" style="s2">learn from your network you learn from</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:27.869" style="s2">your from the what is it that I guess</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.249" end="00:28:29.820" style="s2">Alexander would call it the tribe right</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.869" end="00:28:31.619" style="s2">and let her make sure that the tribe is</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.820" end="00:28:34.259" style="s2">not homogeneous that includes different</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.619" end="00:28:37.320" style="s2">religions so you can for example as we</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.259" end="00:28:40.200" style="s2">did learn from from Buddhism so that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.320" end="00:28:41.429" style="s2">can actually have a decent connection</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.200" end="00:28:43.409" style="s2">with Christianity and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.429" end="00:28:45.269" style="s2">broadening your eyes and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.409" end="00:28:46.110" style="s2">you can start looking at your own</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.269" end="00:28:47.970" style="s2">culture again</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.110" end="00:28:49.730" style="s2">yeah well that just reminds you of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.970" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">know you if you if you practice a</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.730" end="00:28:57.210" style="s2">tradition you practice Tantra Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:59.280" style="s2">for example it&#39;s best not to just study</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.210" end="00:29:02.190" style="s2">the text of tantric Buddhism is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.280" end="00:29:04.260" style="s2">best to you know to study as many things</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.190" end="00:29:06.299" style="s2">as possible and you know in order to</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.260" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">become like a cosmopolitan person rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.299" end="00:29:14.100" style="s2">than you know an arrow you know could</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:16.590" style="s2">becoming narrow in your and as you say</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.100" end="00:29:18.419" style="s2">you know stuck in your in your I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.590" end="00:29:20.370" style="s2">know I&#39;ve just I&#39;ve talked to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.419" end="00:29:22.950" style="s2">Buddhists who sort of they just become</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.370" end="00:29:27.090" style="s2">kind of parroting different Buddhist you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.950" end="00:29:29.070" style="s2">know by such a great guy right</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.090" end="00:29:30.990" style="s2">yeah true warned against you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.070" end="00:29:33.030" style="s2">Buddhism is not about like wearing funny</p>

<p begin="00:29:33.030" end="00:29:41.460" style="s2">adopting the culture of the people love</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.169" end="00:29:46.049" style="s2">that rather they start wearing these</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.460" end="00:29:48.059" style="s2">weird clothes and I mean it&#39;s great I</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.049" end="00:29:50.370" style="s2">mean I spent years reading longchenpa</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.059" end="00:29:52.410" style="s2">right I still absolutely love it but you</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.370" end="00:29:54.990" style="s2">know you can read you can read white hat</p>

<p begin="00:29:56.220" end="00:30:00.780" style="s2">these in some of these metaphysics or</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.710" end="00:30:03.390" style="s2">some of these philosophies I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.780" end="00:30:06.059" style="s2">have fantastic philosophers that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.390" end="00:30:07.650" style="s2">that talk about exactly the same topics</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.059" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">and and they don&#39;t come with all this</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.650" end="00:30:13.169" style="s2">this cultural luggage that that you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:17.809" style="s2">to kind of go through right which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.169" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">very difficult for us to to absorb I</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.809" end="00:30:26.130" style="s2">think that is I think that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:28.500" style="s2">good practice doc I agree and I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.130" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">say the closest we have but the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.500" end="00:30:31.770" style="s2">fortunate is a lot more boring than</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">Tantra the clothes we have in the West</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.770" end="00:30:40.799" style="s2">that still attempts the same thing is</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.930" end="00:31:10.790" style="s2">psychoanalysis has the Chan trick about</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.970" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">it and that&#39;s exactly why psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.790" end="00:31:16.440" style="s2">cannot practice within the state order</p>

<p begin="00:31:24.540" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">and foremost so yeah I do question the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.110" end="00:31:32.790" style="s2">system which is exactly what Tundra does</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:34.620" style="s2">not to teach you the ultimately you must</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.620" end="00:31:42.270" style="s2">meaning that you you you you must see</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.250" end="00:31:43.470" style="s2">through the system you must stand is</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.270" end="00:31:45.810" style="s2">corruption to understand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.470" end="00:31:49.050" style="s2">manipulation to understand also in</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:06.180" style="s2">psychoanalysis teaches of that but on</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:07.860" style="s2">the couch it&#39;s kind of boring we talk to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.180" end="00:32:09.750" style="s2">at least you get to fuck and take drugs</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.860" end="00:32:11.310" style="s2">and tons of shit so I prefer to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.750" end="00:32:13.650" style="s2">trying to cover to be psychoanalytical</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.310" end="00:32:15.660" style="s2">but they share exactly this idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.650" end="00:32:17.130" style="s2">borrowed absolute you take you retract</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.660" end="00:32:19.170" style="s2">from the world you move outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.130" end="00:32:21.210" style="s2">world and then you see through the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.170" end="00:32:23.220" style="s2">and you become actually critical of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.210" end="00:32:25.380" style="s2">Society of living but what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.220" end="00:32:27.270" style="s2">be involved in that society or not or</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.380" end="00:32:29.040" style="s2">wedge your part or something probably us</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.270" end="00:32:30.510" style="s2">to do the times you live in and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.040" end="00:32:31.950" style="s2">probably has to do with your archetype</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.510" end="00:32:33.960" style="s2">personality type you don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.950" end="00:32:36.150" style="s2">have to go back into the square and get</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.960" end="00:32:38.280" style="s2">engaged and be an activist but you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.150" end="00:32:41.040" style="s2">certainly see that yeah a few things</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:42.510" style="s2">could certainly be done to fix things if</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.040" end="00:32:45.930" style="s2">I get a chance to do it I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.510" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t necessarily with them it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.930" end="00:32:50.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">do it I can make the choice to stay</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.760" end="00:32:57.480" style="s2">retracted or to do something else</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:33:00.390" style="s2">there&#39;s no moral obligation on me to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.480" end="00:33:02.520" style="s2">in there and prove the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.390" end="00:33:05.250" style="s2">you&#39;re perfectly okay to because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.520" end="00:33:07.380" style="s2">not a soldier I would say that you can</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.250" end="00:33:09.630" style="s2">stay within process and ignore event if</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.380" end="00:33:11.730" style="s2">you choose to do so I cannot argue</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.630" end="00:33:13.080" style="s2">against you if you decide to go no</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.730" end="00:33:15.480" style="s2">matter logical because</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.080" end="00:33:17.160" style="s2">the numerology presents are perfectly</p>

<p begin="00:33:23.430" end="00:33:28.320" style="s2">your son could you know pick up from you</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.320" end="00:33:31.530" style="s2">get a kick out of that then I&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.850" end="00:33:34.050" style="s2">welcoming it because that&#39;s what of</p>

<p begin="00:33:34.050" end="00:33:39.180" style="s2">improve on a work of the world and these</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.150" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">days probably even you have to because</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.180" end="00:33:44.610" style="s2">you need to build around and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:46.530" style="s2">certain existential threats that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.610" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">preached a koto pian ISM and constant</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.530" end="00:33:51.540" style="s2">positivism but it could tokenism which</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:54.300" style="s2">is the completion of the Agricultural</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.300" end="00:33:58.110" style="s2">the completion of the urban industrial</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:34:00.990" style="s2">revolution and then synthesis is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.110" end="00:34:03.180" style="s2">actually the turn of religion away from</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.990" end="00:34:07.590" style="s2">the religion of magick toward the</p>

<p begin="00:34:12.840" end="00:34:16.290" style="s2">collaborate with with the machines you</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.940" end="00:34:18.180" style="s2">do with the machine is good up which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.290" end="00:34:19.500" style="s2">probably logos and we should focus on</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.180" end="00:34:22.460" style="s2">what human beings are good at we just</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.500" end="00:34:24.810" style="s2">pathos to then find a share methyls</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.460" end="00:34:26.490" style="s2">that&#39;s how I see synthase and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.810" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">where it comes in and then of course you</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.490" end="00:34:29.760" style="s2">can go back to any of the religions and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:33.240" style="s2">discovered that the religion of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.760" end="00:34:35.850" style="s2">technology was there all along it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.240" end="00:34:37.350" style="s2">part of all all parts are looking to</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.850" end="00:34:38.970" style="s2">teach you how to be grown-up take</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.970" end="00:34:42.300" style="s2">and then if you can&#39;t improve on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.590" end="00:34:44.010" style="s2">world all of that is religion of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.300" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">technology it&#39;s not religion or magic</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.010" end="00:34:48.930" style="s2">later on magic was mercifully right</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.740" end="00:34:51.060" style="s2">John causes psycho technology and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.930" end="00:34:53.400" style="s2">there&#39;s technology agree I agree I agree</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.060" end="00:34:55.920" style="s2">psycho technology yeah so we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.400" end="00:34:57.450" style="s2">telepathetic you know miracles any</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.920" end="00:34:58.980" style="s2">longer we don&#39;t need to walk or water or</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.450" end="00:35:01.170" style="s2">anything like that or why because we</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.980" end="00:35:04.020" style="s2">have we have boats and then we have your</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.170" end="00:35:05.400" style="s2">waterskiing and we have smartphones we</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.020" end="00:35:07.670" style="s2">have technologists now that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.400" end="00:35:10.410" style="s2">invented simply because we had magic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.670" end="00:35:12.090" style="s2">magic made you know young guys think</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.410" end="00:35:14.490" style="s2">that I could actually make that happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.090" end="00:35:18.660" style="s2">for real and that&#39;s the engineering</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.490" end="00:35:21.360" style="s2">mindset that&#39;s wherever ontology starts</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.660" end="00:35:22.740" style="s2">this is what a mental logical religious</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.360" end="00:35:25.500" style="s2">that deal with the phallic to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.740" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">this is phallic of ontology to me</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.500" end="00:35:29.350" style="s2">now I&#39;m interested anybody out there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:31.630" style="s2">interested in exploring frolicking</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.350" end="00:35:33.430" style="s2">ontology this welcomed a converted</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.630" end="00:35:34.870" style="s2">Zoroastrianism because it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.430" end="00:35:36.910" style="s2">phallic in ontology it&#39;s a center of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.870" end="00:35:38.500" style="s2">that religion but it doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.910" end="00:35:39.790" style="s2">trace of phallic of ontology does exist</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.500" end="00:35:45.160" style="s2">all the cultures of course it does</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.790" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">especially today although civilization</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.160" end="00:35:53.560" style="s2">is about that we haven&#39;t improved at all</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:54.309" style="s2">technologies the entire improvement it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.560" end="00:35:55.689" style="s2">everything that</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.309" end="00:35:58.029" style="s2">make several different today for what it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.689" end="00:35:59.609" style="s2">was five years ago is a direct result of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.029" end="00:36:02.759" style="s2">technology try to make the link between</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.609" end="00:36:06.089" style="s2">technology and Tantra I&#39;m trying to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.759" end="00:36:09.160" style="s2">well technology can be taught in Sutra</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.089" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">but maybe not technological innovation I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.160" end="00:36:14.709" style="s2">don&#39;t know the technological mimicry can</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:18.309" style="s2">and that&#39;s a large part of practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.709" end="00:36:21.130" style="s2">technology you know 99.5% of practice</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.309" end="00:36:23.890" style="s2">technology is just mimicking but the one</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.130" end="00:36:27.509" style="s2">part that is the in innovation of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.890" end="00:36:30.759" style="s2">new technology probably would require</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.509" end="00:36:33.609" style="s2">tantric mindset or a more laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.759" end="00:36:36.910" style="s2">mode right and in the laboratory mode</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.609" end="00:36:38.769" style="s2">has to be what retraction exclusion</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.910" end="00:36:41.349" style="s2">moving out of society separating</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.769" end="00:36:46.479" style="s2">yourself to go into a truly innovative</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.349" end="00:36:48.420" style="s2">mode very interesting yeah there&#39;s a ton</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.479" end="00:36:50.439" style="s2">tantric mindset that gets you out of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.420" end="00:36:52.630" style="s2">copying right I mean it&#39;s what Peter</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.439" end="00:36:54.729" style="s2">Thiel calls you know going from zero to</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.630" end="00:36:58.449" style="s2">one instead of going from wanted and</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.319" end="00:37:29.619" style="s2">but it can be inherently very very</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.719" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">problematic right this this this mimesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.619" end="00:37:33.609" style="s2">and basically it&#39;s behavior that cannot</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.469" end="00:37:50.199" style="s2">right it makes you think and it says</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.499" end="00:37:54.489" style="s2">something new in in in a very surprising</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.199" end="00:37:56.920" style="s2">way and yeah I think that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.489" end="00:37:59.769" style="s2">in some way in some level it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.920" end="00:38:01.449" style="s2">it&#39;s just pure creation it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.579" end="00:38:09.720" style="s2">art to mean really that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.170" end="00:38:11.970" style="s2">metaphor sexuality and art are just</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.720" end="00:38:14.369" style="s2">talking art is not transformative unless</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.970" end="00:38:16.109" style="s2">it has a ton of quality otherwise it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.369" end="00:38:20.460" style="s2">just decoration that&#39;s what happens when</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.460" end="00:38:27.810" style="s2">requires novelty mm-hmm yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">why the conservative people who really</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.810" end="00:38:31.800" style="s2">don&#39;t like art very much because they</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:33.150" style="s2">want they want to keep which they go and</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.490" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">aesthetics that&#39;s why that&#39;s why always</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.329" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">dictatorships always look boringly ugly</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:55.650" style="s2">they look like yeah it&#39;s like a nobody</p>

<p begin="00:39:11.490" end="00:39:19.260" style="s2">dictators love precisely because they</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.319" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">hate Tantra they hate art so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.260" end="00:39:24.030" style="s2">they blow up with aesthetics that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:26.550" style="s2">just infant Isaac Hitler wanted to copy</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.750" style="s2">else and then he had these fantasies</p>

<p begin="00:39:39.510" end="00:39:43.619" style="s2">as me he totally felt he was failed</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.430" end="00:39:45.510" style="s2">precisely because he could not beat he</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.619" end="00:39:47.069" style="s2">didn&#39;t have the talent to be country he</p>

<p begin="00:39:59.940" end="00:40:04.140" style="s2">blend that&#39;s a spectacular example of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.460" end="00:40:06.780" style="s2">the use of the victim each mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.140" end="00:40:12.329" style="s2">right there is it&#39;s an extreme return to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.780" end="00:40:14.849" style="s2">paganism yeah absolutely yeah nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.329" end="00:40:15.990" style="s2">to scan paganism that that&#39;s exactly not</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.849" end="00:40:18.210" style="s2">system in Germany it&#39;s paid</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.990" end="00:40:20.310" style="s2">Gnosticism combined is exactly what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.210" end="00:40:23.040" style="s2">this may be a good way to put it because</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.310" end="00:40:25.440" style="s2">yeah Gnosticism and paganism that made</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.040" end="00:40:29.460" style="s2">some weird cocktail and it completely</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.440" end="00:40:31.320" style="s2">exploded yeah call me mean Iran is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.460" end="00:40:34.230" style="s2">good example too because he&#39;s the murder</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.320" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">of Islamic Gnosticism and even Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.230" end="00:40:37.470" style="s2">theologians don&#39;t even understand what</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:39.420" style="s2">Khamenei was all about</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.470" end="00:40:42.810" style="s2">he was even rare and weird to the Shia</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.420" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">Muslims he was incredibly charismatic he</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.810" end="00:40:46.320" style="s2">state didn&#39;t stay true to single word he</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">ever said in his life he only saw like</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.320" end="00:40:50.430" style="s2">the benefit of his own artistic mission</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:52.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s incredibly Gnostic he saw</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.430" end="00:40:55.890" style="s2">himself as a gnostic misti very similar</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.890" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">to Hitler I mean he was terrible very</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.890" end="00:40:59.790" style="s2">similar titler and popular too because</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:04.110" style="s2">something to do also with an inability</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.790" end="00:41:06.740" style="s2">that - to kind of have a see the humor</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.110" end="00:41:08.940" style="s2">of existence on some level it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.740" end="00:41:11.850" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a sense of humor dog</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:14.600" style="s2">again humor is pathos humor is that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.850" end="00:41:16.830" style="s2">know machines cannot crack jokes</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.600" end="00:41:19.260" style="s2">definitely something human beings do and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.830" end="00:41:22.080" style="s2">definitely something is tantric so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.260" end="00:41:24.330" style="s2">are at our best or humans we go towards</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.080" end="00:41:27.330" style="s2">the human not just cracking jokes but</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.330" end="00:41:31.020" style="s2">humor in the sense of like real humorous</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.330" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">like the humors or something or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.020" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">know what I&#39;m trying to say here and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:36.359" style="s2">think Simon Craig she wrote a book like</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:40.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something extremely humorous</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.359" end="00:41:42.750" style="s2">about about about you know well children</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.680" end="00:41:45.180" style="s2">Trevor called it this blue pancake that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.750" end="00:41:47.520" style="s2">falls from the sky it&#39;s like you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.180" end="00:41:49.230" style="s2">whole enterprise as its kind of humor to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.520" end="00:41:52.109" style="s2">it that if you don&#39;t see that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.230" end="00:41:53.640" style="s2">you&#39;re in trouble most dark humor is an</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.109" end="00:41:55.619" style="s2">example of intelligence that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.640" end="00:41:59.210" style="s2">deal with catastrophe in the most</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.619" end="00:42:01.980" style="s2">creative way possible so yes okay so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.210" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">again so I&#39;m a Christian a boring book</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.980" end="00:42:06.330" style="s2">on humor on purpose great book and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">he says says humor is fundamentally a</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.330" end="00:42:09.840" style="s2">form of intelligence it&#39;s it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:12.990" style="s2">stupidity not to be able to understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.840" end="00:42:15.630" style="s2">humor because you&#39;re lacking a level it</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.990" end="00:42:17.460" style="s2">is they again it is it is when logos and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.630" end="00:42:20.790" style="s2">pathos cannot collaborate and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.460" end="00:42:22.950" style="s2">already the pathology of Sutra is is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.790" end="00:42:25.050" style="s2">certain kind of humor lessness yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.950" end="00:42:26.940" style="s2">we&#39;re back talking about because that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.050" end="00:42:28.650" style="s2">was our original topics you know suture</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.940" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">versus Tantra so</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.650" end="00:42:32.310" style="s2">and not only do they lack human when</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.050" style="s2">they get stuck on the citric side and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.310" end="00:42:36.200" style="s2">can&#39;t be turned trick they also get</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.110" end="00:43:34.410" style="s2">chambers only seeing people who think</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.030" end="00:43:36.360" style="s2">like they do and using the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.410" end="00:43:38.250" style="s2">vocabulary off what the same and also</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.360" end="00:43:42.150" style="s2">we&#39;re back to Gerrard again and also</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.250" end="00:43:45.660" style="s2">they tend to be unconsciously searching</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.150" end="00:43:47.670" style="s2">for a scapegoat oh yes because there</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.660" end="00:43:49.590" style="s2">there&#39;s this emptiness inside of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.670" end="00:43:52.440" style="s2">that you know they just they have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.590" end="00:43:55.860" style="s2">find because they&#39;ve become so loved and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.440" end="00:43:58.020" style="s2">lady that they they&#39;re the they have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.860" end="00:44:00.570" style="s2">push down the dark side of them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.020" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">like they exert their first order of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.570" end="00:44:04.770" style="s2">classical scapegoating because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:08.330" style="s2">they first turn you into a messiah and a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.770" end="00:44:08.330" style="s2">guru and then they go after</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.080" end="00:44:17.010" style="s2">sadomasochism right yeah that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.760" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s sheer art wrote a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.010" end="00:44:23.160" style="s2">so it&#39;s I mean there&#39;s this metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:24.780" style="s2">desire and stuff like that I mean it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:27.900" style="s2">mean I loves you right because he</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.780" end="00:44:30.060" style="s2">explains all these very puzzling aspects</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.900" end="00:44:32.880" style="s2">of human behavior like say the masochism</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.060" end="00:44:35.940" style="s2">where does that come from I mean it all</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.880" end="00:44:37.590" style="s2">fits into his grand theory of the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.940" end="00:44:40.230" style="s2">mind which is basic that&#39;s the program</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.590" end="00:44:42.390" style="s2">that Freud started and that you work on</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.230" end="00:44:44.430" style="s2">and lock Albert on and Girard basic</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.390" end="00:44:46.470" style="s2">we basically finished it right I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.430" end="00:44:48.660" style="s2">is the is it&#39;s like it&#39;s like Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.470" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2">this is a Darwin or anthropology I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.660" end="00:44:54.990" style="s2">the dark which I&#39;m extremely surprised</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:57.300" style="s2">that everybody knows Freud and and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.990" end="00:45:01.500" style="s2">and Locke on and that that grr this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.300" end="00:45:03.510" style="s2">comparatively no it only see only</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.500" end="00:45:05.370" style="s2">started and peter thiel know this will</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.510" end="00:45:07.140" style="s2">breaks your art massively big I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.370" end="00:45:09.360" style="s2">sure art of the X started fifty years he</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.140" end="00:45:13.650" style="s2">will definitely be memorable definitely</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.360" end="00:45:18.240" style="s2">I mean he moved one of the joints like</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.650" end="00:45:20.370" style="s2">Whitehead or something yeah both in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.240" end="00:45:22.350" style="s2">anthropology where it&#39;s from le odd all</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.370" end="00:45:24.630" style="s2">the way up to Girardi what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.350" end="00:45:28.380" style="s2">massive anthropological revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.630" end="00:45:30.090" style="s2">the 20th century anthropology explode in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.380" end="00:45:33.870" style="s2">the 20th century almost on a par with</p>

<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:41.190" style="s2">of the ideas from the 20th century can</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.570" end="00:45:43.290" style="s2">also be proven because what apology</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.190" end="00:45:45.960" style="s2">after all is supposed to be science so</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.290" end="00:45:48.210" style="s2">in Girardi&#39;s is the king of that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.960" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">definite the king of that I read him the</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.210" end="00:45:51.930" style="s2">same way you do Thomas and I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:54.750" style="s2">amazing there will all be your audience</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.930" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">we are more or less already I can&#39;t help</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.990" end="00:48:50.990" style="s2">object but you become a process</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.910" end="00:48:53.630" style="s2">something fluid</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.990" end="00:48:55.630" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the tantric attitude</p>

<p begin="00:48:55.630" end="00:48:59.900" style="s2">perfection of that is doctrine because</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.010" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">in the idea of did in Tantra there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.900" end="00:49:03.650" style="s2">still the idea of transformation right</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:05.300" style="s2">so there&#39;s still the idea of like I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.950" end="00:50:33.150" style="s2">I love both of them don&#39;t worry only the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.410" end="00:50:34.970" style="s2">clever guys will find it so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.150" end="00:50:37.410" style="s2">bard absolutely and that&#39;s quite natural</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.970" end="00:50:40.290" style="s2">he said only the clever guys to find</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.410" end="00:50:44.190" style="s2">each the rest they lose their temper</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.290" end="00:50:47.849" style="s2">it&#39;s like wiping it is publicly released</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.190" end="00:50:50.339" style="s2">available to all but only few people can</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.849" end="00:50:51.780" style="s2">read him and that actually saves him on</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.339" end="00:50:54.119" style="s2">the right side of the bard absolutes</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.780" end="00:50:57.470" style="s2">know there&#39;s quite a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.119" end="00:51:01.560" style="s2">who follow this I&#39;d say about a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.470" end="00:51:03.540" style="s2">for a minimum for each podcast and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.560" end="00:51:06.060" style="s2">and then you know some of them get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.540" end="00:51:08.430" style="s2">more so yeah but these are I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.060" end="00:51:10.740" style="s2">amazing I mentioned before it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.430" end="00:51:13.080" style="s2">that now you can just go to Amazon and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.740" end="00:51:14.730" style="s2">just buy anything right thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.080" end="00:51:16.380" style="s2">years of wisdom and then and then start</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.730" end="00:51:18.599" style="s2">cross-linking this I&#39;m discussing this</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.380" end="00:51:20.609" style="s2">like we did tonight and and that gives</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.599" end="00:51:24.029" style="s2">that gives me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.609" end="00:51:26.039" style="s2">because all of new thinking is going on</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.029" end="00:51:27.539" style="s2">a lot of new solutions can emerge yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.039" end="00:51:28.829" style="s2">and we don&#39;t even have search engines</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.539" end="00:51:30.329" style="s2">tied to order yet but that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.829" end="00:51:32.489" style="s2">happen that&#39;s one of the things I will</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.329" end="00:51:34.559" style="s2">do for us and then you can just say when</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.489" end="00:51:35.309" style="s2">was this bird first used in history and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:37.049" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go and said there was a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.309" end="00:51:39.479" style="s2">certain podcast recorded this year at</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.049" end="00:51:41.969" style="s2">the state 46 minutes 11 seconds into it</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.479" end="00:51:44.309" style="s2">here&#39;s the work I mean you&#39;re amazing</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.309" end="00:51:47.819" style="s2">help us they basically say we got a huge</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.259" end="00:51:50.069" style="s2">huge library the expanse all the time</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.819" end="00:51:52.259" style="s2">and still although it expands we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.069" end="00:51:53.459" style="s2">just quickly within seconds find exactly</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.380" end="00:52:07.499" style="s2">the good thing I think it&#39;s time to put</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.349" end="00:52:09.420" style="s2">some optimism in the narrative because</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.499" end="00:52:11.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of gloom and doom around</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.420" end="00:52:13.949" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s yeah but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.339" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">humanity has always been on the brink of</p>
