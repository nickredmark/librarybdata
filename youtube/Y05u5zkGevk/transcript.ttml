<p begin="00:19:24.370" end="00:19:28.570" style="s2">here we have time for a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.300" end="00:19:37.910" style="s2">the first is some pleasure of doubt in</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:39.650" style="s2">meta when contemplating for example the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.910" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">rule you&#39;re assuming an assigning should</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.650" end="00:19:43.250" style="s2">this be done by internal dialogue are we</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">to have almost a conversation or ahead</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.250" end="00:19:49.190" style="s2">about it that&#39;s that&#39;s very very close</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">to getting it right this goes back to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.190" end="00:19:52.490" style="s2">you know principle that we keep coming</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:54.170" style="s2">back to and there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.490" end="00:19:56.540" style="s2">wrong with constantly coming back to it</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.170" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to use inner speech</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.540" end="00:20:00.860" style="s2">it&#39;s the raft to cross the river in your</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.820" end="00:20:03.559" style="s2">speeches or coach it&#39;s a way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.860" end="00:20:05.090" style="s2">coaching ourselves eventually if like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.559" end="00:20:07.250" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be an athlete you start</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.090" end="00:20:09.110" style="s2">with the coach eventually right you move</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.250" end="00:20:12.110" style="s2">to the point where you&#39;re doing behavior</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.110" end="00:20:13.790" style="s2">on your own and so you&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.110" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">yourself and then what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.790" end="00:20:17.540" style="s2">do is you&#39;re trying to do the minimal in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:20.450" style="s2">order to do the practice and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.540" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">trying to slowly erode how much you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.450" end="00:20:25.040" style="s2">to speak to yourself in order to do the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:26.450" style="s2">practice initially you will have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.040" end="00:20:28.670" style="s2">almost have like an internal dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.450" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">but as I mention like when you walk</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.670" end="00:20:32.210" style="s2">around a room and you&#39;re noticing things</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:33.290" style="s2">and you&#39;re moving your body in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.210" end="00:20:35.960" style="s2">skillful manner you don&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.290" end="00:20:37.790" style="s2">talking to yourself to do that and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.960" end="00:20:40.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to move towards that so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.790" end="00:20:42.500" style="s2">becomes second nature to you so start</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.520" end="00:20:44.570" style="s2">out with that but you you always have</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.500" end="00:20:46.970" style="s2">that you have this grateful but</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.570" end="00:20:50.780" style="s2">tentative relationship to the inner</p>

<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:21.470" style="s2">depths of it try to bring that silence</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:23.330" style="s2">but that silenced sensitivity back to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.470" end="00:21:25.250" style="s2">the rooting process or try to renew your</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.570" end="00:21:54.540" style="s2">thinking we do what is called</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.540" end="00:22:00.120" style="s2">starting to engage speech muscles this</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.410" end="00:22:04.200" style="s2">might be what&#39;s behind the throat chakra</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.120" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">idea so a lot of the chakras are</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.200" end="00:22:08.760" style="s2">probably I don&#39;t hold it there but a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:10.950" style="s2">physical interpretation but I think they</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.760" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">have a lot to do with having bodies we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.950" end="00:22:16.740" style="s2">are so we know that well you have very</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:19.980" style="s2">good at humiliating evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.740" end="00:22:23.940" style="s2">converging argumentation that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.980" end="00:22:25.800" style="s2">recognize things by actually generating</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.940" end="00:22:28.590" style="s2">them and that there&#39;s a deep connect so</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.800" end="00:22:30.300" style="s2">I recognize your movement by using the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.590" end="00:22:32.580" style="s2">same parts of my brain by which I move</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.300" end="00:22:36.720" style="s2">my own body to recognize your movement</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.580" end="00:22:39.450" style="s2">and vice versa and so and now another</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">aspect that perception and imagination</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.450" end="00:22:43.680" style="s2">are not two separate processes but just</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:47.070" style="s2">perception is more how information is</p>
