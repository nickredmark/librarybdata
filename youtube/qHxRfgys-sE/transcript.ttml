<p begin="00:00:05.509" end="00:00:09.650" style="s2">experience of what I see in my community</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.950" end="00:00:13.370" style="s2">this kind of captivating almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.650" end="00:00:14.540" style="s2">seductive sensational thing going on in</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.370" end="00:00:16.609" style="s2">the way it captures people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.540" end="00:00:20.600" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering like what can we learn</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.609" end="00:00:23.449" style="s2">about good distributed collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.600" end="00:00:26.420" style="s2">intelligence from q and on and then what</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.449" end="00:00:29.650" style="s2">should we be most cautious of when</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.420" end="00:00:34.210" style="s2">looking at that and learning from that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.650" end="00:00:34.210" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good question thank you</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.790" end="00:00:39.080" style="s2">by the way a bold question because as</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.290" end="00:00:40.370" style="s2">you know even I think using the letter Q</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.080" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">these days tended to get you thrown in</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.370" end="00:00:45.890" style="s2">jail so let&#39;s see let&#39;s think about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:47.150" style="s2">so first off let&#39;s recognize that I</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.890" end="00:00:49.640" style="s2">think the answer to the first part is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.150" end="00:00:51.170" style="s2">lot I think it&#39;s naive beyond</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.640" end="00:00:53.180" style="s2">comprehension to not recognize it that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.170" end="00:00:55.400" style="s2">was a very powerful valuable experience</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.180" end="00:00:56.270" style="s2">from which we could learn a lot so what</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.400" end="00:00:58.100" style="s2">are the some of the things that showed</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.270" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">up if you think about it and I was</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.100" end="00:01:00.950" style="s2">watching it very closely for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:05.990" style="s2">so some of the things that showed up I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.950" end="00:01:08.270" style="s2">would say are like cardinal virtues it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.990" end="00:01:09.800" style="s2">a deep stuff that frankly has been part</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.270" end="00:01:10.880" style="s2">of cold any culture that&#39;s worth of shit</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.800" end="00:01:13.009" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.880" end="00:01:18.250" style="s2">the phrase is like where we go one we go</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.009" end="00:01:21.080" style="s2">all notions like own your mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.250" end="00:01:23.060" style="s2">notions like take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.080" end="00:01:24.860" style="s2">actually digging take personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.060" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">responsibility for perceiving reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.860" end="00:01:28.580" style="s2">think bigger don&#39;t be trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.250" style="s2">existing ideological frameworks of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.580" end="00:01:33.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t what is not be aware the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.250" end="00:01:35.960" style="s2">this information is just information is</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.140" end="00:01:37.820" style="s2">everywhere so don&#39;t stick to any</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.960" end="00:01:40.780" style="s2">particular point of view and soon assume</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.820" end="00:01:40.780" style="s2">that that isn&#39;t Thoreau tative</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:45.440" style="s2">hope community connecting with each</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.460" end="00:01:47.750" style="s2">other helping each other and this like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.440" end="00:01:49.730" style="s2">you know in some sense it isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.750" end="00:01:52.310" style="s2">complicated just to take a look at at</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.730" end="00:01:55.790" style="s2">the mythopoetic archetypes of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.310" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">virtue and heroism and wholesomeness</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.790" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">have always looked like and do that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:03.979" style="s2">to the degree to which the Q community</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:05.690" style="s2">found that and upregulated that that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.979" end="00:02:07.160" style="s2">the strong positive virtues that are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.690" end="00:02:09.110" style="s2">fact in that community alright let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.160" end="00:02:10.070" style="s2">to the opposite direction it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.110" end="00:02:11.390" style="s2">because it seems to hold both</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.070" end="00:02:16.390" style="s2">simultaneously which is kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.390" end="00:02:19.420" style="s2">interesting thing where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.390" end="00:02:25.480" style="s2">certain mania there&#39;s a certain manic</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.420" end="00:02:28.360" style="s2">psychotic sensibility a you we live in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.480" end="00:02:30.310" style="s2">psychotic age and we live in a psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.360" end="00:02:33.650" style="s2">age because we all have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.310" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">interact with far more</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.650" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2">information about reality then a our</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:41.900" style="s2">minds can handle and far less</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:45.349" style="s2">information about reality than be</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.900" end="00:02:46.700" style="s2">actually tells us much about reality so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.349" end="00:02:49.370" style="s2">in an environment we can tell really</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.700" end="00:02:51.170" style="s2">awesome stories we can weave together</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.370" end="00:02:52.459" style="s2">narratives that sort of hold the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.170" end="00:02:54.230" style="s2">information that we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.459" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">gather and hold into something like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.230" end="00:02:57.950" style="s2">coherent story and then we try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:02:59.000" style="s2">fact-check that by actually doing more</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.950" end="00:03:00.109" style="s2">information this is what I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.000" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">the key phenomena has it&#39;s one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.109" end="00:03:04.970" style="s2">biggest gaps is it is so bound to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:06.859" style="s2">virtual and it&#39;s so capable I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.970" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">researching things at the virtual but</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.859" end="00:03:10.639" style="s2">then tries to draw conjectures on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:12.530" style="s2">basis inference and hypothesis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.639" end="00:03:13.819" style="s2">models of nature and and and models</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.530" end="00:03:16.730" style="s2">about what the underlying the axiomatic</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.819" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">structures of reality are and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.730" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">think that I don&#39;t know let&#39;s go with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:22.020" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">you think there&#39;s an organization called</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.020" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">Rizvi 2 verse which is tied to the Saudi</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">capacities and agendas then you can use</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.770" style="s2">that assumption complex about which you</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:36.660" style="s2">have no in reality to explain a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.770" end="00:03:38.040" style="s2">large number of phenomena now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.660" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">gonna get a whole bunch of anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.040" end="00:03:40.890" style="s2">phenomena around that but you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:42.180" style="s2">pretend to ignore the anomalous</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.890" end="00:03:43.410" style="s2">phenomena be really happy about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.180" end="00:03:45.870" style="s2">thing that&#39;s inside your explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.410" end="00:03:48.150" style="s2">framework which is you say the key</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.870" end="00:03:50.520" style="s2">phenomenon gives us bas relief on the</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.520" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">stop it tended to be psychotic and manic</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:59.590" style="s2">and to be self was the true bias towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:03.760" style="s2">its own self referentiality</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.590" end="00:04:05.950" style="s2">and of course we also seen a tendency a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.760" end="00:04:10.569" style="s2">strong tendency although not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.950" end="00:04:12.220" style="s2">a overwhelming tendency to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.569" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">exact opposite of responsibility to</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.459" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">us and I believe that is also</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.699" end="00:04:25.960" style="s2">unfortunate at the end of the day false</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:26.919" style="s2">which is to say only this to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.960" end="00:04:28.419" style="s2">which there are people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.919" end="00:04:29.949" style="s2">positions of power authority</p>

<p begin="00:04:34.300" end="00:04:38.590" style="s2">complete integrity then their interest</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.570" end="00:04:40.060" style="s2">in our interests would be completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.590" end="00:04:42.040" style="s2">aligned so we don&#39;t need to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.060" end="00:04:43.270" style="s2">whether they&#39;re there or not but to the</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.270" end="00:04:46.030" style="s2">from our own agency just sort of step</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.950" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">back and really hope they&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.030" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">good job and become cheerleaders or fans</p>
