<p begin="00:00:06.259" end="00:00:10.800" style="s2">so welcome to the fourth ruble wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:13.440" style="s2">podcast this is going to be about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.639" style="s2">intellectual dark web I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.440" end="00:00:16.320" style="s2">assuming most of the people watching</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.639" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">this most of our audience will know what</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.320" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">the intellectual dialog is but I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:20.910" style="s2">it&#39;s worth doing in a short introduction</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:22.519" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of emerged from the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.910" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">network of thinkers you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.519" end="00:00:29.010" style="s2">unofficially in it you&#39;ve got Eric</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:31.640" style="s2">Weinstein Brett Weinstein Joe Rogan and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.010" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">Dave Rubin Jordan Peterson sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.640" end="00:00:37.079" style="s2">Douglas Murray Majid Nawaz and a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">more names I mean there was there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.079" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">few that were in the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:46.829" style="s2">article that kind of officially I guess</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:48.870" style="s2">inaugurated as a concept I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.829" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">a slightly different take on what it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.870" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">and where it&#39;s going I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:53.670" style="s2">people are looking at at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">through a sort of political lens and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.670" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a good first step because I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">what it does is these are all people</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:03.989" style="s2">who&#39;ve got a real kind of attachment to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.630" style="s2">free speech an attachment to having</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">difficult conversations about topics</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.630" end="00:01:13.799" style="s2">that are increasingly difficult to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:15.509" style="s2">in the mainstream media and what I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.799" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">it&#39;s done initially like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.509" end="00:01:20.009" style="s2">phenomena of the intellectual Dartmouth</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:21.600" style="s2">has showed up showing up how ideological</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.009" end="00:01:23.000" style="s2">the media has become like some things</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:26.430" style="s2">you can say some things you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.000" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s a kind of mistake to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.430" end="00:01:30.479" style="s2">see it just through this political lens</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">which is I what I think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.479" end="00:01:33.689" style="s2">people and descriptions of it have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.689" end="00:01:38.340" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s ironic in a way because a</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">big one of the tenants of it is to move</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.340" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">beyond ideology and to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">these discussions which are you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">free from that for me the really</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">interesting thing is what happens or</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">what&#39;s the direction we start moving in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:50.579" style="s2">when we begin to have these</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.579" end="00:01:56.670" style="s2">beyond ideology this is where I think I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">and we have a different understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.670" end="00:02:01.770" style="s2">about it because I see it potentially</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:05.899" style="s2">moving towards a synthesis moving</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.770" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">towards a an intellectual synthesis and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.899" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">someone like Jordan Peterson is a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">good starting point for this because he</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">already synthesizes so many different</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.510" style="s2">ways of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:17.420" style="s2">he integrates evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.510" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">integrates psychology he integrates</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.420" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">mythology and religion and ends up in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">very similar place with all of them he</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:26.700" style="s2">then kind of also brings in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:28.049" style="s2">and says yeah well chaos and order even</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.700" end="00:02:29.519" style="s2">the brain is divided between chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.049" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">order look at Ian McGilchrist it&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.519" end="00:02:33.720" style="s2">the master in the emissary the left</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.579" style="s2">brain the right brain there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.720" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a real integration happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.579" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">already with someone like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.650" style="s2">Pederson there was a really amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:42.060" style="s2">podcast with the day on the day Rubin</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.650" end="00:02:44.010" style="s2">show with Ben Shapiro and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.060" end="00:02:46.170" style="s2">Peterson and then I&#39;ve seen another</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.010" end="00:02:49.980" style="s2">couple where Jordan Peterson was on Ben</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.170" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">Shapiro&#39;s podcast and what you see is</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.980" end="00:02:55.140" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like Jordan Peterson kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:56.940" style="s2">absorbed than Shapiro in a way because</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.140" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">venture Piero&#39;s argument is sort of from</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.940" end="00:03:01.290" style="s2">from revelation it&#39;s like okay we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:03.629" style="s2">these moral truths that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.290" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">given to us and Peterson was saying well</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.629" end="00:03:08.810" style="s2">these moral truths also evolved but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:11.879" style="s2">can look at kind of how morality evolves</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.810" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">but there is in some sense like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.879" end="00:03:15.390" style="s2">revelation from above and a morality</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">that evolves and the two come together</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.390" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">and that there&#39;s some sort of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:25.669" style="s2">like Peterson&#39;s conception of religion</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">and evolution and morality kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.669" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">encompass been Shapiro&#39;s perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:33.299" style="s2">he&#39;s able to say well yeah I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:34.410" style="s2">saying you&#39;re wrong Ben but I also think</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.299" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">you can get there from many different</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.410" end="00:03:39.540" style="s2">methods and that&#39;s all it was a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:41.430" style="s2">like amazing thing to see like you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.540" end="00:03:43.199" style="s2">just see the synthesis in action I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.430" end="00:03:44.819" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s slightly kind of maybe unfair</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.199" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2">to ben shapiro to say that Jordan Peters</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.819" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">absorbed it but Jordan Peterson had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.769" end="00:03:51.569" style="s2">biggest frame and Ben Shapiro had a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:53.340" style="s2">deep frame he&#39;s a very deep thinker but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.569" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">his frame was then encompassed within</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.340" end="00:03:59.459" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s and you could see the</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">the intellectual excitement of both of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.459" end="00:04:03.090" style="s2">them to have that conversation at then</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:04.440" style="s2">Shapiro in particular the respect that</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.090" end="00:04:05.069" style="s2">he had for Jordan Pederson and where he</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.440" end="00:04:07.949" style="s2">was coming from</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.069" end="00:04:09.690" style="s2">like really reframed and rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.949" end="00:04:11.579" style="s2">another level of depth potentially to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.690" end="00:04:15.090" style="s2">what what Ben Shapiro was already saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.579" end="00:04:17.039" style="s2">and you do see a lot of the guys in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.090" end="00:04:18.269" style="s2">intellectual dark web they have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.039" end="00:04:20.549" style="s2">conversations and then when you watch</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.269" end="00:04:21.690" style="s2">them on another podcast they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.549" end="00:04:23.980" style="s2">something that sounds an awful lot like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.690" end="00:04:25.030" style="s2">someone they&#39;ve heard before like so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.980" end="00:04:26.410" style="s2">people are sounding a lot more like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.030" end="00:04:29.620" style="s2">Jordan previous after we expect a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:32.590" style="s2">time with it so there this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.620" end="00:04:34.180" style="s2">feel the synthesis is is about but again</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.590" end="00:04:38.050" style="s2">it can only happen if people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.180" end="00:04:40.150" style="s2">prepared to to allow what is untrue to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.050" end="00:04:43.330" style="s2">burn off to do what Peterson says again</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.150" end="00:04:45.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like are you willing to allow what</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.330" end="00:04:48.820" style="s2">is false to burn off and to go through</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.190" end="00:04:51.660" style="s2">the process of yeah of growth which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.820" end="00:04:55.300" style="s2">always painful and I think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.660" end="00:04:56.950" style="s2">shared understanding between all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.300" end="00:04:58.180" style="s2">or between lots of the members of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.950" end="00:05:00.700" style="s2">intellectual dark web that there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.180" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">something called reality that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.700" end="00:05:04.840" style="s2">perceive that is independent of us as</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:07.630" style="s2">perceivers which is you know that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.840" end="00:05:08.920" style="s2">for me has a lot of the energy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.630" end="00:05:13.660" style="s2">excitement of it is moving away from</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.920" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">that postmodern mulch of radical radical</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.660" end="00:05:19.120" style="s2">relativity and that is a key thing if</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.790" style="s2">you want to burn away the Deadwood</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.120" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">because you have to that I mean inherent</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.790" end="00:05:25.390" style="s2">in that is the idea that there is there</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.400" style="s2">is something core beneath it and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.390" end="00:05:29.260" style="s2">there is something that is true so again</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.400" end="00:05:32.020" style="s2">it you know it is a reclaiming of truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.260" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">as well but I think a lot of them really</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.020" end="00:05:35.680" style="s2">share otherwise why talk to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:37.900" style="s2">somewhere you have to get towards</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.680" end="00:05:40.810" style="s2">something that is independent of all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.900" end="00:05:42.760" style="s2">us as perceivers and for me that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.810" end="00:05:44.230" style="s2">a lot of the power of it comes from and</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:45.700" style="s2">what&#39;s fascinating is that you just get</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.230" end="00:05:47.470" style="s2">a sense the people involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.700" end="00:05:49.000" style="s2">conversation recognize something is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.470" end="00:05:50.590" style="s2">happening it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.000" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">conversation it&#39;s becoming self-aware</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.590" end="00:05:54.460" style="s2">it&#39;s aware of itself and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.330" end="00:05:55.960" style="s2">excited by Dave Reubens the classic</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.460" end="00:05:57.130" style="s2">example is kind of like something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.960" end="00:05:59.260" style="s2">going on the Internet&#39;s full of</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.130" end="00:06:01.450" style="s2">foresters together and I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.260" end="00:06:05.560" style="s2">in kind of synchronicity but something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.450" end="00:06:07.540" style="s2">happening and and I I think it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.560" end="00:06:08.890" style="s2">a Great Awakening you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.540" end="00:06:10.480" style="s2">and I wonder whether you could almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.890" end="00:06:13.210" style="s2">return it it&#39;s a great intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.480" end="00:06:15.550" style="s2">awakening partly generated again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.210" end="00:06:17.200" style="s2">partly created by the internet ISM where</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.550" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2">we now have the possibilities have three</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.200" end="00:06:20.710" style="s2">our conversations we now have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:22.990" style="s2">possibility to kind of follow the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.710" end="00:06:24.760" style="s2">hole as far down as it goes we have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.990" end="00:06:27.640" style="s2">capability to now find it find ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.760" end="00:06:30.070" style="s2">outside the acceptable kind of surface</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.640" end="00:06:32.380" style="s2">level mainstream of the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:34.390" style="s2">and then go down these rabbit holes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.380" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">potentially be changed as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.390" end="00:06:38.700" style="s2">yeah I feel that energy with it when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:42.270" style="s2">watch it and just you know engage with</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.700" end="00:06:44.600" style="s2">it there is that sense of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.270" end="00:06:47.580" style="s2">electric sense of something happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.600" end="00:06:49.080" style="s2">for me it&#39;s about the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.580" end="00:06:50.460" style="s2">something happening it is something</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.080" end="00:06:51.570" style="s2">happening but it&#39;s the beginnings of</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.460" end="00:06:53.400" style="s2">something bigger and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.570" end="00:06:55.730" style="s2">where the excitement comes from like if</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.400" end="00:06:58.530" style="s2">you look at a lot of the key players</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.730" end="00:07:00.150" style="s2">they have had - they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.530" end="00:07:01.860" style="s2">their ideas in a very different way but</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.150" end="00:07:03.660" style="s2">they&#39;ve all had to embody their ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.860" end="00:07:05.820" style="s2">some degree like Brett Weinstein had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.660" end="00:07:07.830" style="s2">do something and stand up you know call</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.820" end="00:07:09.030" style="s2">it Jordan Peterson of course actually do</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.830" end="00:07:11.130" style="s2">a lot of things and it was under a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.030" end="00:07:13.320" style="s2">of pressure I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.130" end="00:07:14.610" style="s2">interesting thing about it is that these</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.320" end="00:07:16.410" style="s2">are people whose philosophy had to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.610" end="00:07:17.940" style="s2">embodied in some way and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.410" end="00:07:19.710" style="s2">the direction we&#39;re moving in that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.940" end="00:07:22.410" style="s2">really good idea that&#39;s a really smart</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.710" end="00:07:24.720" style="s2">way of looking at it because yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.410" end="00:07:27.660" style="s2">like these people have had to live out</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.720" end="00:07:29.040" style="s2">their philosophies and Bret and Eric</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.660" end="00:07:30.540" style="s2">Weinstein talked about it on the day</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.040" end="00:07:32.070" style="s2">Reuben podcast which is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.540" end="00:07:36.030" style="s2">podcast watch it you haven&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.070" end="00:07:38.220" style="s2">already the what you&#39;ve had is almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.030" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">this selection process for people who</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.220" end="00:07:42.300" style="s2">are thinking outside the box because if</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:43.440" style="s2">you if you insist that everyone uses a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.300" end="00:07:44.790" style="s2">certain set of pronouns I like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:48.030" style="s2">Jordan Peter certainly you insist that</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.790" end="00:07:49.470" style="s2">all white professors don&#39;t come into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.030" end="00:07:52.010" style="s2">college on a certain day as they did</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.470" end="00:07:55.190" style="s2">with Brett Weinstein what you&#39;d find is</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.010" end="00:07:57.540" style="s2">the people who are prepared to say no</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.190" end="00:07:59.400" style="s2">are prepared to stand out against the</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.540" end="00:08:01.590" style="s2">herd they are exactly the kind of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.400" end="00:08:03.930" style="s2">who you need who are almost certain to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.590" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">have created something extraordinary in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.930" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">their work because they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:10.380" style="s2">thinking differently and also I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:12.180" style="s2">you also sort of touch on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.380" end="00:08:14.790" style="s2">this is the start of a conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.180" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">there is a deeper synthesis that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.790" end="00:08:19.650" style="s2">potentially there they&#39;re moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:22.770" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s many levels to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.650" end="00:08:24.660" style="s2">conversation and the intellectual dart</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.770" end="00:08:27.540" style="s2">lab is sort of the it&#39;s almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.660" end="00:08:30.180" style="s2">holding concept for the ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.540" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2">conversation and it is a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.180" end="00:08:35.070" style="s2">you&#39;ve got throughout this this summer</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">and this year and ongoing you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.070" end="00:08:39.240" style="s2">lot of these guys in conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:41.070" style="s2">each other in very public venues and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:44.280" style="s2">effectively what what we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.070" end="00:08:46.650" style="s2">kind of intellectual content becoming</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.280" end="00:08:48.209" style="s2">like this happened a comedy in the 90</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.650" end="00:08:49.649" style="s2">suddenly comedy came</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.209" end="00:08:51.449" style="s2">the small clubs and was now kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.649" end="00:08:53.069" style="s2">selling out the o2 arena and Wembley and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.449" end="00:08:54.360" style="s2">all this sort of stuff and this is now</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.069" end="00:08:59.369" style="s2">happening with intellectual content</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.360" end="00:09:00.929" style="s2">which has to be a good thing but also so</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.369" end="00:09:03.269" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the sense of okay this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.929" end="00:09:06.029" style="s2">conversation is happening but if this</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.269" end="00:09:09.720" style="s2">conversation is not an open inquiry then</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.029" end="00:09:11.339" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna fail I think and this is up</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.720" end="00:09:13.649" style="s2">to everyone in the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.339" end="00:09:15.059" style="s2">to make sure that this is the case it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.649" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">like so that what is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.059" end="00:09:20.220" style="s2">conversation how do you have a meta</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:22.709" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s genuinely generative</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.220" end="00:09:25.050" style="s2">that&#39;s genuinely kind of potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.709" end="00:09:26.970" style="s2">finding a resolution and you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.050" end="00:09:28.709" style="s2">the people involved like it takes a huge</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.970" end="00:09:30.509" style="s2">amount of intellectual courage for</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.709" end="00:09:31.920" style="s2">someone like sam harris to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.509" end="00:09:35.220" style="s2">maybe I was a bit I was wrong about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.920" end="00:09:37.649" style="s2">atheist thing he&#39;s made an entire career</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.220" end="00:09:39.179" style="s2">and wrote several books about this so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.649" end="00:09:41.670" style="s2">think at some point he&#39;s at least gonna</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.179" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">have to refrain kind of what he means</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.670" end="00:09:45.509" style="s2">and accept that some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:48.929" style="s2">metaphorical truth is also valuable as</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.509" end="00:09:52.410" style="s2">well as scientific truth so this sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.929" end="00:09:54.360" style="s2">of like open inquiry is is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.410" end="00:09:56.339" style="s2">important it&#39;s like am i open to new</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.360" end="00:09:57.600" style="s2">information or do I just keep trying to</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.339" end="00:09:59.970" style="s2">kind of filter everything into what I</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.600" end="00:10:02.279" style="s2">already think well you&#39;re not really an</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.970" end="00:10:04.799" style="s2">intellectual unless you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.279" end="00:10:07.049" style="s2">release your previously held notions</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.799" end="00:10:08.610" style="s2">when new information comes to light</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.049" end="00:10:12.059" style="s2">that&#39;s what if that&#39;s what it really</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.610" end="00:10:14.040" style="s2">should be I think and just just on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.059" end="00:10:15.990" style="s2">on the rock stadium kind of feel of it</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.040" end="00:10:18.179" style="s2">you know I was just thinking you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.990" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">think it&#39;s interesting to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.179" end="00:10:23.790" style="s2">energy that drives that many people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">want to go instead of seeing a concert</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.790" end="00:10:27.720" style="s2">see an intellectual talk and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:30.179" style="s2">strikes me about the whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.720" end="00:10:32.490" style="s2">about what they&#39;re doing on one level is</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.179" end="00:10:34.740" style="s2">it&#39;s an inquiry into reality because</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.490" end="00:10:37.379" style="s2">increasingly in a kind of post truth</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.740" end="00:10:40.170" style="s2">world we don&#39;t have a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.379" end="00:10:42.899" style="s2">reality is you know practically</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.170" end="00:10:44.309" style="s2">politically metaphysically and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.899" end="00:10:46.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep hunger for that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.309" end="00:10:49.589" style="s2">that&#39;s again why that inquiry has to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.889" end="00:10:51.749" style="s2">remain open because reality is bigger</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.589" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">than the person perceiving it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.749" end="00:10:55.049" style="s2">contrary to the postmodern world view</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:57.480" style="s2">which would say no it&#39;s it&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.049" end="00:10:59.400" style="s2">perceptions as the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.480" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">continue I hope</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.400" end="00:11:05.190" style="s2">that what we will start to see is a real</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:06.150" style="s2">is a growing synthesis between these</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.190" end="00:11:07.650" style="s2">different perspectives and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.150" end="00:11:09.240" style="s2">intellectual dark web and these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.650" end="00:11:10.260" style="s2">really deep perspective this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.240" end="00:11:13.110" style="s2">another mistake to look at it through</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.260" end="00:11:15.690" style="s2">the political lens is that these these</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.110" end="00:11:17.580" style="s2">guys go right to the bedrock my Petersen</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.690" end="00:11:19.890" style="s2">goes right to the bedrock Brett</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:27.380" style="s2">Eric Weinstein is a superstar</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.820" end="00:11:29.670" style="s2">mathematician who I think probably has a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.380" end="00:11:30.960" style="s2">very different take on it because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.670" end="00:11:32.670" style="s2">seeing sort of he&#39;s seeing almost like</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.960" end="00:11:35.400" style="s2">the source code and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.670" end="00:11:36.900" style="s2">probably why he originated that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.400" end="00:11:38.250" style="s2">whole concept of the intellectual dart</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:42.090" style="s2">web because he&#39;s seeing quite a long way</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.250" end="00:11:44.550" style="s2">down the track but there&#39;s a few things</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.090" end="00:11:46.980" style="s2">that then are holding up that synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.550" end="00:11:49.860" style="s2">for example of jordan peterson and sam</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.980" end="00:11:53.310" style="s2">harris there&#39;s a huge that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.860" end="00:11:56.970" style="s2">really interesting conversation cuz cuz</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.310" end="00:11:59.790" style="s2">if if they&#39;re both willing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.970" end="00:12:03.210" style="s2">work and to give up like sam harris in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.790" end="00:12:04.920" style="s2">very difficult position because i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.210" end="00:12:07.710" style="s2">ultimately he is going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.920" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">concede that there are mythological</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.710" end="00:12:13.890" style="s2">truths in religion as brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.700" style="s2">says they are mythologically true or</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.890" end="00:12:17.610" style="s2">what&#39;d he say</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.700" end="00:12:20.370" style="s2">they&#39;re metaphorically true but literary</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">literally false sam house had been very</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.370" end="00:12:24.270" style="s2">resistant to that perspective but i I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:26.250" style="s2">think going as this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.270" end="00:12:27.630" style="s2">continues he&#39;s gonna find it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.250" end="00:12:30.750" style="s2">increasingly difficult to defend that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.630" end="00:12:32.610" style="s2">position so just a reverse back a bit to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.750" end="00:12:34.230" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying a second ago for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.610" end="00:12:37.950" style="s2">one of the really interesting questions</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.230" end="00:12:40.530" style="s2">is is it a synthesis like it is I think</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.950" end="00:12:42.330" style="s2">a synthesis but also the way paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.530" end="00:12:44.370" style="s2">shifts the way you know kuhn pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.330" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">paradigm shifts happen or when the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.370" end="00:12:47.790" style="s2">existing paradigm there&#39;s so much that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.320" end="00:12:50.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t fit into it that the pressure</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.790" end="00:12:52.560" style="s2">builds and eventually new one forms so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.100" end="00:12:54.270" style="s2">I&#39;m just wondering where the you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.560" end="00:12:58.290" style="s2">you just talked about Peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.270" end="00:13:00.480" style="s2">Harris in a sense some worldview has to</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.290" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">give in in some way you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.480" end="00:13:05.280" style="s2">materialist paradigm potentially has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">give to something beyond that something</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.280" end="00:13:09.840" style="s2">that integrates that but moves beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:12.500" style="s2">and recognizes for example religion</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.840" end="00:13:15.480" style="s2">and the transcendent so for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.500" end="00:13:18.420" style="s2">that&#39;s where it could go is that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.480" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">synthesis also leads to something</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.420" end="00:13:23.520" style="s2">shifting fundamentally in the way we</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.930" style="s2">communicate and the way we you know an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.520" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">ideas revolution as they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.930" end="00:13:30.230" style="s2">you know for me that requires some</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">synthesis first but then some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.230" end="00:13:35.940" style="s2">radical reevaluation as well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">how the hell do we find a way through</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.940" end="00:13:40.920" style="s2">that chaos and how do we see reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:43.589" style="s2">more clearly and I think that is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.920" end="00:13:45.510" style="s2">overwhelming urge for millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.589" end="00:13:48.570" style="s2">right now how do we see reality more</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.510" end="00:13:51.540" style="s2">clearly and yeah to your point it has to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.570" end="00:13:53.670" style="s2">be done in a flexible open way because</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.540" end="00:13:56.310" style="s2">reality is constantly shifting and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.670" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">think Peterson in particular understands</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.310" end="00:14:00.750" style="s2">that but he talks about the humility of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">understanding that you don&#39;t know enough</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.750" end="00:14:05.820" style="s2">by definition that in a way God is fear</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:07.620" style="s2">of God he talked about the interview</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.820" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">divided with him like what&#39;s what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.620" end="00:14:12.570" style="s2">real key to to true knowledge and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:15.000" style="s2">suggested that kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.570" end="00:14:16.350" style="s2">courage was a big part of that and kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.000" end="00:14:18.900" style="s2">of embodied knowledge as a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.350" end="00:14:21.150" style="s2">that and he said that fear of God was</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.900" end="00:14:22.950" style="s2">the beginning of wisdom and what he</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.150" end="00:14:25.710" style="s2">meant by that was you always have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.950" end="00:14:27.870" style="s2">remember as if your life depends on it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.710" end="00:14:32.339" style="s2">because it does that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.870" end="00:14:34.080" style="s2">enough and so there&#39;s it requires that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.339" end="00:14:36.839" style="s2">kind of level of humility so to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.080" end="00:14:39.360" style="s2">summarize we think that the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.839" end="00:14:41.910" style="s2">dark lever is a kind of placeholder for</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.360" end="00:14:44.220" style="s2">an ongoing conversation that hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.910" end="00:14:47.160" style="s2">will approach some kind of synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.220" end="00:14:48.540" style="s2">like intellectual synthesis able to jump</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.160" end="00:14:49.560" style="s2">between evolutionary biology and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.540" end="00:14:51.570" style="s2">psychology and all these different</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.560" end="00:14:53.430" style="s2">things but ultimately saying well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.570" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">looking at the same thing this is how</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.430" end="00:14:59.310" style="s2">the world is but we can look at these</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:15:01.410" style="s2">different ways mathematics and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.310" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">ironing out at the moment hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.410" end="00:15:04.680" style="s2">ironing out all of this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:06.260" style="s2">disagreements between them Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.680" end="00:15:08.730" style="s2">you and Peterson all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.260" end="00:15:12.390" style="s2">with the hope that they can reach this</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.730" end="00:15:16.440" style="s2">kind of synthesis where does it go if</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.390" end="00:15:19.530" style="s2">that&#39;s true what is what what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.440" end="00:15:21.959" style="s2">I think ultimately the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.530" end="00:15:22.930" style="s2">synthesis is only one part and what</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.959" end="00:15:25.180" style="s2">needs to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.930" end="00:15:27.100" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s an embodied synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.180" end="00:15:28.990" style="s2">that needs to come come in as well and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a danger of it just</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.990" end="00:15:34.540" style="s2">becoming an intellectual thing whereas</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:36.370" style="s2">actually we know things are that core</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.540" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">like we don&#39;t know things from here we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.370" end="00:15:40.360" style="s2">know things in our gut we know things in</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:43.200" style="s2">our emotions and there&#39;s an embodied</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.360" end="00:15:46.149" style="s2">there&#39;s an embodied nature to true</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.200" end="00:15:48.459" style="s2">knowing so I&#39;m looking at people like</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.149" end="00:15:50.680" style="s2">who are now not considered it part of</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.459" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">the intellectual diet web but I think a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.680" end="00:15:54.850" style="s2">holding really key parts of the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:57.220" style="s2">Richard Tarn as I mentioned before I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.850" end="00:16:00.570" style="s2">think kind of named it all really really</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.220" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">clearly back in the seventies I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.570" end="00:16:06.100" style="s2">know a bit later if he was actually not</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:08.050" style="s2">in the 90s you&#39;ve got people like Stan</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.100" end="00:16:10.120" style="s2">Grof who&#39;ve been working with</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.050" end="00:16:14.230" style="s2">psychedelic therapy and transformational</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.120" end="00:16:16.029" style="s2">work since the since the 50s Jamie will</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.230" end="00:16:18.279" style="s2">who we interviewed and we&#39;re about to</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.029" end="00:16:20.860" style="s2">bring out another interview with soon he</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.279" end="00:16:24.279" style="s2">he&#39;s a he works with flow states and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.860" end="00:16:27.400" style="s2">works with transformational states that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.279" end="00:16:28.930" style="s2">I think is is is where we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.400" end="00:16:31.000" style="s2">there are things we cannot understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.930" end="00:16:34.330" style="s2">with just our minds and coming into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.000" end="00:16:35.950" style="s2">body and also living and you know acting</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.330" end="00:16:37.779" style="s2">out and putting these things into our</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.950" end="00:16:40.209" style="s2">lives which you know Peterson talks</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.779" end="00:16:42.400" style="s2">about a lot that is really for me the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.209" end="00:16:45.910" style="s2">next stage and philosophy used to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.400" end="00:16:48.339" style="s2">like that before before Plato in</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.910" end="00:16:49.930" style="s2">particular where it became about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.339" end="00:16:51.730" style="s2">a discussion of ideas and they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.930" end="00:16:53.950" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s have a dialectic and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.730" end="00:16:56.680" style="s2">you know discuss these ideas which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.950" end="00:16:58.660" style="s2">important but it&#39;s not enough it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.680" end="00:17:00.250" style="s2">enough they have to be lived as</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.660" end="00:17:02.830" style="s2">something else happens when you do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.250" end="00:17:05.050" style="s2">something very different happens and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.830" end="00:17:07.270" style="s2">changes how we are in the world and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.050" end="00:17:09.850" style="s2">also frees us from ideology and in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.270" end="00:17:12.339" style="s2">very new way because ideology is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.850" end="00:17:15.429" style="s2">of of the ego in the mind so if you stay</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.339" end="00:17:17.290" style="s2">up there you can&#39;t undo ideology with</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.429" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">the mind really it comes from a much</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.290" end="00:17:20.050" style="s2">deeper level and that&#39;s why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:21.850" style="s2">exciting to explore all these different</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.050" end="00:17:24.130" style="s2">thinkers who are really at the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.850" end="00:17:25.420" style="s2">edge of those practices and the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.130" end="00:17:28.360" style="s2">edge of the science behind it as well</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.420" end="00:17:30.220" style="s2">and also why we are increasingly doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.360" end="00:17:33.429" style="s2">workshops yeah rebel wisdom has always</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.220" end="00:17:34.790" style="s2">had the intellectual content and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.429" end="00:17:37.700" style="s2">film&#39;s but also the work</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.790" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">shops and we&#39;re expanding that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.700" end="00:17:42.590" style="s2">some amazing facilitators coming in</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:44.260" style="s2">Louise Mazzanti from the glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.590" end="00:17:47.960" style="s2">matrix film and we&#39;ve done a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.260" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">interesting interviews with her might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.960" end="00:17:53.870" style="s2">solder raffia Turia we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:56.360" style="s2">amazing people who have kind of going to</p>
