<p begin="00:00:05.580" end="00:00:08.550" style="s2">We all know that factory farms are<br />terrible but what about eating animals</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.550" end="00:00:10.500" style="s2">that come from free range farms or from hunting?</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.500" end="00:00:15.379" style="s2">If all we succeeded at was<br />stopping the factory farms I&#39;d be so</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.379" end="00:00:15.920" style="s2">happy. Because an animal that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.890" end="00:00:23.560" style="s2">living in a natural environment and<br />really getting to experience its</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.560" end="00:00:25.490" style="s2">sovereignty and its direction of its<br />life and then gets killed hopefully quickly,</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.500" end="00:00:31.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a radically different experience<br />than an animal</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.900" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">that is really enslaved and enslaved</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:39.910" style="s2">in poor to terrible to atrocious<br />conditions for its whole life and then killed in</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.910" end="00:00:45.100" style="s2">very often a very brutal way. If<br />we only made that shift that would be so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.100" end="00:00:48.030" style="s2">humongous. So much of the atrocity<br />would be addressed.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.030" end="00:00:51.950" style="s2">Then the question comes, is that the only<br />shift worth making?</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.950" end="00:00:56.370" style="s2">Is that all the shift? For me as much respect as I have for</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.370" end="00:01:00.850" style="s2">the Native American kind of ethic, I<br />also notice that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.850" end="00:01:04.219" style="s2">in areas where there was more</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.219" end="00:01:08.579" style="s2">pre-agriculture, in areas where there was<br />more natural edible plant life,</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.579" end="00:01:12.229" style="s2">there was less animal consumption. And in<br />areas where there is less natural, edible</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.229" end="00:01:14.570" style="s2">plant life there was more animal<br />consumption because that&#39;s what the people had to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.570" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">do to adapt and live there.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:20.700" style="s2">We totally understand. Post-agriculture, were we have the ability to grow</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.700" end="00:01:24.390" style="s2">everything we need plant-wise, then</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.390" end="00:01:27.440" style="s2">if that produces less suffering,</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.440" end="00:01:30.990" style="s2">less less harm than killing more<br />sentient creatures,</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.990" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">then is there really a justification for<br />continuing the animal thing? For me there isn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.250" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">We talk about the idea of humane<br />slaughter</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:43.070" style="s2">and it really is an oxymoron and all you<br />have to do to recognize that is ask, </p>
<p begin="00:01:43.070" end="00:01:44.770" style="s2">would you be okay being on the other<br />side of it?</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.770" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">In morality there&#39;s a famous test </p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:49.060" style="s2">called the pie slice theorem. </p>
<p begin="00:01:52.060" end="00:01:55.270" style="s2">Is something really ethical, is<br />something fair? It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.270" end="00:01:56.259" style="s2">you slice the pie, you pick what the two sides are,</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.409" end="00:02:01.070" style="s2">and I get to pick which one</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.070" end="00:02:04.430" style="s2"> I want, or I slice and you pick, but that way we avoid bias.</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.430" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">We need to ask, are we setting up a dynamic for how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:12.299" style="s2">tend to animals where we would be okay being in their position and if the answer is no, </p>
<p begin="00:02:12.299" end="00:02:16.000" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t want to live for I was<br />taken care of pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.000" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">and then murdered quickly, then the<br />answer is they wouldn&#39;t want that either</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:24.489" style="s2">and if it was necessary then we have to<br />look at justifying it but if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.489" end="00:02:26.840" style="s2">necessary there&#39;s really no<br />justification for it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.840" end="00:02:30.849" style="s2">That really is the key, to get</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.849" end="00:02:34.910" style="s2">is that no animal has ever voluntarily<br />but their head on the chopping block and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.910" end="00:02:37.450" style="s2">if they knew that was coming would do<br />everything in their power to get away from it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.030" end="00:02:41.629" style="s2">and just because we have the power to<br />take their life away do we have the right?</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.250" end="00:02:45.540" style="s2">And if we need to,</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.540" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">you know if there&#39;s a situation where we<br />are in a survival situation, we have no</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">other resources and we&#39;re going to die or they&#39;re going to die, </p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">it&#39;s a totally different story. If someone really didn&#39;t know how to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:02:57.989" style="s2">healthy otherwise it&#39;s a different story.</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.989" end="00:03:01.390" style="s2">But if it&#39;s simply a preference for us<br />but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.390" end="00:03:05.340" style="s2">the whole possibility for life for them them,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.340" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">then I don&#39;t think we can ethically justify that.</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:11.620" style="s2">I think it&#39;s something that you find consistent through all forms of life,</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.620" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">from the most complex to the most basic, is that every</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:18.519" style="s2">animal wants to live, at the end of the<br />day</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.519" end="00:03:21.739" style="s2">there isn&#39;t any animal that doesn&#39;t want<br />it</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.739" end="00:03:25.629" style="s2">to have placed and to experience life<br />what its</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.629" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a fundamental impulse apply for<br />biology is to continue writing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">propagate in</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:33.450" style="s2">I&#39;m and we think about are</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.450" end="00:03:36.989" style="s2">desires everything we wanted everything<br />we don&#39;t want to talk contingent</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.989" end="00:03:40.670" style="s2">upon life right and without that<br />everything else is gone so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.670" end="00:03:44.420" style="s2">it is Adam other their children and to<br />be social and two</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.420" end="00:03:48.190" style="s2">experience anything that one experience<br />is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.190" end="00:03:51.629" style="s2">on the foundation of their ability to<br />live in such take that away</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.629" end="00:03:55.190" style="s2">for just I like the way it tastes right<br />or something that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.190" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">so surface in our hierarchy of needs</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s at the core at their hierarchy<br />of needs means that we have to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.319" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">their life so unimportant in our eyes</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:09.269" style="s2">did their whole right to life is worth<br />less than something</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.269" end="00:04:14.220" style="s2">relatively trivial to us and if we&#39;re<br />willing to take another feeling life</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.220" end="00:04:15.700" style="s2">forms and me make</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.700" end="00:04:19.819" style="s2">their whole experience that trivial then<br />there&#39;s a bleed over affect where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.819" end="00:04:21.049" style="s2">start doing that with other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.049" end="00:04:24.139" style="s2">right we start doing that with anything<br />else we start thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.139" end="00:04:27.229" style="s2">the restive life as a commodity for us<br />rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.229" end="00:04:32.069" style="s2">other sovereign life under their own<br />right to life we&#39;re not thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.069" end="00:04:35.289" style="s2">what is it what is it what does it feel<br />what is a trait like how can I support</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.289" end="00:04:37.789" style="s2">it having a full life experience in this<br />universe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.789" end="00:04:41.779" style="s2">what is in it for me and even if it<br />requires harming it hurting it how can I</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.779" end="00:04:43.089" style="s2">get what I want out of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.089" end="00:04:47.180" style="s2">we start thinking that way in the area<br />it leads to way of thinking that leads</p>
