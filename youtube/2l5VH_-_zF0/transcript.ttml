<p begin="00:02:46.480" end="00:02:53.290" style="s2">is happen so many times oh I went have</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:56.590" style="s2">this epiphany this week really yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.290" end="00:02:59.500" style="s2">of how I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been struggling</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.590" end="00:03:02.260" style="s2">with coven 19 quarantine whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.500" end="00:03:04.180" style="s2">calling it as I&#39;m sure everybody has but</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.260" end="00:03:06.310" style="s2">I was struggling with my struggling</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.180" end="00:03:08.170" style="s2">because I shouldn&#39;t be this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.310" end="00:03:10.270" style="s2">my life this is what I do all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.170" end="00:03:12.010" style="s2">almost all the time besides of course</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.270" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">not being able to my kid that can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.010" end="00:03:17.290" style="s2">to school and I can&#39;t go to cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:19.959" style="s2">but other than that this is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.290" end="00:03:23.800" style="s2">similar except that I haven&#39;t been going</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.959" end="00:03:24.850" style="s2">out for my walks which are very</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.800" end="00:03:27.100" style="s2">important I mean they&#39;re the only</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.850" end="00:03:30.760" style="s2">exercise I really get plus they are just</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.100" end="00:03:32.290" style="s2">like mentally I need them mentally</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.760" end="00:03:34.810" style="s2">spiritually emotionally they&#39;re needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.290" end="00:03:36.670" style="s2">and I can go out in them but it was like</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.810" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t because I don&#39;t know there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.670" end="00:03:41.260" style="s2">like this subconscious need to like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:43.330" style="s2">everyone&#39;s life was here before pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.260" end="00:03:45.010" style="s2">and then everyone&#39;s kind of like got</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.330" end="00:03:46.510" style="s2">miserable having to stay at home so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.010" end="00:03:49.540" style="s2">like I needed to equate that miss your</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.510" end="00:03:52.120" style="s2">progress like everyone&#39;s life let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.540" end="00:03:55.030" style="s2">went down to 25% somehow I felt I needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.120" end="00:03:56.350" style="s2">to go down at least like 75% which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.030" end="00:03:59.140" style="s2">ridiculous because my life is actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.350" end="00:04:00.910" style="s2">conducive to the quarantine pretty</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.140" end="00:04:03.400" style="s2">pretty similar so I could keep my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.910" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">lifestyle more or less so why aren&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.400" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">and part of it was again the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:13.450" style="s2">subconscious that everyone else staying</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:15.190" style="s2">home had this impact on me because it</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.450" end="00:04:18.450" style="s2">was simultaneously everyone&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.190" end="00:04:20.890" style="s2">productive at home that I am and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.450" end="00:04:24.700" style="s2">everyone&#39;s miserable at home when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.890" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">actually in a lot of ways my highest</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.700" end="00:04:27.210" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.910" style="s2">where a lot of my ideas have come from</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.210" end="00:04:32.850" style="s2">it&#39;s where although force like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.910" end="00:04:36.780" style="s2">like the pandemic I have found a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.850" end="00:04:37.980" style="s2">beauty and purpose in it but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.780" end="00:04:40.380" style="s2">that other people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.980" end="00:04:41.850" style="s2">isn&#39;t a reflection on mine and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.380" end="00:04:44.820" style="s2">that other people were productive is in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.850" end="00:04:48.900" style="s2">a reflection online and the misery that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.820" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">was coming from that was from me</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.900" end="00:04:52.350" style="s2">comparing myself right other people are</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:57.450" style="s2">more productive people are more</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.350" end="00:04:58.890" style="s2">miserable than I have and so now that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.450" end="00:05:00.420" style="s2">know that it&#39;s like right I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.890" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">to confirm myself to other people I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.420" end="00:05:03.900" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be baking bread I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">need you to in Pinterest all I need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.900" end="00:05:09.030" style="s2">do is follow the next right step and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:11.850" style="s2">it&#39;s okay if people are miserable this</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.030" end="00:05:13.260" style="s2">isn&#39;t their thing this isn&#39;t all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.850" end="00:05:15.750" style="s2">humanity probably doesn&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.260" end="00:05:17.580" style="s2">course of action to stay at home and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.750" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">hopefully I can offer some people</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.580" end="00:05:22.050" style="s2">whoever find the message when I&#39;m ready</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:24.390" style="s2">to give it in is it&#39;s the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.050" end="00:05:25.740" style="s2">they can find purpose in beauty at being</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.390" end="00:05:27.720" style="s2">at home and I think a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.740" end="00:05:30.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s all of it and I do feel all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.720" end="00:05:33.150" style="s2">it I feel the isolation and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.690" end="00:05:37.140" style="s2">difficulty of doing it and I also feel</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.150" end="00:05:40.350" style="s2">the see the beauty and and I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.140" end="00:05:43.020" style="s2">lot from my time having to be at home by</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.350" end="00:05:46.830" style="s2">myself a lot of the time before before</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.020" end="00:05:49.530" style="s2">this so that was just my realization and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.830" end="00:05:51.870" style="s2">in that so yesterday I was like okay I</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.980" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">had no time to myself him to less monk I</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.050" end="00:06:22.770" style="s2">don&#39;t think I really realized that and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:24.750" style="s2">so prioritizing going out and going for</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.770" end="00:06:28.590" style="s2">a walk the place I normally go for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.750" end="00:06:31.050" style="s2">walk his around this publicly owned Golf</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.590" end="00:06:34.740" style="s2">Course and I because you are closing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.050" end="00:06:36.300" style="s2">you&#39;re passing other people on a trail I</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.740" end="00:06:38.580" style="s2">was like is it gonna be closed I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.300" end="00:06:39.280" style="s2">know so I walked over there and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.580" end="00:06:40.570" style="s2">they had</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.280" end="00:06:42.430" style="s2">stitute because it&#39;s one big loop so</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.570" end="00:06:44.170" style="s2">they had instituted a one-way policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.430" end="00:06:45.850" style="s2">that you have to go one way and I was</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.170" end="00:06:48.760" style="s2">like that&#39;s clea that make sense but</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.850" end="00:06:51.340" style="s2">only runners and joggers can be on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.760" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">path and then they opened up the golf</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.340" end="00:06:55.960" style="s2">course to everybody else so everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:57.430" style="s2">who&#39;s walking or just like you know your</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.960" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">kids on a bike or your kids on a scooter</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.430" end="00:07:00.370" style="s2">they weren&#39;t really clear that bikes</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:04.840" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed so there was definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.370" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">people on bikes in there and so I walked</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.840" end="00:07:08.169" style="s2">around barefoot on a golf course</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:10.389" style="s2">yesterday cuz it was exactly what I</p>

<p begin="00:07:12.340" end="00:07:15.820" style="s2">grass but generally you can&#39;t really do</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.930" end="00:07:17.530" style="s2">it because it&#39;s hard grass and it&#39;s</p>
