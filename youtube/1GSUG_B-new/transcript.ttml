<p begin="00:12:04.870" end="00:12:11.110" style="s2">have said I&#39;ve got this new thing called</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.040" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">pigeon hole and that&#39;s enabled people to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">vote up questions and then I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:18.780" style="s2">going to take some of the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:22.150" style="s2">are on you know that are streaming in so</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.780" end="00:12:24.990" style="s2">so hopefully that&#39;ll all work see if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.150" end="00:12:28.330" style="s2">in focus not too bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.990" end="00:12:30.130" style="s2">all right there we go</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.330" end="00:12:31.690" style="s2">consider the overwhelming success of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.130" end="00:12:33.190" style="s2">patreon account the money raised by</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.690" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">rebel what will you be doing with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.190" end="00:12:37.390" style="s2">contributions well that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:40.800" style="s2">all right so I&#39;ve got a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.390" end="00:12:43.690" style="s2">to say about that so the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.800" end="00:12:45.220" style="s2">you know I would say a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.690" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">have been attempted and not an</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.220" end="00:12:48.130" style="s2">overwhelming number but a number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.600" end="00:12:50.200" style="s2">people have been attempting to take me</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.130" end="00:12:52.300" style="s2">to task for the fact that my patreon</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.200" end="00:12:55.390" style="s2">support has been let&#39;s call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.300" end="00:12:58.360" style="s2">overwhelmingly successful and and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.390" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you how I formulate my</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.360" end="00:13:04.180" style="s2">response to that the first is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.810" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">generating almost all of my content and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.180" end="00:13:09.340" style="s2">making it completely publicly accessible</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s free right and and so that way</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.340" end="00:13:14.380" style="s2">I&#39;m bringing I think awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:16.360" style="s2">psychological issues to a very large</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.380" end="00:13:18.340" style="s2">number of people and so far at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.360" end="00:13:21.340" style="s2">moment my view count on YouTube is up to</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.340" end="00:13:23.200" style="s2">13 million and I did a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.340" end="00:13:27.460" style="s2">calculations last week to try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.200" end="00:13:29.920" style="s2">out what the total view count was for</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.460" end="00:13:31.540" style="s2">the cuts of my lectures that have been</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.920" end="00:13:33.190" style="s2">appearing on YouTube and then the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.540" end="00:13:35.650" style="s2">political material as well and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.190" end="00:13:37.150" style="s2">it&#39;s upward of 50 million and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.650" end="00:13:39.490" style="s2">making psychological and political</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.150" end="00:13:41.230" style="s2">content available to 50 million people</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.490" end="00:13:44.440" style="s2">and so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.230" end="00:13:45.430" style="s2">like a reasonable thing to do now people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.440" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">who don&#39;t agree with what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.430" end="00:13:49.570" style="s2">might differ but I think that could be</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.450" style="s2">separated from the educational content</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.570" end="00:13:55.390" style="s2">as well so and then with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.450" end="00:13:56.740" style="s2">patreon subscribers every single person</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.390" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">who&#39;s doing that is doing it entirely</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.740" end="00:14:00.520" style="s2">voluntarily and I also set up that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:04.570" style="s2">patreon account long before any of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.520" end="00:14:07.090" style="s2">political material emerged so and my</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.570" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">sense with the patreon viewers and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.090" end="00:14:10.270" style="s2">guys can clue me in if I&#39;m wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.150" style="s2">this is that there&#39;s two things</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.270" end="00:14:14.830" style="s2">happening as one is it enables people</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.150" end="00:14:18.360" style="s2">who are not very happy about the current</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.830" end="00:14:22.420" style="s2">political situation in the West to to to</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.360" end="00:14:25.420" style="s2">contribute to something that might be at</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.420" end="00:14:27.310" style="s2">least to some degree attempting to stem</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.420" end="00:14:30.550" style="s2">the tide of such things as toxic</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.310" end="00:14:33.280" style="s2">political correctness and second that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.550" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">enables people to support my endeavors</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.280" end="00:14:37.840" style="s2">to bring general education to a wider</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:39.430" style="s2">audience and that seems like a good deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.840" end="00:14:41.260" style="s2">for everyone and you know you might say</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.430" end="00:14:43.000" style="s2">well it&#39;s a particularly good deal for</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.260" end="00:14:44.710" style="s2">me and I&#39;m certainly not complaining</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.000" end="00:14:48.400" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening but I would also</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.710" end="00:14:56.620" style="s2">point out that it hasn&#39;t exactly been a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.400" end="00:14:58.060" style="s2">straightforward thing and so so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.620" end="00:15:00.010" style="s2">if anyone else wants to try it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.060" end="00:15:04.210" style="s2">more than welcome to now having said</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.010" end="00:15:06.850" style="s2">that I would also say that the real</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.210" end="00:15:08.590" style="s2">issue here and I think this is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.850" end="00:15:10.930" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t self-evident is also a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.590" end="00:15:12.580" style="s2">commentary on the toxicity of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.930" end="00:15:14.320" style="s2">culture at the moment is that it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.580" end="00:15:17.860" style="s2">actually isn&#39;t the issue the issue isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.320" end="00:15:19.480" style="s2">really how much money you have I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.860" end="00:15:21.670" style="s2">that that&#39;s a resentful and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.480" end="00:15:24.460" style="s2">relatively vicious way of judging</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.670" end="00:15:25.690" style="s2">someone else I think the issue is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.460" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">you do with the money when you have it</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.690" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m not a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:33.370" style="s2">hedonistic person and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:35.080" style="s2">twenty-five years old you know I&#39;m 55</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.370" end="00:15:36.850" style="s2">years old and I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.080" end="00:15:40.750" style="s2">grandfather in a couple of months you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.850" end="00:15:42.670" style="s2">know thank God for that and what I want</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.750" end="00:15:44.230" style="s2">to do with that money is to do the best</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.670" end="00:15:45.640" style="s2">things I can possibly think of to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.230" end="00:15:47.050" style="s2">with it and one of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.640" end="00:15:49.090" style="s2">thinking about I started this biblical</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.050" end="00:15:51.700" style="s2">series and a lot of that&#39;s help thankful</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.090" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">thanks to you guys on patreon because</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.700" end="00:15:55.100" style="s2">that enabled me to generate the capital</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:56.960" style="s2">that was necessary to rent</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.100" end="00:15:59.090" style="s2">Theatre because for 12 lectures that was</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.960" end="00:16:00.730" style="s2">a $60,000 investment about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.090" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">something like that and then another</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">$8,000 for that for the camerawork and</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:08.720" style="s2">that had to be basically dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:12.830" style="s2">upfront so it was a reasonable financial</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.720" end="00:16:15.320" style="s2">risk now I&#39;ve been crazily fortunate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.830" end="00:16:17.030" style="s2">that theater tickets have also sold out</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.320" end="00:16:18.950" style="s2">so it looks like the biblical series</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.030" end="00:16:20.750" style="s2">will pay for itself with some extra left</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.950" end="00:16:22.940" style="s2">over and so you know I&#39;m pretty happy</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.750" end="00:16:24.860" style="s2">about that because that gives me some</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.940" end="00:16:26.180" style="s2">more working capital and then you might</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.860" end="00:16:28.600" style="s2">say well what am I going to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:30.740" style="s2">capital well I&#39;m going to continue doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.600" end="00:16:32.750" style="s2">the sorts of things that I&#39;m already</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.740" end="00:16:34.700" style="s2">doing I want to do a series on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.750" end="00:16:37.400" style="s2">hundred greatest books of the Western</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.700" end="00:16:39.470" style="s2">canon for example I want to move genuine</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.400" end="00:16:41.120" style="s2">humanities education out of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.470" end="00:16:43.370" style="s2">universities where it isn&#39;t being taught</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.120" end="00:16:45.740" style="s2">anyways as far as I can tell online</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.370" end="00:16:47.630" style="s2">where people can access it freely I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.740" end="00:16:49.790" style="s2">talking to a wide variety of people</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.630" end="00:16:51.590" style="s2">right now about trying to do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">more formal sense so that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.590" end="00:16:56.210" style="s2">possibility for widespread university</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:16:57.650" style="s2">education can be universally accessible</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.210" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">and one of the things we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.650" end="00:17:01.220" style="s2">crack is the problem of how to teach</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:03.020" style="s2">people to write because that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.220" end="00:17:06.500" style="s2">troublesome thing and by the way you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.020" end="00:17:08.720" style="s2">know you guys if you go onto my website</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.500" end="00:17:13.070" style="s2">Jordan Peterson comm and you go into</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.720" end="00:17:16.370" style="s2">courses and you go into psychology for</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.070" end="00:17:18.350" style="s2">30 if you look carefully there you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.370" end="00:17:19.850" style="s2">see that there&#39;s an essay rubric the tip</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.350" end="00:17:21.950" style="s2">that tells people how to write and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.850" end="00:17:23.870" style="s2">actually that&#39;s become quite popular and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.950" end="00:17:25.340" style="s2">so if you&#39;re interested in how to learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.870" end="00:17:26.570" style="s2">to write I&#39;ve written something about</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.340" end="00:17:27.890" style="s2">that already and we&#39;re going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.570" end="00:17:30.830" style="s2">piece of software that&#39;s going to help</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.890" end="00:17:33.410" style="s2">people learn to write and so I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.830" end="00:17:35.810" style="s2">plans for how to make writing education</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.410" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">broadly accessible to people so I would</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.810" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">like to make humanities education of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">highest order broadly accessible to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:43.010" style="s2">people and I also want to teach them how</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:44.840" style="s2">to write and I&#39;m going to try to crack</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.010" end="00:17:47.930" style="s2">the online university accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.840" end="00:17:49.760" style="s2">problem and so part of the money that or</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.930" end="00:17:52.970" style="s2">a substantial proportion of the money</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.760" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">that is being donated to me let&#39;s say or</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.970" end="00:17:57.410" style="s2">is being offered to me by my monthly</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:17:59.870" style="s2">supporters so that&#39;s all of you people</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.410" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">is going to be going to projects exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.870" end="00:18:04.070" style="s2">like that and the reason for that is is</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:06.680" style="s2">that what the hell else would I do with</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.070" end="00:18:08.930" style="s2">the money you know I mean to me money is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.680" end="00:18:11.510" style="s2">a tool it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.930" end="00:18:14.090" style="s2">not the means whereby you develop a</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.510" end="00:18:16.430" style="s2">luxurious lifestyle and spend your time</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.090" end="00:18:18.020" style="s2">burning yourself half to death in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.430" end="00:18:20.120" style="s2">Sun and the Caribbean snorting cocaine</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.020" end="00:18:22.670" style="s2">and chasing hookers you know it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.120" end="00:18:26.510" style="s2">that&#39;s just not in the cards for me</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.670" end="00:18:27.560" style="s2">and and so I want to devote it towards</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.510" end="00:18:29.240" style="s2">the sorts of things that have already</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.560" end="00:18:32.180" style="s2">been pursuing except on a broader scale</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.240" end="00:18:34.250" style="s2">and so you know and I think of people</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.180" end="00:18:36.140" style="s2">like Elon Musk too not that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.250" end="00:18:38.060" style="s2">comparing myself to Elon Musk but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.140" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">he has plenty of money and I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.060" end="00:18:41.930" style="s2">really somebody&#39;s got to have the damn</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:43.400" style="s2">money it might as well be people who</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.930" end="00:18:45.530" style="s2">have the kind of vision that people like</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.400" end="00:18:46.970" style="s2">he does have because maybe they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.530" end="00:18:50.420" style="s2">something good for the world I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.970" end="00:18:54.370" style="s2">hope is Giga factories produce batteries</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.420" end="00:18:56.660" style="s2">like mad so that we can start to make</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.370" end="00:18:58.580" style="s2">alternative energy sources economically</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.660" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">viable and maybe reduce our dependence</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.580" end="00:19:02.450" style="s2">on oil and maybe get ourselves out from</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:03.560" style="s2">underneath the thumb of the Saudi Arabs</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:06.770" style="s2">that would be a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.560" end="00:19:08.600" style="s2">so the monetary issue it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.770" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">interesting it&#39;s like it is not that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.600" end="00:19:12.260" style="s2">have the money it&#39;s what you do with it</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:14.210" style="s2">so anyways those are some of my plans</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.260" end="00:19:15.950" style="s2">and that isn&#39;t all of them because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">going to come up with a bunch more plans</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.950" end="00:19:20.870" style="s2">and I&#39;m going to try to implement them</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:23.060" style="s2">as rapidly as I possibly can I&#39;ve put my</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.870" end="00:19:24.500" style="s2">clinical practice on hiatus for the next</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.060" end="00:19:26.630" style="s2">three months so that I have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.500" end="00:19:28.760" style="s2">think and I&#39;ve requested that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.630" end="00:19:30.380" style="s2">University advance my sabbatical by one</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.760" end="00:19:32.630" style="s2">year so I should have about a year to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.380" end="00:19:35.210" style="s2">think about what I should be doing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.630" end="00:19:37.340" style="s2">YouTube and how I can be promoting</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.210" end="00:19:39.200" style="s2">broad-scale public education of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.340" end="00:19:41.420" style="s2">highest quality and that&#39;s a really fun</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.200" end="00:19:43.490" style="s2">problem to solve and the fact that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.420" end="00:19:45.470" style="s2">being supported by all of you people on</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.490" end="00:19:47.630" style="s2">patreon makes the probability that avail</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.470" end="00:19:52.610" style="s2">to that I&#39;ll be able to devote my time</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.630" end="00:19:53.750" style="s2">to that much higher so so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.610" end="00:19:55.580" style="s2">I&#39;m going to do with it I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.750" end="00:19:58.760" style="s2">the best things I can possibly think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.580" end="00:20:03.130" style="s2">to do with it and hopefully that&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.760" end="00:20:06.350" style="s2">and so far it seems to be going well so</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.130" end="00:20:07.820" style="s2">yeah I mean I&#39;ve been taken aback quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.350" end="00:20:09.740" style="s2">a bit by the I mean it&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.820" end="00:20:11.360" style="s2">that you know the people who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.740" end="00:20:13.610" style="s2">trying to take me down let&#39;s say or</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.360" end="00:20:16.070" style="s2">squawking and bitching because I happen</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.610" end="00:20:18.170" style="s2">to be generating a fairly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.070" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">income from this although I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.170" end="00:20:20.519" style="s2">about it as an income as I already said</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:23.219" style="s2">I think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.519" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">as a toolkit for pursuing more</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.219" end="00:20:27.479" style="s2">interesting things it&#39;s like if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:29.580" style="s2">the best they can do with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.479" end="00:20:31.559" style="s2">continuing to tarnish my name well then</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.580" end="00:20:35.190" style="s2">let them let them go right ahead about</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.559" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">that and I think the proof is in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.190" end="00:20:39.179" style="s2">outcome and like the biblical series and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:40.830" style="s2">that&#39;s a direct consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.179" end="00:20:43.589" style="s2">patreon support that seems to be going</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.830" end="00:20:45.119" style="s2">like mad I think you know about 500,000</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.589" end="00:20:47.940" style="s2">people have watched the video so far</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.119" end="00:20:49.649" style="s2">with another who knows tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.940" end="00:20:51.570" style="s2">of people listening to the podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.649" end="00:20:53.549" style="s2">that&#39;s just a bloody miracle that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.570" end="00:20:57.029" style="s2">many people would be interested in what</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.549" end="00:20:59.219" style="s2">I consider the fundamental foundation</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.029" end="00:21:00.959" style="s2">for any true humanities education so</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.219" end="00:21:03.029" style="s2">great we&#39;ll build from there and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.959" end="00:21:06.209" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.029" end="00:21:08.219" style="s2">the money so and if people don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.209" end="00:21:10.229" style="s2">that then they don&#39;t have to donate or</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.219" end="00:21:13.379" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to subscribe it&#39;s hardly</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.229" end="00:21:16.169" style="s2">like it&#39;s mandatory so anyways I&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.379" end="00:21:19.909" style="s2">with that and I&#39;ll get to Tom another</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.169" end="00:21:23.039" style="s2">question or a question another question</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.909" end="00:21:25.409" style="s2">um here&#39;s one that got two hundred and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.039" end="00:21:27.649" style="s2">sixty four votes so far is the belief in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.409" end="00:21:29.940" style="s2">something more than experienced reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.649" end="00:21:32.129" style="s2">unreasonable okay so I want to address</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.940" end="00:21:33.299" style="s2">that question technically to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.129" end="00:21:34.499" style="s2">begin with because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.299" end="00:21:36.179" style="s2">that you want to do when someone asks</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.499" end="00:21:37.859" style="s2">you a question is that you want to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.179" end="00:21:39.779" style="s2">a look at the question because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.859" end="00:21:41.489" style="s2">question boxes you in in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.779" end="00:21:43.109" style="s2">and if you&#39;re going to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.489" end="00:21:45.389" style="s2">question you make you have to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.109" end="00:21:47.129" style="s2">that you&#39;ve properly processed the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.389" end="00:21:49.349" style="s2">structure of the question so let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.129" end="00:21:50.599" style="s2">at this one is the belief in something</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.349" end="00:21:53.399" style="s2">more than experienced reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.599" end="00:21:55.559" style="s2">unreasonable and so then I&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.399" end="00:21:58.829" style="s2">Socratic on this and say well it depends</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.559" end="00:22:02.009" style="s2">on what you mean by belief experienced</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.829" end="00:22:05.159" style="s2">reality something more and unreasonable</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.009" end="00:22:06.509" style="s2">and and this see the problem is you</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.159" end="00:22:09.239" style="s2">can&#39;t really answer a question like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.509" end="00:22:12.179" style="s2">unless you delve into the definitions so</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.239" end="00:22:14.159" style="s2">let&#39;s say well what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.179" end="00:22:17.070" style="s2">experienced reality do you mean that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.159" end="00:22:18.899" style="s2">which is directly Grip abide isense --is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.070" end="00:22:21.719" style="s2">well then I would say well do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.899" end="00:22:24.359" style="s2">believe in numbers because numbers</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.719" end="00:22:26.969" style="s2">aren&#39;t directly experienceable but</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.359" end="00:22:30.179" style="s2">obviously they&#39;re real if you define</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.969" end="00:22:32.429" style="s2">reality as the use of concepts that give</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.179" end="00:22:34.169" style="s2">you grip and power in the world and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.429" end="00:22:35.580" style="s2">think because I&#39;m a pragmatist</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.169" end="00:22:38.009" style="s2">I mean part of the way that I define</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.580" end="00:22:40.889" style="s2">something as real is whether or not it</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.009" end="00:22:43.379" style="s2">has functional operative status in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.889" end="00:22:44.940" style="s2">world and so the belief in something</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.379" end="00:22:47.460" style="s2">more than experience reality is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.940" end="00:22:49.499" style="s2">obviously clearly reasonable if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.460" end="00:22:51.629" style="s2">regard abstractions as something more</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.499" end="00:22:53.220" style="s2">than experienced reality and that brings</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.629" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">up another issue and the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.220" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">whether or not abstractions are even</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">more real than experienced reality and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:00.690" style="s2">would say often they are because</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:03.119" style="s2">otherwise abstraction wouldn&#39;t work so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.690" end="00:23:06.749" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely not unreasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.119" end="00:23:09.450" style="s2">then you do you mean merely subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.749" end="00:23:11.279" style="s2">experience reality or do you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.450" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">kind of reality that can be experienced</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.279" end="00:23:14.940" style="s2">by multiple people at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.710" style="s2">because that&#39;s also different that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.940" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">latter is more in the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.710" end="00:23:22.230" style="s2">scientific inquiry and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:24.570" style="s2">problem with belief in subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.230" end="00:23:26.489" style="s2">experienced reality is not so much that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.570" end="00:23:28.379" style="s2">what you experience subjectively isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.489" end="00:23:32.100" style="s2">real is that you can get the categories</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.379" end="00:23:33.749" style="s2">wrong you know dreams are real but</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.100" end="00:23:35.820" style="s2">they&#39;re not the same kind of real as</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.749" end="00:23:39.119" style="s2">things in the outside world that other</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.820" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">people can experience and to conflate</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.119" end="00:23:42.869" style="s2">the tort of failure failed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:44.730" style="s2">distinguish between them is a form of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.869" end="00:23:48.809" style="s2">insanity but that doesn&#39;t mean that both</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.730" end="00:23:51.210" style="s2">of them aren&#39;t real so so the simple</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.809" end="00:23:52.769" style="s2">answer to the question is the belief is</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:54.869" style="s2">the belief in something more than</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.769" end="00:23:58.169" style="s2">experienced reality unreasonable is no</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.869" end="00:24:00.210" style="s2">but it depends on it depends on your</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.169" end="00:24:02.299" style="s2">specific definitions of all those terms</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.210" end="00:24:06.119" style="s2">and those sorts of things really matter</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.299" end="00:24:07.799" style="s2">okay bet Bob Asbury says I&#39;m a 58 year</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.119" end="00:24:11.580" style="s2">old American redneck who never went to</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.799" end="00:24:13.049" style="s2">college a day in his life but I feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.580" end="00:24:15.480" style="s2">like I&#39;m getting a world-class education</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.049" end="00:24:17.639" style="s2">every day thank you dr. Petersen</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.480" end="00:24:19.649" style="s2">you are very cool well thank you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.639" end="00:24:21.929" style="s2">know how cool I am exactly but I am I</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.649" end="00:24:26.730" style="s2">tell you man and this is the dead truth</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.929" end="00:24:29.940" style="s2">I am absolutely thrilled that I have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.730" end="00:24:31.649" style="s2">opportunity to provide educational</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.940" end="00:24:34.859" style="s2">resources to people all over the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.649" end="00:24:37.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a dream you know really I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.859" end="00:24:39.389" style="s2">an absolute privilege so when I get</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.230" end="00:24:41.129" style="s2">letters from people like you very very</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.389" end="00:24:43.320" style="s2">frequently from all over the world you</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.129" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">know when the fact that now we have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.320" end="00:24:48.330" style="s2">technology to allow people in principle</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:50.580" style="s2">to have a world class universe</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.330" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">the education is mind-boggling and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.580" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">here&#39;s something I think is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:55.470" style="s2">comical and I&#39;ve been pursuing this with</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">a group of people that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.470" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">discussing I&#39;ve been having intense</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.100" style="s2">discussions with some in Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:05.789" style="s2">and some in Montreal in some in Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.100" end="00:25:08.429" style="s2">you know here&#39;s the university situation</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.789" end="00:25:10.200" style="s2">in many ways number one they&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.429" end="00:25:12.929" style="s2">students in debt in a tremendous way in</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.200" end="00:25:15.210" style="s2">the United States over because of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.929" end="00:25:18.779" style="s2">overpriced education they don&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.210" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">students um declare bankruptcy because</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.779" end="00:25:25.110" style="s2">of the debt and so it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:27.049" style="s2">indentured servitude and so then</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.110" end="00:25:29.789" style="s2">students come out of university and</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.049" end="00:25:32.039" style="s2">death--it heavily at the time of their</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.789" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">life when they should be relatively free</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.039" end="00:25:37.500" style="s2">of financial burdens so that they can be</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">creative and entrepreneurial because</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.500" end="00:25:40.740" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:42.929" style="s2">young generally speaking then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.740" end="00:25:46.230" style="s2">universities have become administrative</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.929" end="00:25:47.909" style="s2">Lea top-heavy and stultified because of</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.230" end="00:25:50.279" style="s2">that then they&#39;ve abandoned their</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.909" end="00:25:52.380" style="s2">commitment to the humanities right then</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.279" end="00:25:54.210" style="s2">they&#39;re not utilizing modern technology</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.380" end="00:25:57.809" style="s2">to extend the reach as broadly as they</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.210" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">possibly could then they&#39;ve they in some</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.809" end="00:26:02.549" style="s2">sense abandoned their responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:04.139" style="s2">do accrediting properly and devalued the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.549" end="00:26:05.370" style="s2">value of the degree because they treat</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.139" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">their students like consumers</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.370" end="00:26:11.309" style="s2">and-and-and inflate the grade currency</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:13.500" style="s2">so to me that&#39;s a perfect storm of error</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.309" end="00:26:15.389" style="s2">and so I see an opportunity emerging</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.500" end="00:26:17.250" style="s2">right now where the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.389" end="00:26:19.049" style="s2">property that&#39;s related to the true</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.250" end="00:26:21.029" style="s2">humanities and that would be at least in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.049" end="00:26:23.130" style="s2">part the Western cultural Canon could</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.029" end="00:26:25.080" style="s2">just be taken out of the University&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.130" end="00:26:28.110" style="s2">grip and provided to people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.080" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">high-quality form online and if I can</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.110" end="00:26:31.080" style="s2">crack how to teach people to write and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:32.460" style="s2">then also to figure out the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.080" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">accreditation problem which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.460" end="00:26:38.100" style="s2">think is a it&#39;s not an overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:40.110" style="s2">complex problem it&#39;s complex but not</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.100" end="00:26:42.029" style="s2">overwhelmingly then there&#39;s no reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.110" end="00:26:44.970" style="s2">that the university can&#39;t moved to can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.029" end="00:26:46.679" style="s2">move online and I would say the true</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.970" end="00:26:48.570" style="s2">University exists where people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.679" end="00:26:50.669" style="s2">pursuing education because they bloody</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.570" end="00:26:52.649" style="s2">well want to get educated because they</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.669" end="00:26:54.419" style="s2">know that being sharp and articulate and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.649" end="00:26:56.190" style="s2">historically informed and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.419" end="00:26:58.529" style="s2">philosophically wise and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.190" end="00:26:59.940" style="s2">makes their lives better makes them</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.529" end="00:27:02.050" style="s2">better citizens makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.940" end="00:27:03.820" style="s2">responsible and so I want to follow</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.050" end="00:27:05.200" style="s2">University where it goes and as far as</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.820" end="00:27:07.300" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned the university is where</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.200" end="00:27:09.730" style="s2">people want to listen to wisdom and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.300" end="00:27:11.260" style="s2">going to try to dispense wisdom to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.730" end="00:27:14.560" style="s2">degree that I&#39;m fortunate enough to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.260" end="00:27:16.450" style="s2">access to it so anyways Bob like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.560" end="00:27:19.150" style="s2">thrilled that I can be of service to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.450" end="00:27:22.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s a real privilege and so and</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.150" end="00:27:23.950" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do more of that so all</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.060" end="00:27:24.730" style="s2">right so another question am I feeling</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.950" end="00:27:27.850" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.730" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">how is my health well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.850" end="00:27:33.790" style="s2">question I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve had a history of</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:36.130" style="s2">depression as some of you may know and</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.440" end="00:28:36.820" style="s2">so my health is good I&#39;ve lost about 50</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.620" end="00:28:38.800" style="s2">pounds because I&#39;ve stopped eating</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:40.900" style="s2">carbohydrates almost completely and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.800" end="00:28:43.450" style="s2">that&#39;s bloody unbelievable I&#39;m back down</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.900" end="00:28:45.460" style="s2">to the weight I was when I was 30 and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.450" end="00:28:46.840" style="s2">think that I&#39;m going to get on top of my</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.460" end="00:28:48.580" style="s2">health problems and my daughter who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.840" end="00:28:51.940" style="s2">had extraordinarily serious health</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.580" end="00:28:53.590" style="s2">problems including - hip hip replacement</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.940" end="00:28:56.500" style="s2">when she was 16 and an ankle replacement</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.590" end="00:28:58.360" style="s2">- when she was also 16 she walked around</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.500" end="00:29:00.760" style="s2">on two broken legs for a whole year in</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.360" end="00:29:03.070" style="s2">excruciating agony like she&#39;s figured a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.760" end="00:29:05.350" style="s2">lot of this out and she&#39;s off her ante</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.070" end="00:29:07.360" style="s2">or her immune suppressant medication and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.350" end="00:29:09.580" style="s2">all sorts of other things so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.360" end="00:29:11.500" style="s2">painstaking process and I&#39;ve been eating</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.580" end="00:29:13.410" style="s2">nothing literally nothing but beef</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.500" end="00:29:15.549" style="s2">chicken and salad for a whole month</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.410" end="00:29:17.799" style="s2">trying to figure out where my</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.549" end="00:29:19.389" style="s2">dietary sensitivities are but so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.799" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">that&#39;s a long answer to your question</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.389" end="00:29:23.769" style="s2">but I&#39;m feeling pretty damn good and if</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.309" end="00:29:25.389" style="s2">I can got a few more administrative</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.769" end="00:29:27.249" style="s2">matters that are chasing me around but I</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.389" end="00:29:29.499" style="s2">think I can get on top of them and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.249" end="00:29:31.960" style="s2">man I&#39;m going to be back at it and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.499" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be real fun so okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.960" end="00:29:36.940" style="s2">let&#39;s see what else we got for live</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:38.860" style="s2">questions here what would I say the male</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.940" end="00:29:41.080" style="s2">to female ratio is in my classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.860" end="00:29:43.720" style="s2">currently oh yeah there&#39;s no man man</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.080" end="00:29:46.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like 80% women in my psychology</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.720" end="00:29:48.519" style="s2">classes and in 10 years there won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.119" end="00:29:50.289" style="s2">man left in the humanities unless they</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.519" end="00:29:52.509" style="s2">go online in which case maybe it&#39;ll only</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.289" end="00:29:54.460" style="s2">be men because huh you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.509" end="00:29:57.279" style="s2">think so but most of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.460" end="00:30:01.269" style="s2">watching my videos are men it&#39;s about 90</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.279" end="00:30:03.279" style="s2">91 percent actually so yeah the men are</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.269" end="00:30:04.779" style="s2">bailing out of the university like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.279" end="00:30:08.649" style="s2">just unbelievable and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.779" end="00:30:10.690" style="s2">happening for about 30 years so um it</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.649" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">might if things don&#39;t change and if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.690" end="00:30:18.100" style="s2">present linear trends continue then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.059" end="00:30:21.159" style="s2">it&#39;ll be all women by by 2025 and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.100" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">really not good not that it&#39;s good not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.159" end="00:30:24.940" style="s2">good because there&#39;s so many women it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:26.889" style="s2">not good because there aren&#39;t any men</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.940" end="00:30:28.059" style="s2">and obviously that&#39;s not good for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.889" end="00:30:30.100" style="s2">women either because I don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.059" end="00:30:32.470" style="s2">they&#39;re going to find their man so all</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.100" end="00:30:34.570" style="s2">right what are your thoughts on the book</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.470" end="00:30:36.309" style="s2">of Revelation in the Bible it freaked me</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.570" end="00:30:38.049" style="s2">out when I was a kid yeah well I should</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.309" end="00:30:39.759" style="s2">say so man if you&#39;re an adult and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.049" end="00:30:42.309" style="s2">read it it should freak you out what are</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.759" end="00:30:45.999" style="s2">my thoughts on it I think it&#39;s a I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.309" end="00:30:51.309" style="s2">it&#39;s the account of a hallucinogenic</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.999" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">trip probably probably what would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.309" end="00:30:57.309" style="s2">call caused by psilocybin mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">maybe maybe Amanita muscaria which were</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.309" end="00:31:03.190" style="s2">was identified by a guy named Wausau</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:06.519" style="s2">about 25-30 years ago maybe even more as</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.190" end="00:31:08.200" style="s2">the soma of the ancient Hindus so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.519" end="00:31:09.429" style="s2">think it&#39;s a hallucinating it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.200" end="00:31:12.190" style="s2">account of an extremely profound</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.429" end="00:31:15.399" style="s2">hallucinogenic trip that that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.190" end="00:31:17.440" style="s2">think I mean what it means that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.399" end="00:31:20.409" style="s2">whole different issue and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.440" end="00:31:22.269" style="s2">try to address that when and if I get to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.409" end="00:31:24.220" style="s2">the Book of Revelations in my biblical</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.269" end="00:31:25.659" style="s2">series but that&#39;s going to be probably a</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.220" end="00:31:27.669" style="s2">couple of years in the future at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.659" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">rate I&#39;m going because it&#39;s taken me</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.669" end="00:31:33.669" style="s2">three weeks to get through Genesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:35.889" style="s2">one so alright violet Irwin says I look</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.669" end="00:31:37.990" style="s2">great well violet your avatar looks</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.889" end="00:31:39.850" style="s2">great too and well thank you part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.990" end="00:31:41.980" style="s2">reason I look great I think to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.850" end="00:31:43.570" style="s2">degree that I do is that I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.980" end="00:31:45.370" style="s2">good camera that my son helped me</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.570" end="00:31:46.899" style="s2">purchase and so it makes me look a hell</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.370" end="00:31:49.090" style="s2">of a lot better than I actually do look</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.899" end="00:31:52.299" style="s2">so anyways I appreciate the sentiment</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.090" end="00:31:54.190" style="s2">alright do I see any downside to a child</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.299" end="00:31:55.750" style="s2">being raised by its father in the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.190" end="00:31:56.440" style="s2">three years while the mother is working</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.750" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">full-time</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.440" end="00:32:01.720" style="s2">are there psychological consequences for</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:03.970" style="s2">the child to be expected I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.720" end="00:32:07.740" style="s2">depends very much on the individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.970" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">situation in the family I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.740" end="00:32:15.700" style="s2">convinced that the art of infant care is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:17.679" style="s2">something that a tremendous number of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.700" end="00:32:19.419" style="s2">males are highly specialized for I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.679" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">you have to have a feminine temperament</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.419" end="00:32:23.470" style="s2">and that would mean to do it to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.659" style="s2">infant care properly and that would mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.470" end="00:32:27.970" style="s2">that you have to be at least very</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.659" end="00:32:29.980" style="s2">agreeable and maybe you&#39;ll also be have</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.970" end="00:32:31.870" style="s2">to be relatively high in neuroticism so</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.980" end="00:32:34.480" style="s2">that you respond rapidly enough to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.870" end="00:32:38.620" style="s2">distress crisis of the child and I also</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.480" end="00:32:40.630" style="s2">think that in order to bond the way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.620" end="00:32:42.460" style="s2">you have to bond when you&#39;re a mother</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.630" end="00:32:44.139" style="s2">who&#39;s taking care of an infant let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.460" end="00:32:45.789" style="s2">under nine months I think some of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.139" end="00:32:48.309" style="s2">biochemical transformations that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.789" end="00:32:52.019" style="s2">accompany pregnancy childbirth and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.309" end="00:32:54.370" style="s2">lactation probably set up the proper</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.019" end="00:32:56.380" style="s2">biochemical underlying biochemical and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.370" end="00:33:00.539" style="s2">psychological milieu that makes the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.380" end="00:33:02.980" style="s2">of bonding that that increases the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.539" end="00:33:04.570" style="s2">probability of high level care possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.980" end="00:33:05.740" style="s2">in those few months that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.570" end="00:33:07.240" style="s2">that men can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.740" end="00:33:11.429" style="s2">but I would also say in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.240" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of hard on men you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.429" end="00:33:15.399" style="s2">it&#39;s a complicated issue but like one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.260" style="s2">the things I experienced and I really</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.399" end="00:33:19.059" style="s2">like kids you know like I love kids</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.260" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">and they generally respond really well</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.059" end="00:33:24.880" style="s2">to me babies they&#39;re a different matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:29.049" style="s2">because I&#39;m I don&#39;t really feel fully</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.880" end="00:33:31.000" style="s2">qualified to give a baby what it needs</p>

<p begin="00:33:41.880" end="00:33:46.710" style="s2">um so I think that there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.030" end="00:33:48.390" style="s2">circumstances under which that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.710" end="00:33:50.070" style="s2">thing to do and actually I had a</p>

<p begin="00:34:38.460" end="00:34:43.139" style="s2">and my wife is actually a pretty tough</p>

<p begin="00:34:59.580" end="00:35:03.570" style="s2">that the biochemical transformations</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:05.340" style="s2">that accompany pregnancy and so forth do</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.570" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">facilitate that I&#39;ve also seen that with</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.340" end="00:35:11.340" style="s2">my sister who is quite a masculine woman</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:14.220" style="s2">and very adventurous man she she</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.340" end="00:35:16.740" style="s2">smuggled Mercedes trucks across the</p>

<p begin="00:35:27.150" end="00:35:31.470" style="s2">like she is she&#39;s a very adventurous</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.340" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">person and she took a lot after my</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:39.420" style="s2">know she had kids when she was 40</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.110" end="00:35:41.130" style="s2">luckily for her and man she turned into</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.420" end="00:35:43.170" style="s2">my mother overnight and I really like my</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.130" end="00:35:45.180" style="s2">mother you know like that&#39;s no insult</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">believe me she&#39;s a really great person</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.180" end="00:35:50.220" style="s2">very very caring very kind probably to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">her own detriment but to see my sister</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.220" end="00:35:55.380" style="s2">transform into this tough masculine</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">person who I respected a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.380" end="00:36:01.320" style="s2">for exactly those virtues into into mom</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:02.820" style="s2">was really quite remarkable and to think</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.320" end="00:36:05.610" style="s2">that there&#39;s nothing biochemical about</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.820" end="00:36:08.940" style="s2">that is really I think quite naive and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.610" end="00:36:10.770" style="s2">and you know and and pointless because</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.940" end="00:36:13.680" style="s2">of course there&#39;s something biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.770" end="00:36:15.450" style="s2">about about birth and child care for</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.680" end="00:36:18.000" style="s2">God&#39;s sake has been going on for like</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.450" end="00:36:22.080" style="s2">ever since sexual dimorphism emerged on</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.000" end="00:36:24.360" style="s2">the evolutionary landscape so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.080" end="00:36:25.950" style="s2">that do you think that boys in our</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.360" end="00:36:27.870" style="s2">society are in need of a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.950" end="00:36:34.530" style="s2">transition to manhood like a modern day</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.870" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">initiation ritual a product doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.530" end="00:36:38.100" style="s2">matter whether they&#39;re in need of it</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:39.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to get it because you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.100" end="00:36:42.300" style="s2">can&#39;t really just invent something like</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.720" end="00:36:44.250" style="s2">that right it has to be it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.300" end="00:36:46.890" style="s2">that evolves over a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.250" end="00:36:48.450" style="s2">time I do think that what they need I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.890" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">really observed this interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.450" end="00:36:53.130" style="s2">enough in the response that young men</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">have had to my public talks and probably</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.130" end="00:36:57.750" style="s2">on YouTube as well with regards to what</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:36:59.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve been saying because you know young</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.750" end="00:37:02.730" style="s2">people have been fed this pablum since</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.970" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">the 1960s that the pathway to happiness</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.730" end="00:37:06.810" style="s2">and freedom in life first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:08.010" style="s2">those are the things that you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.810" end="00:37:09.780" style="s2">supposed to be after especially</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.010" end="00:37:13.170" style="s2">happiness and that they&#39;re to be found</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.780" end="00:37:15.750" style="s2">in in like rites and untrammeled freedom</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.170" end="00:37:17.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s complete that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.750" end="00:37:19.710" style="s2">one-sided because for every right there</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.760" end="00:37:22.110" style="s2">is a corresponding responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.710" end="00:37:23.130" style="s2">freedom can be chaos just as much as it</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.110" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.130" end="00:37:28.320" style="s2">you know blissful lack of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:30.120" style="s2">and the ability to make hedonic choices</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.320" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">one after another and I&#39;ve been speaking</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.120" end="00:37:34.170" style="s2">to young men in particular and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:37.500" style="s2">the ones who keep coming to my talks by</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.170" end="00:37:39.060" style="s2">the way about truth in action and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.500" end="00:37:40.980" style="s2">responsibilities and like they&#39;re eating</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.060" end="00:37:43.650" style="s2">that up it&#39;s there I can see their eyes</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.980" end="00:37:45.240" style="s2">light up which is so cool I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.650" end="00:37:48.060" style="s2">talking to the people who ran for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.240" end="00:37:50.430" style="s2">conservative leadership in Canada about</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.060" end="00:37:52.290" style="s2">the fact that when I go talk to male</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.430" end="00:37:55.140" style="s2">audiences especially young men that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.290" end="00:37:57.360" style="s2">they&#39;re unbelievably enthralled by any</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.140" end="00:37:58.890" style="s2">discussion of genuine responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.360" end="00:38:00.540" style="s2">truth and so the Conservatives have</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.890" end="00:38:03.060" style="s2">something to offer young man and I would</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.540" end="00:38:05.220" style="s2">say that&#39;s roughly akin to an initiation</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.060" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">you know the idea is that at some point</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.220" end="00:38:10.010" style="s2">you have to tell young men</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:12.289" style="s2">look grow the hell up take on some</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.010" end="00:38:14.990" style="s2">responsibility straighten yourself out</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.289" end="00:38:16.970" style="s2">act honestly make yourself into an</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.990" end="00:38:19.700" style="s2">admirable and powerful character not</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.970" end="00:38:22.460" style="s2">because you&#39;re domesticated like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.700" end="00:38:25.069" style="s2">bloody puppy or a sheep but because</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.460" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to genuine Authority and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.069" end="00:38:29.569" style="s2">influence and and the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:31.220" style="s2">great good in the world and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.569" end="00:38:35.109" style="s2">an exciting call to adventure and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.220" end="00:38:37.369" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a modern sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.109" end="00:38:40.250" style="s2">intellectual equivalent to something</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.369" end="00:38:42.770" style="s2">like an initiation ritual and so I hope</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.250" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">to be like promoting that message more</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.770" end="00:38:48.079" style="s2">and more I was speaking to member of one</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.210" style="s2">of the leaders of the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.079" end="00:38:52.609" style="s2">communities in Canada today about maybe</p>

<p begin="00:38:54.260" end="00:38:57.770" style="s2">authoring program I&#39;ve talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.700" end="00:38:59.960" style="s2">a bit before on patreon you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.770" end="00:39:02.839" style="s2">program at self authoring calm that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.960" end="00:39:06.799" style="s2">enables people to generate a vision for</p>

<p begin="00:39:06.799" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">out that vision and make a plan of it I</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.510" end="00:39:11.779" style="s2">think most of you patreon subscribers</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:14.480" style="s2">have got links to that already and</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.779" end="00:39:17.150" style="s2">usernames and passwords and has a really</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.480" end="00:39:19.039" style="s2">remarkably positive effect on young men</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.150" end="00:39:21.829" style="s2">who are disenfranchised who tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.039" end="00:39:23.329" style="s2">ethnic minorities and so initiating them</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.829" end="00:39:24.950" style="s2">into the idea that they need to take</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.329" end="00:39:26.930" style="s2">control of their own destiny and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.950" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">that&#39;s the proper pathway to authority</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.930" end="00:39:30.920" style="s2">and stature and and not self esteem but</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.079" style="s2">self-respect which is a completely</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.920" end="00:39:35.890" style="s2">different thing I think is a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.079" end="00:39:38.299" style="s2">modern equivalent to initiation ritual</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.890" end="00:39:41.140" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s take another live question</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.430" end="00:39:50.210" style="s2">cleaning my disaster of a room well I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.589" end="00:39:52.490" style="s2">got something terrible to admit people</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.210" end="00:39:54.470" style="s2">because at the moment I&#39;m sitting in my</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.490" end="00:39:56.359" style="s2">room and it isn&#39;t clean at the back</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.470" end="00:39:58.730" style="s2">behind here where you can see is clean</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.359" end="00:40:00.890" style="s2">but because the events of the last seven</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.730" end="00:40:02.119" style="s2">months have been so overwhelming I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.890" end="00:40:04.039" style="s2">say that there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.119" end="00:40:06.770" style="s2">chaos that has invaded my immediate</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.039" end="00:40:09.020" style="s2">environment but I have plans to get this</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.770" end="00:40:11.150" style="s2">place sorted out in a serious way over</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.020" end="00:40:12.799" style="s2">the next few months from talk from</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.150" end="00:40:15.440" style="s2">bottom of the house to the top so</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.799" end="00:40:17.029" style="s2">halfway Brendon that&#39;s a good deal and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.440" end="00:40:20.210" style="s2">there&#39;s real psychological consequences</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.029" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">to that you know because the if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.210" end="00:40:22.470" style="s2">interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.299" style="s2">everyone here&#39;s a really sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.470" end="00:40:27.630" style="s2">book you could read you could take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.299" end="00:40:30.240" style="s2">look at Carl use last book which was</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.630" end="00:40:34.140" style="s2">called mysterium conjunction Asst so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.240" end="00:40:35.519" style="s2">that it&#39;s Latin now the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.140" end="00:40:37.380" style="s2">that book is really kind of like of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.519" end="00:40:38.819" style="s2">dictionary of symbolism he wrote it I</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.380" end="00:40:40.740" style="s2">think in his 80s and I think he was</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.819" end="00:40:42.539" style="s2">trying to get down as much as he could</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.740" end="00:40:44.130" style="s2">of what he knew as fast as he could so</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.539" end="00:40:45.660" style="s2">the first part is a dictionary of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.130" end="00:40:47.069" style="s2">symbolism and it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.660" end="00:40:49.200" style="s2">read unless you&#39;ve read a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.069" end="00:40:50.759" style="s2">other writing but the second part of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.200" end="00:40:52.859" style="s2">book which I think is an absolute work</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.759" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">of genius Jung makes a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.859" end="00:40:56.249" style="s2">propositions about higher order moral</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:58.230" style="s2">development and so I&#39;m going to run</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.249" end="00:40:59.670" style="s2">through them really quickly and describe</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.230" end="00:41:01.380" style="s2">their symbolism so he said the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.670" end="00:41:03.809" style="s2">thing that you want to do if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.380" end="00:41:06.269" style="s2">going to get your act together and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.809" end="00:41:08.940" style="s2">is like an extension of the of the pH</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.269" end="00:41:11.220" style="s2">Elliott notion of stages and moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.940" end="00:41:15.150" style="s2">development he said you know you have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.220" end="00:41:16.410" style="s2">intellect and you have a set of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.150" end="00:41:18.809" style="s2">and motivations and you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.410" end="00:41:20.460" style="s2">conceptualize the intellect symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.809" end="00:41:22.349" style="s2">as masculine and the emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.460" end="00:41:25.349" style="s2">motivations symbolically as feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.349" end="00:41:26.999" style="s2">so the first conjunction which is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.349" end="00:41:28.829" style="s2">bringing together of the masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.999" end="00:41:30.779" style="s2">feminine to make a complete being would</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.829" end="00:41:33.269" style="s2">be the union of the intellect with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.779" end="00:41:35.910" style="s2">emotions and motivations so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.269" end="00:41:38.369" style="s2">not fighting your deeper motivations</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.910" end="00:41:40.769" style="s2">with your thought you know that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.369" end="00:41:42.509" style="s2">all moving in the same direction and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.769" end="00:41:45.390" style="s2">that would be conjunction number one and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.509" end="00:41:47.819" style="s2">so then that makes you United in terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.390" end="00:41:49.739" style="s2">of your capability for subjective</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.819" end="00:41:50.759" style="s2">experience you&#39;re all pointing in all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.739" end="00:41:52.769" style="s2">that&#39;s pointing in the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.759" end="00:41:54.269" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the things that can make</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.769" end="00:41:56.460" style="s2">you unstoppable because you&#39;re not at</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.269" end="00:41:57.989" style="s2">war with yourself that and so the next</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.460" end="00:42:00.900" style="s2">conjunction as far as he was concerned</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.989" end="00:42:03.619" style="s2">was also expressed symbolically so now</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.900" end="00:42:06.619" style="s2">you have the masculine union of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.619" end="00:42:08.940" style="s2">intellect emotion and motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.619" end="00:42:10.859" style="s2">then you have the body which you can now</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.940" end="00:42:12.720" style="s2">conceptualize this feminine so then you</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.859" end="00:42:15.299" style="s2">bring those together in a creative union</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.720" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">and so that means that you start to act</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.299" end="00:42:20.700" style="s2">out what you think and feel so that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:24.299" style="s2">there&#39;s no paradoxical relationship or</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.700" end="00:42:26.489" style="s2">or enacted lie they call that a</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.299" end="00:42:28.739" style="s2">performative contradiction between what</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.489" end="00:42:30.950" style="s2">you think and feel and what you do and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.739" end="00:42:33.690" style="s2">that&#39;s and so because part of being</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.950" end="00:42:34.410" style="s2">honest is that you act out what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.690" end="00:42:36.690" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.410" end="00:42:38.630" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s great so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.690" end="00:42:41.610" style="s2">next conjunction and so that makes you</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.630" end="00:42:44.550" style="s2">integrated in mind and emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.610" end="00:42:47.520" style="s2">motivation and in enacted enacted</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.550" end="00:42:49.080" style="s2">routine and body great so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.520" end="00:42:51.840" style="s2">way of bringing yourself together</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.080" end="00:42:53.220" style="s2">but the third conjunction is the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.840" end="00:42:54.480" style="s2">that&#39;s most interesting and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.220" end="00:42:56.820" style="s2">the one that&#39;s most difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.480" end="00:42:59.940" style="s2">understand and that conjunction occurs</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.820" end="00:43:02.820" style="s2">when you take this unified mind-body</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.940" end="00:43:04.500" style="s2">continuum let&#39;s say and you think oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.820" end="00:43:07.170" style="s2">wait a second there&#39;s an there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.500" end="00:43:09.570" style="s2">element of that missing and that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.170" end="00:43:11.820" style="s2">experience my experience of the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.570" end="00:43:13.590" style="s2">that&#39;s hypothetically outside of me or</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.820" end="00:43:16.590" style="s2">that&#39;s hypothetically not me</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.590" end="00:43:20.820" style="s2">now you know the your experience of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.590" end="00:43:23.070" style="s2">world outside that&#39;s not you is a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.820" end="00:43:26.100" style="s2">strange experience because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.070" end="00:43:31.230" style="s2">self-evident for example to me that my</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.100" end="00:43:34.620" style="s2">wife is not me we spend so much time</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.230" end="00:43:37.410" style="s2">together she&#39;s in my experience so much</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.620" end="00:43:39.270" style="s2">we have a joint past and a present and a</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.410" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">joint future the same with my kids and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.270" end="00:43:43.170" style="s2">the people who are close to me it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:46.140" style="s2">obvious to me that my wife is less</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.170" end="00:43:48.630" style="s2">valuable to me than I am to me she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.140" end="00:43:51.090" style="s2">certainly more valuable to me than some</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.630" end="00:43:53.400" style="s2">arbitrary body part like an arm or a leg</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.090" end="00:43:57.150" style="s2">you know and people are perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.400" end="00:43:59.400" style="s2">capable of making gestures of physical</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.150" end="00:44:02.820" style="s2">self-sacrifice in order to rescue people</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.400" end="00:44:04.710" style="s2">that they love and so just exactly who</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.820" end="00:44:06.780" style="s2">you are and just exactly who the</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.710" end="00:44:09.420" style="s2">external world is not clear at all and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.780" end="00:44:11.250" style="s2">so the last conjunction for Jung was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.420" end="00:44:13.950" style="s2">eradication of the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.250" end="00:44:17.100" style="s2">your subjective experience as you and</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.950" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">your objective experience as you which</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.100" end="00:44:22.260" style="s2">is to say for example that if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:24.540" style="s2">walking down the street and I encounter</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.260" end="00:44:26.520" style="s2">someone in trouble and that trouble</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.540" end="00:44:29.550" style="s2">calls to me as something that I could</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.520" end="00:44:31.710" style="s2">conceivably do something about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.550" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">that that trouble isn&#39;t set right in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.710" end="00:44:36.240" style="s2">world is actually is actually because</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:39.210" style="s2">it&#39;s part of my experience is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:42.390" style="s2">my problem now that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.210" end="00:44:45.210" style="s2">it&#39;s my fault although it might be might</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.390" end="00:44:47.400" style="s2">not be perhaps it isn&#39;t but it might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.210" end="00:44:47.830" style="s2">but it&#39;s still my responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.400" end="00:44:50.710" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.830" end="00:44:53.020" style="s2">reasonable to consider the disruption in</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.710" end="00:44:56.380" style="s2">my experience afield than encountering</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.020" end="00:44:59.890" style="s2">someone who is in trouble produces as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.380" end="00:45:03.160" style="s2">actual disturbance in my in my being and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.890" end="00:45:05.350" style="s2">then to act as if it&#39;s my responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.160" end="00:45:07.120" style="s2">to rectify that disturbance now the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.350" end="00:45:08.770" style="s2">problem of course comes in that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.120" end="00:45:10.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know how so if you run across a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.770" end="00:45:12.310" style="s2">street alcoholic for example in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.690" end="00:45:13.840" style="s2">middle of the day and they&#39;re stumbling</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.310" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">wrong blindly and maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.840" end="00:45:17.530" style="s2">schizophrenic to boat and mumbling</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.870" style="s2">terrible things you know it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.530" end="00:45:21.550" style="s2">disturb you and it would be good if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.870" end="00:45:23.710" style="s2">could set it right but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.550" end="00:45:26.170" style="s2">how so you can&#39;t you have to avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.710" end="00:45:29.620" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.170" end="00:45:31.600" style="s2">you because it&#39;s also you and I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.620" end="00:45:33.220" style="s2">that&#39;s why in the story of the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.600" end="00:45:34.750" style="s2">for example like the Buddha was</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.220" end="00:45:37.030" style="s2">basically offered when he became</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.750" end="00:45:40.540" style="s2">enlightened the chance to remain in</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.030" end="00:45:42.760" style="s2">nirvana right as a uniquely enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.540" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">singular individual and he actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.760" end="00:45:50.380" style="s2">regret rejected that offer because it</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:52.720" style="s2">was his deepest conviction that it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.380" end="00:45:54.550" style="s2">it was not possible for one person to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.720" end="00:45:57.040" style="s2">enlightened and to be in a state of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.550" end="00:45:59.740" style="s2">Nirvana if everyone wasn&#39;t in that state</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.040" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2">at the same time and so he had to move</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.740" end="00:46:05.590" style="s2">himself out of that utopian experience</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.700" end="00:46:08.170" style="s2">of Nirvana and come back to the normal</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.590" end="00:46:09.700" style="s2">world let&#39;s say and to try to raise the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.170" end="00:46:13.330" style="s2">consciousness of people around him</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.700" end="00:46:17.880" style="s2">because he regarded that as unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.330" end="00:46:20.800" style="s2">business that was his personally and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.880" end="00:46:22.510" style="s2">now I don&#39;t remember who is oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:25.020" style="s2">that&#39;s all about cleaning your room yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.510" end="00:46:29.530" style="s2">exactly so well the thing is is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.020" end="00:46:33.610" style="s2">your your room isn&#39;t not you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.530" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">actually you and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.610" end="00:46:37.210" style="s2">difference between the chaos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">outside of you in a place that you spend</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.210" end="00:46:41.320" style="s2">as much time as you spend in your room</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:43.690" style="s2">and the chaos that&#39;s internal</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.320" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">psychologically and you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.690" end="00:46:48.760" style="s2">things I often do when I&#39;m first dealing</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.290" style="s2">with my clients - as a simple exercise</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.760" end="00:46:54.280" style="s2">in setting themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.290" end="00:46:55.330" style="s2">psychologically is to have them start to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.280" end="00:46:57.670" style="s2">clean up their external environment</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.330" end="00:46:59.560" style="s2">because in people know how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.670" end="00:47:00.550" style="s2">and there&#39;s no difference between that</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.560" end="00:47:01.250" style="s2">and putting yourself straight</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.550" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">psychologic</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.250" end="00:47:05.330" style="s2">as you know when you do something as</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:07.220" style="s2">serious is starting to clean up for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.330" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">um and so Brendon the other thing I</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.220" end="00:47:10.970" style="s2">would say is like finish cleaning your</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:12.950" style="s2">room and then see if you can make it</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.970" end="00:47:14.990" style="s2">beautiful because that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.950" end="00:47:17.420" style="s2">unbelievably useful Matt because it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.990" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">teaches you about beauty and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.420" end="00:47:20.720" style="s2">can make one room in your house</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:23.090" style="s2">beautiful and then it&#39;s organized and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.720" end="00:47:24.740" style="s2">together and beautiful and so once you</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.090" end="00:47:26.300" style="s2">do that with one room like your way</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.740" end="00:47:27.800" style="s2">wiser than you were before and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.300" end="00:47:30.740" style="s2">actually accomplished something concrete</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.800" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s solid and incontrovertible that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.740" end="00:47:34.430" style="s2">you can point to that strengthens your</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:36.050" style="s2">character and then maybe you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.430" end="00:47:37.850" style="s2">same thing with your whole house and</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.050" end="00:47:40.370" style="s2">then maybe you can do that with the more</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.850" end="00:47:41.840" style="s2">with the world around you and believe me</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.370" end="00:47:43.850" style="s2">if you start doing that you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.840" end="00:47:45.260" style="s2">to be sitting around wondering what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.850" end="00:47:49.640" style="s2">meaning of life is because you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.260" end="00:47:56.120" style="s2">to find it in that so all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.640" end="00:47:58.910" style="s2">see Max and mark says thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.120" end="00:48:00.860" style="s2">Jews huh well that&#39;s complicated most of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.910" end="00:48:02.900" style="s2">them most of my friends are Jews which</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.860" end="00:48:04.340" style="s2">is pretty interesting you know and when</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.900" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2">I grew up in northern Alberta and there</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.340" end="00:48:09.320" style="s2">were no Jews up there at all so it</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:10.850" style="s2">coming out to Eastern Canada especially</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.320" end="00:48:12.440" style="s2">in much all there are lots of Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.850" end="00:48:14.300" style="s2">people there and I made friends with</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.440" end="00:48:17.300" style="s2">lots of them and then in in my in</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.300" end="00:48:18.620" style="s2">Toronto like and I thought I think part</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.300" end="00:48:21.110" style="s2">of the reason that so many of my friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.620" end="00:48:24.320" style="s2">have been Jewish is because the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.110" end="00:48:26.480" style="s2">have you know what I&#39;m speaking in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.320" end="00:48:28.730" style="s2">very general sense is they have a rich</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:32.390" style="s2">intellectual life and tremendous respect</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.730" end="00:48:35.870" style="s2">for for intellectual pursuits and so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.390" end="00:48:37.580" style="s2">have a natural affinity and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.870" end="00:48:39.080" style="s2">more power to them as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.580" end="00:48:40.790" style="s2">concerned there&#39;s a fairer there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.080" end="00:48:42.680" style="s2">fair bit of evidence especially with</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.790" end="00:48:44.900" style="s2">regards to the Ashkenazi Jews that they</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.680" end="00:48:45.890" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re average IQs are about 15</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.900" end="00:48:48.230" style="s2">points higher than the general</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.890" end="00:48:50.210" style="s2">population which accounts in part for</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.230" end="00:48:52.280" style="s2">the radical over representation among</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.210" end="00:48:55.070" style="s2">Nobel Prize winners for example and also</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.280" end="00:48:56.690" style="s2">in positions of let&#39;s say authority and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.070" end="00:49:00.260" style="s2">responsibility in many different domains</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.690" end="00:49:03.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s like man I&#39;m not unhappy about</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.260" end="00:49:05.060" style="s2">successful people it&#39;s like as I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.050" end="00:49:07.580" style="s2">it&#39;s the same in relationship to money</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.060" end="00:49:09.020" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.580" end="00:49:11.000" style="s2">that you have a position of authority</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.020" end="00:49:12.260" style="s2">and I&#39;m not going to say power because</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.000" end="00:49:14.490" style="s2">power and authority aren&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.260" end="00:49:16.800" style="s2">thing but if you have a position of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.490" end="00:49:19.320" style="s2">authority what matters is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.800" end="00:49:21.240" style="s2">with it and so if competent people</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.320" end="00:49:22.860" style="s2">occupy positions of authority then more</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.240" end="00:49:26.190" style="s2">power to them that&#39;s lucky for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.860" end="00:49:27.960" style="s2">of us I&#39;ll tell you that so and I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.190" end="00:49:29.760" style="s2">you know have often thought this about</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.960" end="00:49:31.230" style="s2">the Jews too is that if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.760" end="00:49:33.510" style="s2">be a minority you should at least have</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.230" end="00:49:35.190" style="s2">the decency to fail and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.510" end="00:49:37.020" style="s2">part of the route because you know then</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.190" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">well you&#39;re around and you&#39;re annoying</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.020" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">because you&#39;re a minority and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2">because people are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:43.650" style="s2">ethnocentric and all human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.050" end="00:49:46.440" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.650" end="00:49:48.180" style="s2">but if minority fails then why you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.440" end="00:49:50.040" style="s2">say well at least they failed and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.180" end="00:49:51.900" style="s2">know that maybe allows you not to hate</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.040" end="00:49:54.360" style="s2">them quite as much but the Jews have</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.900" end="00:49:55.890" style="s2">this annoying proclivity where they go</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.360" end="00:49:57.510" style="s2">as a minority to become extremely</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.890" end="00:49:59.340" style="s2">successful and of course nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.510" end="00:50:00.840" style="s2">stand that and so that&#39;s a huge part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.340" end="00:50:02.250" style="s2">what accounts for anti-semitism which</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.840" end="00:50:06.660" style="s2">are regardless and absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.250" end="00:50:09.180" style="s2">I know abysmal and and and what would</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.660" end="00:50:12.810" style="s2">you call it reprehensible a priori</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.180" end="00:50:16.940" style="s2">stance you know so that&#39;s some of my</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.810" end="00:50:16.940" style="s2">thoughts about them anyways alright next</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.210" end="00:50:24.510" style="s2">how did I meet my wife and why did you</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.770" end="00:50:26.760" style="s2">marry her oh well haha I&#39;ll tell you one</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.510" end="00:50:27.930" style="s2">of the earliest memories I have my wife</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.760" end="00:50:30.300" style="s2">because it kind of tells me what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.930" end="00:50:32.040" style="s2">like gay so she lived across the street</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.300" end="00:50:34.290" style="s2">from me in this little town that we grew</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.040" end="00:50:35.550" style="s2">up in called Fairview Alberta and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.290" end="00:50:38.100" style="s2">think I fell in love with her the moment</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.550" end="00:50:39.990" style="s2">that I saw her and although I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.100" end="00:50:41.640" style="s2">think the feeling was necessarily mutual</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.990" end="00:50:43.380" style="s2">and so I was about like seven I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.640" end="00:50:47.730" style="s2">something like that so I&#39;ve known her</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.380" end="00:50:49.560" style="s2">for like forty eight years and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.730" end="00:50:51.390" style="s2">one memory because this is their two</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.560" end="00:50:54.300" style="s2">memories don&#39;t tell you so one of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.390" end="00:50:56.369" style="s2">was when I was in grade five I got</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.300" end="00:50:57.630" style="s2">glasses and I was pretty proud of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.369" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">glasses they were horn-rimmed glasses</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.630" end="00:51:02.550" style="s2">you know and I was pretty proud of them</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:04.350" style="s2">and I went out and I she came out onto</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.550" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">the street she looked at my glasses I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.350" end="00:51:07.230" style="s2">said what do you think of those and she</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:08.760" style="s2">says I think you look really funny in</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.230" end="00:51:10.920" style="s2">those and then she pointed at me and ran</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.760" end="00:51:13.109" style="s2">into her house it was like twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.920" end="00:51:14.730" style="s2">later that she finally told me that she</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.109" end="00:51:16.320" style="s2">had always wanted to have glasses and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.730" end="00:51:18.090" style="s2">she was jealous about it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.320" end="00:51:20.730" style="s2">she decided she&#39;d give me a good teasing</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.090" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">and a good poke and so that and then we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.730" end="00:51:25.109" style="s2">used to play croquet together and one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:25.410" style="s2">the great delight she would take is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.109" end="00:51:26.820" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.410" end="00:51:30.090" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever laid croquet but you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.820" end="00:51:31.170" style="s2">you&#39;re sometimes the one person&#39;s ball</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.090" end="00:51:32.970" style="s2">that they&#39;re hitting and another</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.170" end="00:51:34.980" style="s2">person&#39;s will come together and then you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.970" end="00:51:36.510" style="s2">can stand on your ball and you can nail</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.980" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">it with the croquet mallet and like</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.510" end="00:51:41.310" style="s2">knock the other person&#39;s croquet ball</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:42.930" style="s2">halfway down the block and she used to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.310" end="00:51:46.860" style="s2">think that was pretty damn amusing when</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.930" end="00:51:49.320" style="s2">she did it to me so and let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.860" end="00:51:51.510" style="s2">else can I remember about her that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.320" end="00:51:53.910" style="s2">but yeah I mean I told my dad when I was</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.510" end="00:51:57.860" style="s2">in grade five I was sitting with her on</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.910" end="00:51:59.940" style="s2">this big armchair in our living room and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.860" end="00:52:01.260" style="s2">she was sitting beside me on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.940" end="00:52:03.540" style="s2">armchair which I was pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.260" end="00:52:05.070" style="s2">thrilled about and she was being chased</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.540" end="00:52:06.600" style="s2">around by all the boys in the school at</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.070" end="00:52:08.790" style="s2">that point even though she that was in</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.600" end="00:52:11.190" style="s2">the elementary school you know so she</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.790" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">was very hot property let&#39;s say among</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.190" end="00:52:14.910" style="s2">the elementary school boys and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:17.820" style="s2">pretty happy to have her sit by me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.910" end="00:52:23.580" style="s2">so anyway she left and I told my dad</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.820" end="00:52:25.590" style="s2">that I was going to marry her and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.580" end="00:52:27.030" style="s2">remember that and he told that story at</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.590" end="00:52:28.680" style="s2">her wedding which was quite cute and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.030" end="00:52:30.450" style="s2">then I&#39;ll tell you one more story which</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.680" end="00:52:34.560" style="s2">I really think it&#39;s funny this is so</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.450" end="00:52:36.780" style="s2">funny so we we were friends when we were</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.560" end="00:52:39.000" style="s2">kids and then you know girls mature</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.780" end="00:52:40.230" style="s2">faster than boys and she&#39;s a year older</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.000" end="00:52:41.640" style="s2">than me because I skipped a grade in</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.230" end="00:52:44.220" style="s2">school we were in the same grade in</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.640" end="00:52:46.170" style="s2">school and so you know when she had</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.220" end="00:52:47.550" style="s2">about thirteen or so we kind of went our</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.170" end="00:52:50.040" style="s2">separate ways a little bit although we</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.550" end="00:52:52.020" style="s2">still remained friends and she had a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.040" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">paper route and I took her paper route</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.020" end="00:52:57.390" style="s2">over when she hit thirteen or so and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:00.540" style="s2">like quadrupled the damn thing I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.390" end="00:53:04.260" style="s2">which i think is pretty funny but I also</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.540" end="00:53:05.790" style="s2">delivered paper to her house and one day</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.260" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">she was there with another another of</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.790" end="00:53:10.140" style="s2">her friends and who was a kind of a cute</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">chick too and I liked her quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.140" end="00:53:15.620" style="s2">and they were sitting around talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:18.510" style="s2">about like talking about how they were</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.620" end="00:53:20.430" style="s2">feminists roughly speaking and they were</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.510" end="00:53:21.510" style="s2">talking when I walked in about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.430" end="00:53:23.970" style="s2">that neither of them were going to take</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.510" end="00:53:27.540" style="s2">their husband&#39;s last day when they got</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.970" end="00:53:29.190" style="s2">married and uh Tammy my wife I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.540" end="00:53:30.870" style="s2">said to her friend</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.190" end="00:53:33.540" style="s2">well that really means I&#39;m going to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.870" end="00:53:34.860" style="s2">to find some wimp and marry him and she</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.540" end="00:53:38.430" style="s2">turned around and looked at me and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.860" end="00:53:38.730" style="s2">smiled evilly and said hey Jordan do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.430" end="00:53:40.080" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.730" end="00:53:42.359" style="s2">get married and of course I&#39;d heard the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.080" end="00:53:43.859" style="s2">whole conversation and you know she knew</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.359" end="00:53:45.960" style="s2">I liked her obviously and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.859" end="00:53:48.060" style="s2">nice little comical dick she has a very</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.960" end="00:53:50.100" style="s2">vicious sense of humor and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.060" end="00:53:54.810" style="s2">kind of laughed and I thought haha okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.100" end="00:53:58.170" style="s2">yeah okay so find it so then when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.810" end="00:54:02.550" style="s2">were I was like 28 and she had come to</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.170" end="00:54:03.540" style="s2">see me in Montreal and we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.550" end="00:54:06.270" style="s2">about getting married</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.540" end="00:54:07.890" style="s2">and she said we were talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.270" end="00:54:09.570" style="s2">that would mean and then we started</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.890" end="00:54:11.420" style="s2">talking about what the name would be and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.570" end="00:54:13.740" style="s2">I said hey I&#39;ve got a story for you um</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.420" end="00:54:17.270" style="s2">remember when you were 13 and I was</p>

<p begin="00:54:17.270" end="00:54:21.030" style="s2">because I suggested that she take my</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.500" end="00:54:22.590" style="s2">last name and she wasn&#39;t so sure about</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.030" end="00:54:24.420" style="s2">that and I said well you remember that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.590" end="00:54:26.040" style="s2">little story that that little episode</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.420" end="00:54:27.540" style="s2">that we had when you were 13 and I came</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.040" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">over to your house and you told me that</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.540" end="00:54:30.990" style="s2">you weren&#39;t going to take your husband&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:31.800" style="s2">name and that you&#39;re gonna have to marry</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.990" end="00:54:34.290" style="s2">some wimp</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.800" end="00:54:35.430" style="s2">said okay well you know Here I am but</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.290" end="00:54:36.840" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re going to get married</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.430" end="00:54:39.030" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take my name and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.840" end="00:54:40.650" style="s2">the end of that argument and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.030" end="00:54:42.170" style="s2">she had the good graces to go along with</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.650" end="00:54:45.410" style="s2">that but that was actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.170" end="00:54:48.660" style="s2">Stern nearly comical and ridiculous so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.410" end="00:54:51.540" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s a good one</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.660" end="00:54:55.650" style="s2">what&#39;s my advice to young men seeking a</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.540" end="00:54:58.560" style="s2">woman for marriage and family yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.650" end="00:54:59.730" style="s2">okay fine that&#39;s the same quest second</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.560" end="00:55:02.240" style="s2">question that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.730" end="00:55:04.470" style="s2">straightforward man I mean you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.240" end="00:55:05.910" style="s2">eliminate the necessity of being</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.470" end="00:55:08.430" style="s2">attracted to one another that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.910" end="00:55:10.910" style="s2">important and that&#39;s mysterious you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.430" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">so for example here&#39;s a funny thing if</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.910" end="00:55:15.060" style="s2">you one of the things we know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:18.690" style="s2">attracts people to one another is</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.060" end="00:55:21.420" style="s2">bilateral symmetry and so if you take</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.690" end="00:55:24.810" style="s2">men and you rank them by the symmetry of</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.420" end="00:55:27.780" style="s2">their faces and then you give the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.810" end="00:55:29.640" style="s2">asymmetrical men t-shirts to wear clean</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.780" end="00:55:32.310" style="s2">t-shirts for a day and the symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.640" end="00:55:33.990" style="s2">men clean t-shirts to wear for a day and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.310" end="00:55:37.560" style="s2">then you give the t-shirts to women and</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.990" end="00:55:40.020" style="s2">you have them rate the odor the women</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.560" end="00:55:42.030" style="s2">rate the odor of the symmetrical men as</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.020" end="00:55:44.850" style="s2">more attractive than the odor of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.030" end="00:55:47.910" style="s2">asymmetrical men and then and there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.850" end="00:55:49.500" style="s2">other factors that determine sexual</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.910" end="00:55:51.900" style="s2">attractiveness that are based on</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.500" end="00:55:52.530" style="s2">biological factors that are so deeply</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.900" end="00:55:55.680" style="s2">embedded</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.530" end="00:56:00.300" style="s2">terms of smell for example so women also</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.680" end="00:56:03.960" style="s2">tend to not be sexually attracted to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.300" end="00:56:06.300" style="s2">to the scent of men who&#39;s who have if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.960" end="00:56:09.710" style="s2">remember correctly it&#39;s Rh factors that</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.300" end="00:56:13.110" style="s2">would make for potential trouble in</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.710" end="00:56:15.210" style="s2">childbirth and they&#39;re often the reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.110" end="00:56:16.680" style="s2">that the women give for not preferring</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.210" end="00:56:18.090" style="s2">the scent of those men is that they</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.680" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">smell too much like their brother</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.090" end="00:56:22.080" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:23.280" style="s2">so there is weird mysterious things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.080" end="00:56:24.810" style="s2">determine whether or not people are</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.280" end="00:56:25.950" style="s2">sexually and physically attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.810" end="00:56:28.350" style="s2">each other and I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.950" end="00:56:31.170" style="s2">important that that&#39;s part of a marital</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.350" end="00:56:34.350" style="s2">relationship the next most important</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.170" end="00:56:36.780" style="s2">thing is trust man it&#39;s like there</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.350" end="00:56:38.430" style="s2">there&#39;s no marriage that&#39;s successful</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.780" end="00:56:40.650" style="s2">without trust you guys you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.430" end="00:56:42.120" style="s2">tell each other the truth and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.650" end="00:56:45.300" style="s2">reasons that you&#39;ll believe that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.120" end="00:56:48.300" style="s2">marriage as a and the oath and a Carl</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.300" end="00:56:50.490" style="s2">Jung as a bond was necessary it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.300" end="00:56:52.530" style="s2">wise it&#39;s like you know telling the</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.490" end="00:56:54.390" style="s2">truth - someone is no simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.530" end="00:56:56.190" style="s2">because there&#39;s a bunch of things about</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.390" end="00:56:58.320" style="s2">all of us that are terrible and weak and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.190" end="00:56:59.700" style="s2">reprehensible and shameful and all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.320" end="00:57:01.350" style="s2">those things and they kind of have to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.700" end="00:57:04.590" style="s2">brought out into the open and dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.350" end="00:57:06.270" style="s2">and you&#39;re not going to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.590" end="00:57:08.040" style="s2">about yourself to someone who can run</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.270" end="00:57:11.040" style="s2">away screaming when you reveal who you</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.040" end="00:57:14.610" style="s2">are and so the marriage bond is</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.040" end="00:57:16.920" style="s2">something like okay here&#39;s the deal I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.610" end="00:57:18.480" style="s2">going to handcuff myself to you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.920" end="00:57:20.340" style="s2">you&#39;re going to handcuff yourself to me</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.480" end="00:57:22.230" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to tell each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.340" end="00:57:25.020" style="s2">the truth and neither of us are going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.230" end="00:57:26.250" style="s2">get to run away and so are once we know</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.020" end="00:57:28.170" style="s2">the truth then we&#39;re either going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.250" end="00:57:29.610" style="s2">live together in mutual torment or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.170" end="00:57:31.620" style="s2">going to try to deal with that truth and</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.610" end="00:57:33.630" style="s2">straighten our selves out and straighten</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.620" end="00:57:35.820" style="s2">ourselves out jointly and that&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="00:57:39.630" end="00:57:44.370" style="s2">as we progress together through life and</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.940" end="00:57:45.660" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s absolutely brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.370" end="00:57:47.310" style="s2">because if you leave the back door open</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.660" end="00:57:47.520" style="s2">man you&#39;re going to use it that&#39;s for</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.520" end="00:57:51.500" style="s2">and the oath is there and this was</p>

<p begin="00:57:51.500" end="00:57:57.270" style="s2">spiritualization of the human parable</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.110" end="00:58:01.440" style="s2">and by Christian marriage for example</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.270" end="00:58:03.570" style="s2">which would emphasize the the what would</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.440" end="00:58:06.299" style="s2">you call it the subordination of both</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.570" end="00:58:10.019" style="s2">members of the marital Union to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.299" end="00:58:12.509" style="s2">higher-order personality that was</p>

<p begin="00:58:12.509" end="00:58:17.309" style="s2">the idea is that in in the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.789" end="00:58:19.410" style="s2">marriage for example the man isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.309" end="00:58:23.099" style="s2">boss and the woman isn&#39;t the boss the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.410" end="00:58:26.039" style="s2">boss is the mutual personality composed</p>

<p begin="00:58:26.039" end="00:58:30.449" style="s2">and that&#39;s conceptualized as there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.140" end="00:58:33.029" style="s2">their joint subjugation to the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.449" end="00:58:36.089" style="s2">that is absolutely dead on man it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.029" end="00:58:38.209" style="s2">the ruler of your marital life should be</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.089" end="00:58:41.400" style="s2">your vow to tell each other the truth</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.209" end="00:58:43.079" style="s2">because like in hard times during your</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.400" end="00:58:45.179" style="s2">life when you&#39;ve done something stupid</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.079" end="00:58:47.069" style="s2">and idiotic that might take you down and</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.179" end="00:58:48.869" style="s2">you don&#39;t have anybody that you can turn</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.069" end="00:58:50.519" style="s2">to you know if you have a partner that</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.869" end="00:58:52.859" style="s2">you can trust you can go say hey you</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.519" end="00:58:54.599" style="s2">know I made a big financial mistake man</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.859" end="00:58:56.099" style="s2">and it&#39;s really torturing me and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.599" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">like a complete idiot and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.099" end="00:58:59.999" style="s2">dangerous and the person there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.619" style="s2">going to help you figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.999" end="00:59:03.299" style="s2">about it and they&#39;re going to know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.619" end="00:59:04.739" style="s2">when they make a stupid mistake and</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.299" end="00:59:06.509" style="s2">they&#39;re bloody well going to that they</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.739" end="00:59:07.769" style="s2">can come and talk to you and that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.509" end="00:59:10.650" style="s2">guys are going to work your way through</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.769" end="00:59:12.269" style="s2">it and that&#39;s a big deal and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.650" end="00:59:14.369" style="s2">couple of things our culture gets really</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.269" end="00:59:16.650" style="s2">wrong and one is a devalues marriage</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.369" end="00:59:17.640" style="s2">that&#39;s really a very bad idea because</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.650" end="00:59:19.949" style="s2">marriages</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.640" end="00:59:22.739" style="s2">marriage is like a third of your life</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.949" end="00:59:25.140" style="s2">and maybe more and kids are a third of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.739" end="00:59:27.449" style="s2">your life and your your your life</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.140" end="00:59:29.939" style="s2">outside of marriage and kids is a third</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.449" end="00:59:32.809" style="s2">of your life you know approximately</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.939" end="00:59:36.989" style="s2">speaking and to miss any of that is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.809" end="00:59:39.179" style="s2">massive massive mistake now having said</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.989" end="00:59:42.059" style="s2">that I will also say that for some</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.179" end="00:59:44.969" style="s2">people missing one or more of those is</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.059" end="00:59:46.709" style="s2">necessary because they have a reason you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.969" end="00:59:48.179" style="s2">know maybe they&#39;re brilliantly creative</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.709" end="00:59:49.949" style="s2">artists and they need to devote</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.179" end="00:59:51.719" style="s2">themselves entirely to their career or</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.949" end="00:59:54.479" style="s2">their outstanding in some way and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.719" end="00:59:56.999" style="s2">they meet they can justify the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.479" end="00:59:58.949" style="s2">of one part of that try out of being to</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.999" end="01:00:00.689" style="s2">another part but for but generally</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.949" end="01:00:04.229" style="s2">speaking it&#39;s a very dangerous thing and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.689" end="01:00:06.059" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t be done and also kids get</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.229" end="01:00:08.969" style="s2">an absolutely terrible rap you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.059" end="01:00:11.039" style="s2">because kids are delightful if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.969" end="01:00:12.630" style="s2">well-behaved one of the chapters in my</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.039" end="01:00:14.069" style="s2">new book is called don&#39;t let your</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.630" end="01:00:16.019" style="s2">children do anything that makes you</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.069" end="01:00:18.029" style="s2">dislike them and you can do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.019" end="01:00:18.890" style="s2">especially if you discuss it thoroughly</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.029" end="01:00:20.690" style="s2">with your</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.890" end="01:00:22.700" style="s2">spouts you&#39;re the person that&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.690" end="01:00:25.040" style="s2">you discipline the kids and children are</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.700" end="01:00:27.110" style="s2">the best company because they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.040" end="01:00:29.660" style="s2">enthusiastic about everything they love</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.110" end="01:00:32.270" style="s2">doing new things they really love you so</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.660" end="01:00:33.920" style="s2">they&#39;re happy that you&#39;re around um all</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.270" end="01:00:35.540" style="s2">you have to do is make sure they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.920" end="01:00:36.980" style="s2">too hot and they&#39;re not too cold and</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.540" end="01:00:39.800" style="s2">they&#39;ve had something to eat and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.980" end="01:00:42.770" style="s2">not too tired and you don&#39;t expect them</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.800" end="01:00:44.270" style="s2">to stay engaged in something for longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.770" end="01:00:45.530" style="s2">than they can manage because we used to</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.270" end="01:00:47.030" style="s2">take our kids when they were little out</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.530" end="01:00:48.620" style="s2">to restaurants for example and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.030" end="01:00:50.690" style="s2">could sit there no problem and behave</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.620" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">really nicely when they were 2 and 3 but</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.690" end="01:00:55.010" style="s2">they couldn&#39;t do it for more than about</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:56.630" style="s2">45 minutes you can&#39;t push your luck but</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.010" end="01:01:00.050" style="s2">I also noticed with little kids is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.630" end="01:01:02.330" style="s2">they got antsy and unreasonable about 5</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.050" end="01:01:03.950" style="s2">to 10 minutes before the adults did too</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.330" end="01:01:05.380" style="s2">it&#39;s just the adults were too stupid to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.950" end="01:01:08.810" style="s2">notice the kids would notice right away</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.380" end="01:01:10.100" style="s2">so um so back to marriage when you look</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.810" end="01:01:11.720" style="s2">for someone that you&#39;re attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.100" end="01:01:13.400" style="s2">that you love and then you look for</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.720" end="01:01:16.460" style="s2">someone that you can bloody well trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.400" end="01:01:18.260" style="s2">and then you tell them the truth and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.460" end="01:01:20.930" style="s2">that way maybe you can get through life</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.260" end="01:01:24.080" style="s2">and you can have someone to weave the</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.930" end="01:01:26.150" style="s2">Rope of your being with and together to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.080" end="01:01:27.650" style="s2">make to make your joint rope stronger</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.150" end="01:01:29.630" style="s2">and you can have some continuity in your</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.650" end="01:01:31.400" style="s2">narrative and you can have children and</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.630" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">then you can have grandchildren and like</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.400" end="01:01:36.080" style="s2">you can have a life man and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:38.960" style="s2">nothing you&#39;re so fortunate if you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.080" end="01:01:41.450" style="s2">manage that and so ok so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.960" end="01:01:43.160" style="s2">one so what&#39;s my advice to young men</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.450" end="01:01:46.760" style="s2">seeking a woman for marriage and family</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.160" end="01:01:48.230" style="s2">yeah well and also you know marry</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.760" end="01:01:50.240" style="s2">someone you think would be a good mother</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.230" end="01:01:52.070" style="s2">and that has enough sense generally</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.240" end="01:01:54.530" style="s2">speaking to know that she wants children</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.070" end="01:01:56.780" style="s2">now some women don&#39;t want children and</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.530" end="01:01:59.330" style="s2">fair enough and some women perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.780" end="01:02:02.360" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have children that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.330" end="01:02:04.850" style="s2">possible but the general rule of thumb</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.360" end="01:02:07.700" style="s2">is especially once a woman&#39;s you know in</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.850" end="01:02:10.490" style="s2">her mid-20s if she doesn&#39;t know that she</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.700" end="01:02:13.970" style="s2">wants children or won&#39;t admit it unless</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.490" end="01:02:17.180" style="s2">she has a viciously important reason</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.970" end="01:02:20.570" style="s2">then she&#39;s not oriented properly</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.180" end="01:02:21.710" style="s2">psychologically she isn&#39;t she doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.570" end="01:02:23.900" style="s2">know what&#39;s important in life</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.710" end="01:02:25.880" style="s2">now that might also be the case with you</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.900" end="01:02:30.170" style="s2">and it probably is but as a rule of</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.880" end="01:02:32.730" style="s2">thumb that&#39;s a really good one so okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.170" end="01:02:35.390" style="s2">another more spontaneous one here</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.730" end="01:02:35.390" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.530" end="01:02:50.520" style="s2">on the other hand what&#39;s your advice to</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.570" end="01:02:50.520" style="s2">high achieving females for finding a man</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.130" end="01:03:04.690" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s a tough one do I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.380" end="01:03:06.040" style="s2">to do I want to answer that question see</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.690" end="01:03:07.810" style="s2">the problem that high achieving women</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.040" end="01:03:09.610" style="s2">have and I&#39;ve dealt with a lot of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.810" end="01:03:11.440" style="s2">you know because one of the first of all</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.610" end="01:03:13.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve had a clinical practice as most of</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.440" end="01:03:14.410" style="s2">you may know and I also had a consulting</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.090" end="01:03:16.540" style="s2">practice and one of the things they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.410" end="01:03:18.490" style="s2">kind of mixed but one of the things I</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.540" end="01:03:20.770" style="s2">did for a long time was I served as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.490" end="01:03:22.510" style="s2">consultant to two people who were</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.770" end="01:03:24.250" style="s2">spectacularly successful in their</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.510" end="01:03:27.070" style="s2">careers because I worked with an agency</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.250" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">whose sales pitch basically to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.070" end="01:03:31.450" style="s2">companies or the law firms because it</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:33.100" style="s2">was mostly law firms was give us your</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.450" end="01:03:34.750" style="s2">really high achieving people and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.100" end="01:03:37.060" style="s2">help them sort out their lives even more</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.750" end="01:03:39.220" style="s2">and make them even more productive and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.060" end="01:03:40.720" style="s2">and valuable than they already are you</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.220" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">don&#39;t need much an increment in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.720" end="01:03:43.690" style="s2">value of someone who&#39;s high achieving to</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:46.780" style="s2">justify that from an economic</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.690" end="01:03:49.360" style="s2">perspective so I work with a lot of high</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.780" end="01:03:52.120" style="s2">achieving people for like 15 years and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.360" end="01:03:54.460" style="s2">still do it to some degree and a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.120" end="01:03:56.380" style="s2">them were women and a lot of them were</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.460" end="01:03:58.150" style="s2">female lawyers and they were very</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.380" end="01:03:59.770" style="s2">interesting to work with because most of</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.150" end="01:04:01.770" style="s2">them were extremely attractive and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.770" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">were very very smart and they were tough</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.770" end="01:04:06.940" style="s2">and you know they were very demanding</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">when it came to a mate because women do</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.940" end="01:04:11.710" style="s2">tend to mate across and up dominance</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:13.270" style="s2">hierarchies and if you&#39;re like very</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.710" end="01:04:14.740" style="s2">attractive and you&#39;re very intelligent</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.270" end="01:04:17.260" style="s2">you make a lot of money and you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.740" end="01:04:19.000" style="s2">competent it&#39;s like how there&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.260" end="01:04:20.890" style="s2">lot that&#39;s a cross and there&#39;s even less</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.000" end="01:04:24.280" style="s2">that&#39;s up and so that&#39;s hard on women</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.890" end="01:04:25.570" style="s2">and and it actually the way the way that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.280" end="01:04:28.060" style="s2">that actually works out is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.570" end="01:04:31.090" style="s2">especially with regards to IQ for women</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.060" end="01:04:32.530" style="s2">is that that the higher the IQ that a</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.090" end="01:04:34.360" style="s2">woman has the less likely it is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.530" end="01:04:36.100" style="s2">she&#39;s going to find a partner and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.360" end="01:04:40.080" style="s2">effect is actually quite pronounced and</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.100" end="01:04:40.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s pretty rough what&#39;s my advice</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.880" end="01:04:55.390" style="s2">while the first piece of advice probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.220" end="01:04:57.549" style="s2">would be don&#39;t pretend that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.390" end="01:05:00.069" style="s2">important because it is important and</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.549" end="01:05:01.960" style="s2">the next piece of advice I would say is</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.069" end="01:05:04.269" style="s2">and you know this is practically</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.960" end="01:05:07.359" style="s2">speaking is it&#39;s a lot easier now for</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.269" end="01:05:09.220" style="s2">people to find at least a potential</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.359" end="01:05:11.740" style="s2">partner than it was 20 years ago because</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.220" end="01:05:13.359" style="s2">you have this tremendous technology</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.740" end="01:05:14.970" style="s2">that&#39;s available with regards to opening</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:17.319" style="s2">up the dating market and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.970" end="01:05:19.809" style="s2">finding the right mate is like finding a</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.319" end="01:05:21.700" style="s2">good career the next good career move I</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.809" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">know that&#39;s not a great analogy but a</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.700" end="01:05:25.839" style="s2">huge part of that is just persistence</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:27.849" style="s2">you have to kiss a lot of frogs before</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.839" end="01:05:29.319" style="s2">you find a prince you know I suppose</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.849" end="01:05:39.000" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.319" end="01:05:41.259" style="s2">then and then I guess I would also say</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.000" end="01:05:43.900" style="s2">that&#39;s really about the best I can do</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.259" end="01:05:45.910" style="s2">man it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.900" end="01:05:47.259" style="s2">complicated question look for someone</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.910" end="01:05:48.730" style="s2">that loves you and that wants to take</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.259" end="01:05:51.670" style="s2">care of you and that and that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.730" end="01:05:53.349" style="s2">oriented to some degree towards the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.670" end="01:05:56.589" style="s2">things that you are that&#39;s also helpful</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.349" end="01:05:58.930" style="s2">but apart from the earlier things I said</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.589" end="01:06:00.730" style="s2">about attractiveness and truth you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.930" end="01:06:03.160" style="s2">that&#39;s about the best I can do it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.730" end="01:06:04.990" style="s2">very complicated question okay kenny</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.160" end="01:06:06.849" style="s2">lauderdale yeah this is a good one how</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.990" end="01:06:08.559" style="s2">do I get over my fear of driving I&#39;m an</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.559" end="01:06:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s crippling me ma&#39;am that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.029" end="01:06:14.579" style="s2">important question a lot of young adults</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.640" end="01:06:16.750" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re young or not</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.579" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have their driver&#39;s license and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.750" end="01:06:20.349" style="s2">think that&#39;s a catastrophe because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:22.450" style="s2">a real first of all it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.349" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">economically suicidal because it makes</p>

<p begin="01:06:36.730" end="01:06:40.869" style="s2">badly it&#39;s who cares if you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.289" end="01:06:42.519" style="s2">it five times you know go sit in a car</p>

<p begin="01:06:42.519" end="01:06:45.880" style="s2">you&#39;re a kid and then have them drive</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.380" end="01:06:47.410" style="s2">you around the block and like take it</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.880" end="01:06:49.960" style="s2">slow maybe it&#39;s something that&#39;ll take</p>

<p begin="01:06:51.400" end="01:06:55.269" style="s2">situation to advance yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.289" end="01:06:57.069" style="s2">psychologically because you know that</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.269" end="01:06:59.470" style="s2">there&#39;s something you should do that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.069" end="01:07:01.269" style="s2">learn to drive right that&#39;s challenging</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.470" end="01:07:03.309" style="s2">and you know that it&#39;s interfering with</p>

<p begin="01:09:45.590" end="01:09:48.260" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of work in</p>

<p begin="01:10:07.850" end="01:10:18.800" style="s2">so okay um with the majority of your</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.510" end="01:10:20.300" style="s2">audience being men how would you</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.800" end="01:10:21.740" style="s2">characterize the few women that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.300" end="01:10:23.000" style="s2">generally interested in your videos</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.740" end="01:10:26.270" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re masculine side</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.000" end="01:10:28.940" style="s2">might be preeminent I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.270" end="01:10:31.280" style="s2">answer to that I mean the thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.940" end="01:10:33.140" style="s2">tough one because it turns out that my</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.280" end="01:10:36.770" style="s2">primary audience is on YouTube and</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.140" end="01:10:38.780" style="s2">YouTube seems to be a place that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.770" end="01:10:41.860" style="s2">men are hanging out more than women now</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.780" end="01:10:46.130" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why that is it might be</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.860" end="01:10:49.610" style="s2">because men are slightly more interested</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.130" end="01:10:51.410" style="s2">in nonfiction and in ideas per se than</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.610" end="01:10:53.510" style="s2">women who are more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.410" end="01:10:55.460" style="s2">aesthetics and fiction that&#39;s how what</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.510" end="01:10:57.590" style="s2">the personality data reveals and so it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.460" end="01:11:01.220" style="s2">might be that because YouTube is has a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.590" end="01:11:04.700" style="s2">kind of an emphasis on on ideas per se</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.220" end="01:11:06.890" style="s2">and nonfiction ideas that men more</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.700" end="01:11:07.400" style="s2">gravitate towards it although that is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.890" end="01:11:08.450" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.400" end="01:11:12.140" style="s2">believe me because I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.450" end="01:11:13.910" style="s2">understand it are the women who are</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.140" end="01:11:18.730" style="s2">watching me more masculine than their</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.910" end="01:11:22.190" style="s2">orientation it&#39;s possible it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.730" end="01:11:23.540" style="s2">I&#39;m not so it&#39;s not self-evident to me</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.190" end="01:11:25.640" style="s2">why that should be the case though</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.540" end="01:11:28.670" style="s2">because I also spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.640" end="01:11:30.200" style="s2">talking about symbolic issues and and</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.670" end="01:11:31.330" style="s2">aesthetics which you think would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.200" end="01:11:32.560" style="s2">attractive to women so</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.330" end="01:11:37.030" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know the answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.560" end="01:11:38.920" style="s2">so um what should I do if every time I</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.030" end="01:11:40.210" style="s2">voluntarily confront my problems I get</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.920" end="01:11:42.520" style="s2">too overwhelmed with stress to make</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.210" end="01:11:44.830" style="s2">progress solving them oh that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.520" end="01:11:47.740" style="s2">one man okay so the first thing is take</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.830" end="01:11:49.540" style="s2">your problems like let&#39;s say that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.740" end="01:11:52.360" style="s2">take the driving example I&#39;m too afraid</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.540" end="01:11:55.330" style="s2">to drive okay then you think well what</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.360" end="01:11:56.860" style="s2">exactly does driving consist of well the</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.330" end="01:11:58.390" style="s2">first thing is is that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.860" end="01:12:00.190" style="s2">establish some kind of relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.390" end="01:12:02.680" style="s2">a car so you might think well you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.190" end="01:12:04.510" style="s2">too afraid to go online and do a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.680" end="01:12:06.730" style="s2">investigation into what cars are like</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.510" end="01:12:09.910" style="s2">like what&#39;s a good car and how do they</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.730" end="01:12:11.290" style="s2">work and you know familiarize yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.910" end="01:12:12.490" style="s2">with the car and then that makes you a</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.290" end="01:12:15.010" style="s2">little less afraid and then you think</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.490" end="01:12:16.300" style="s2">well maybe I&#39;ll just go sit out in a car</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.010" end="01:12:18.370" style="s2">and put my hands on the steering wheel</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.300" end="01:12:20.440" style="s2">and you know just kind of accustom</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.370" end="01:12:23.140" style="s2">myself to the idea of being in the car</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.440" end="01:12:24.820" style="s2">and I customized a custom myself in my</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.140" end="01:12:27.040" style="s2">imagination drive around in the car</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.820" end="01:12:30.130" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll try some driving simulators</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.040" end="01:12:31.690" style="s2">online and then then the next thing is</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.130" end="01:12:33.130" style="s2">well maybe I can find someone I can</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.690" end="01:12:34.780" style="s2">trust to train me and what we&#39;ll do is</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.130" end="01:12:36.370" style="s2">as I mentioned earlier is we&#39;ll go out</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.780" end="01:12:40.120" style="s2">to an empty parking lot on a Sunday</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.370" end="01:12:41.650" style="s2">morning and I&#39;ll drive 15 feet and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.120" end="01:12:43.780" style="s2">stop and that&#39;ll be good enough for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.650" end="01:12:46.390" style="s2">day so what you want to do if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.780" end="01:12:48.490" style="s2">overwhelmed with your problems is you</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.390" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">want to break the problems down and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.490" end="01:12:53.050" style="s2">you do this by thinking strategically</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:55.690" style="s2">you want to break the problems down into</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.050" end="01:12:58.390" style="s2">units that are small enough so that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.690" end="01:13:00.970" style="s2">can confront them and master them with a</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.390" end="01:13:03.370" style="s2">high degree of probability and you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.970" end="01:13:05.740" style="s2">you can decompose almost every stressful</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.370" end="01:13:07.330" style="s2">problem into so imagine that you have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.740" end="01:13:08.770" style="s2">stack of paper on your desk and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.330" end="01:13:10.090" style="s2">a bunch of monsters inside it that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.770" end="01:13:11.980" style="s2">don&#39;t want to face you know like</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.090" end="01:13:14.950" style="s2">homework you haven&#39;t done or taxes that</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.980" end="01:13:16.090" style="s2">you haven&#39;t finished her or you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.950" end="01:13:17.710" style="s2">trouble you&#39;re having with a</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.090" end="01:13:19.330" style="s2">bureaucratic enterprise that you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.710" end="01:13:21.310" style="s2">rather avoid it&#39;s like one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.330" end="01:13:23.830" style="s2">you can do is just the first day you</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.310" end="01:13:24.160" style="s2">might think okay Jesus I want to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.830" end="01:13:26.430" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.160" end="01:13:29.140" style="s2">all right well would I be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.430" end="01:13:31.690" style="s2">take the papers downstairs and put them</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.140" end="01:13:33.340" style="s2">on the table and spend no more than 10</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.690" end="01:13:35.830" style="s2">minutes just looking at them and</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.340" end="01:13:37.330" style="s2">organizing them and you might add then</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.830" end="01:13:39.310" style="s2">you ask yourself what would I do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.330" end="01:13:40.810" style="s2">and if the answer is yes you think okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.310" end="01:13:42.700" style="s2">that would be good enough for today and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.810" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">then the thing is you&#39;ve knocked on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.700" end="01:13:47.710" style="s2">dragon&#39;s door you know and and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:51.039" style="s2">you you you&#39;ve you&#39;ve you&#39;ve eliminated</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.710" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">the first part of the avoidance and so</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.039" end="01:13:53.829" style="s2">then you&#39;re on your way and the next day</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:13:56.020" style="s2">you might think well you know could I</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.829" end="01:13:58.300" style="s2">deal with the first page of that problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.020" end="01:14:00.460" style="s2">and you think well I could at least look</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.300" end="01:14:02.199" style="s2">at it and the trick is and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.460" end="01:14:06.340" style="s2">behavioral psychologists do all the time</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.199" end="01:14:08.800" style="s2">is identify the fear break it down into</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.340" end="01:14:10.449" style="s2">its subcomponents layout is scheduled</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.800" end="01:14:12.579" style="s2">for confronting the subcomponents and</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.449" end="01:14:14.050" style="s2">don&#39;t burden yourself more than you can</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.579" end="01:14:16.420" style="s2">tolerate and man you can make</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.050" end="01:14:17.829" style="s2">unbelievable progress that way but you</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.420" end="01:14:20.199" style="s2">know you have to be willing to give</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.829" end="01:14:23.679" style="s2">yourself credit for small achievements</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.199" end="01:14:26.139" style="s2">and that&#39;s fine because consistent small</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.679" end="01:14:28.480" style="s2">achievements add up incrementally across</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.139" end="01:14:31.659" style="s2">time into absolutely remarkable progress</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.480" end="01:14:34.210" style="s2">because it&#39;s it starts to start to get</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.659" end="01:14:35.860" style="s2">like compound interest in it on it so</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.210" end="01:14:38.050" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s what you should do and</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.860" end="01:14:39.520" style="s2">look if that doesn&#39;t work and you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.050" end="01:14:42.039" style="s2">overwhelmed that you&#39;re just absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.520" end="01:14:43.510" style="s2">in stasis then one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.039" end="01:14:45.250" style="s2">you should consider is that maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.510" end="01:14:47.139" style="s2">have an anxiety disorder maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.250" end="01:14:49.119" style="s2">depressed like maybe things have just</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.139" end="01:14:51.010" style="s2">really collapsed in on you and you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.119" end="01:14:54.010" style="s2">terrible problems like you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.010" end="01:14:55.659" style="s2">you&#39;re sick and you&#39;re you have an ill</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.010" end="01:14:57.639" style="s2">relative and you&#39;re in real financial</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.659" end="01:14:59.590" style="s2">trouble and you&#39;re unemployed it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.639" end="01:15:01.000" style="s2">that&#39;s just too much and so at that</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.590" end="01:15:02.409" style="s2">point maybe you need to go talk to</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.000" end="01:15:04.000" style="s2">someone maybe you need to consider</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.409" end="01:15:06.309" style="s2">something like temporary anti-anxiety</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.000" end="01:15:09.070" style="s2">medication or antidepressant medication</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.309" end="01:15:10.210" style="s2">and to sit down and strategize with</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.070" end="01:15:12.070" style="s2">someone about how are you going to put</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.210" end="01:15:14.530" style="s2">your life back on track and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.070" end="01:15:18.550" style="s2">also if you&#39;re in a situation like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.530" end="01:15:20.530" style="s2">and you can&#39;t find out you can&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.550" end="01:15:22.059" style="s2">therapist then try the self authoring</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.600" end="01:16:52.600" style="s2">I was wondering if you have any advice</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.860" end="01:16:55.890" style="s2">for figuring out whether vengeance is</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.600" end="01:17:00.160" style="s2">ever a good thing or is it always bad oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.890" end="01:17:01.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a good one man um look I have</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.160" end="01:17:03.850" style="s2">clients very frequently who have been</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.960" end="01:17:06.490" style="s2">seriously wronged by someone in their</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.850" end="01:17:09.010" style="s2">life and maybe that wrong doing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.490" end="01:17:10.570" style="s2">ongoing and so like they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.010" end="01:17:13.210" style="s2">possessed by the desire for revenge</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.570" end="01:17:15.160" style="s2">sometimes to homicidal levels okay so</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.210" end="01:17:17.500" style="s2">then you got to think about that really</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.160" end="01:17:20.910" style="s2">carefully because you know you say well</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.500" end="01:17:23.620" style="s2">you should forgive people it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.910" end="01:17:27.180" style="s2">no you should forgive people that repent</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.620" end="01:17:30.040" style="s2">and you should forgive people because</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.180" end="01:17:33.430" style="s2">carrying the burden of the demand for</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.040" end="01:17:35.710" style="s2">vengeance with you and being resentful</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.430" end="01:17:37.570" style="s2">about that is really hard on you and it</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.710" end="01:17:40.000" style="s2">can [ __ ] you and so it&#39;s not a great</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.570" end="01:17:41.860" style="s2">move psychologically but having said</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.000" end="01:17:43.690" style="s2">that like it&#39;s not easy to distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.860" end="01:17:45.940" style="s2">the demand the desire for vengeance from</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.690" end="01:17:47.770" style="s2">the desire for justice and part of the</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.940" end="01:17:49.570" style="s2">reason that we have a justice system is</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.770" end="01:17:51.940" style="s2">so that you can outsource</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.570" end="01:17:53.619" style="s2">your desire for vengeance to a system</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.940" end="01:17:57.460" style="s2">that alleviates your moral</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.619" end="01:18:00.099" style="s2">responsibility for going head-to-head</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.460" end="01:18:01.750" style="s2">with someone that&#39;s wrong to you so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.099" end="01:18:04.900" style="s2">a really complicated question and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.750" end="01:18:07.599" style="s2">would say I can&#39;t answer it on a generic</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.900" end="01:18:09.460" style="s2">level I&#39;d have to say it depends on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.599" end="01:18:11.290" style="s2">particulars of your situation but</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.460" end="01:18:15.389" style="s2">vengeance the problem with vengeance</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.290" end="01:18:15.389" style="s2">generally speaking is that it produces</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.480" end="01:18:21.429" style="s2">feuds like it spirals out of control you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.940" end="01:18:23.349" style="s2">know I hit you you hit me twice I hit</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.429" end="01:18:25.540" style="s2">you four times you stabbed me</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.349" end="01:18:27.340" style="s2">you know I kill your brother you kill my</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.540" end="01:18:30.040" style="s2">family you know and then soon the whole</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.340" end="01:18:31.710" style="s2">world is at war and it&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.040" end="01:18:35.770" style="s2">think that the story of Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.710" end="01:18:37.480" style="s2">really warns against and I think part of</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.770" end="01:18:39.460" style="s2">the reason that we have a justice system</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.480" end="01:18:42.550" style="s2">is actually to stop people from taking</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.460" end="01:18:44.650" style="s2">vengeance on each other so you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.550" end="01:18:46.750" style="s2">demand remember years ago Michael</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.650" end="01:18:48.520" style="s2">macaque dukakis I think that was his</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.750" end="01:18:50.110" style="s2">name he ran for president and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.520" end="01:18:51.639" style="s2">things he did that was really wrong is</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.110" end="01:18:53.409" style="s2">that when he was governor of</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.639" end="01:18:55.540" style="s2">Massachusetts he released this guy I</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.409" end="01:18:57.400" style="s2">think his name was Willie if I remember</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.540" end="01:18:59.440" style="s2">correctly and once he was released he</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.400" end="01:19:02.079" style="s2">went out raped someone if I&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.440" end="01:19:05.230" style="s2">story right and Dukakis was axe asked on</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.079" end="01:19:07.210" style="s2">national TV you know how how he would</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.230" end="01:19:08.949" style="s2">respond something like that if someone</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.210" end="01:19:10.750" style="s2">had raped his wife like someone who was</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.949" end="01:19:13.630" style="s2">released and raped his wife you know and</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.750" end="01:19:15.550" style="s2">the right response to that question is</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.630" end="01:19:17.110" style="s2">you know I&#39;d like to rip the guys lungs</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.550" end="01:19:18.730" style="s2">out and you know maybe I&#39;d stalk his</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.110" end="01:19:20.940" style="s2">house until I had the opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.730" end="01:19:23.829" style="s2">that that&#39;s what I would want to do but</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.940" end="01:19:25.869" style="s2">because I&#39;m a civilized person and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.829" end="01:19:28.270" style="s2">understand the danger of that I would</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.869" end="01:19:29.829" style="s2">cooperate with the justice system and do</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.270" end="01:19:31.389" style="s2">everything I could to ensure that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.829" end="01:19:33.969" style="s2">person was brought to justice and then I</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.389" end="01:19:36.369" style="s2">would do my best to reconcile myself</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.969" end="01:19:37.900" style="s2">without outcome even though every cell</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.369" end="01:19:39.730" style="s2">in my body would be crying out for</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.900" end="01:19:42.909" style="s2">vengeance that&#39;s the right answer</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.730" end="01:19:46.360" style="s2">but well so I&#39;ll leave that the answer</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.909" end="01:19:53.949" style="s2">to that I&#39;ll leave I&#39;ll leave it at that</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.360" end="01:19:55.690" style="s2">so yeah yeah okay let&#39;s see I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.949" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">take good big-five test I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.690" end="01:19:59.199" style="s2">there are many online where can I find</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:01.000" style="s2">the most accurate test to take well I</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.199" end="01:20:02.469" style="s2">would say wait three weeks or a month</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.000" end="01:20:03.219" style="s2">because we&#39;re going to release our</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.469" end="01:20:05.530" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.219" end="01:20:08.500" style="s2">big five aspect scale which is a scale</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.530" end="01:20:10.600" style="s2">that a student of mine called into young</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.500" end="01:20:14.860" style="s2">developed while he was working in my lab</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.600" end="01:20:17.469" style="s2">and it was partly generated by an idea</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.860" end="01:20:18.880" style="s2">that I had with another my business</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.469" end="01:20:20.050" style="s2">partner I mentioned earlier Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.880" end="01:20:23.980" style="s2">Higgins because we had talked for years</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.050" end="01:20:26.050" style="s2">about the necessity of developing a more</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.980" end="01:20:28.540" style="s2">differentiated higher resolution version</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.050" end="01:20:31.750" style="s2">of the big five which had been attempted</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.540" end="01:20:34.750" style="s2">by the people who developed the Neo PIR</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.750" end="01:20:36.550" style="s2">which has which has what had they call</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.750" end="01:20:38.469" style="s2">them facets but they weren&#39;t empirically</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.550" end="01:20:40.060" style="s2">derived so if you wait a month you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.469" end="01:20:41.680" style="s2">able to take the big five aspect scale</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.060" end="01:20:44.260" style="s2">test and it&#39;ll give you ten dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.680" end="01:20:46.510" style="s2">of personality output and I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.260" end="01:20:48.610" style="s2">it&#39;s a really good test we&#39;ve used it a</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.510" end="01:20:50.770" style="s2">lot and it&#39;s being used very widely in</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.610" end="01:20:52.840" style="s2">the relevant scientific domains the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.770" end="01:20:54.430" style="s2">papers be very highly cited I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.840" end="01:20:58.840" style="s2">been highly cited like six hundred times</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.430" end="01:21:00.610" style="s2">or something like that so so keep an eye</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.840" end="01:21:03.850" style="s2">out and that should be coming real soon</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.610" end="01:21:05.650" style="s2">so if psychedelics increase openness and</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.850" end="01:21:07.360" style="s2">openness is correlated with intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.650" end="01:21:08.949" style="s2">can psychedelics increase intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.360" end="01:21:11.350" style="s2">good question</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.949" end="01:21:13.449" style="s2">I doubt it most things don&#39;t increase</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.350" end="01:21:15.880" style="s2">fluid intelligence really hard to get an</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.449" end="01:21:17.590" style="s2">increase in fluid intelligence um you</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.880" end="01:21:22.300" style="s2">know those brain training games like</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.590" end="01:21:23.800" style="s2">Lumosity even if you play a lot of those</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.300" end="01:21:27.190" style="s2">games and they&#39;re very complex cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.800" end="01:21:29.110" style="s2">games you don&#39;t tend to experience an</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.190" end="01:21:31.840" style="s2">increase in general intelligence you get</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.110" end="01:21:33.989" style="s2">better at each game domain specifically</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.840" end="01:21:38.860" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t seem to generalize across</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.989" end="01:21:40.690" style="s2">intelligence per se so I doubt that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.860" end="01:21:46.780" style="s2">psychedelics increase intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.690" end="01:21:49.300" style="s2">openness the personality dimension see</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.780" end="01:21:51.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question because it might be</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.300" end="01:21:52.870" style="s2">that psychedelic use would increase</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.010" end="01:21:55.030" style="s2">something like divergent thinking</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.870" end="01:21:57.070" style="s2">associated with tests like the torrents</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.030" end="01:21:58.750" style="s2">tests of creativity but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.070" end="01:22:00.100" style="s2">anybody has ever tested that and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.750" end="01:22:02.080" style="s2">could consider that a form of</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.100" end="01:22:04.989" style="s2">intelligence but I think the probability</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.080" end="01:22:09.820" style="s2">that it would increase nonverbal</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.989" end="01:22:11.530" style="s2">intelligence is low and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.820" end="01:22:13.600" style="s2">because there are elements to openness</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.530" end="01:22:16.699" style="s2">that aren&#39;t reducible to psychometric</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.600" end="01:22:18.469" style="s2">intelligence so I doubt it</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.699" end="01:22:19.849" style="s2">it wonderful if we can find something</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.469" end="01:22:20.929" style="s2">that would increase intelligence but</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.849" end="01:22:24.320" style="s2">that&#39;s turned out to be something</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.929" end="01:22:25.610" style="s2">unbelievably difficult okay to what</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.320" end="01:22:27.679" style="s2">extent do you believe that discourse</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.610" end="01:22:30.229" style="s2">with moderate Muslims can lead to reform</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.679" end="01:22:31.999" style="s2">of ideology such that the gap between</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.229" end="01:22:34.369" style="s2">Islamic and Western beliefs can be</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.999" end="01:22:35.840" style="s2">bridged well I guess we&#39;re going to find</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.369" end="01:22:37.159" style="s2">out about that because that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.840" end="01:22:40.639" style="s2">things I want to do over the next couple</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.159" end="01:22:44.239" style="s2">of years it&#39;s you know I said this</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.639" end="01:22:46.400" style="s2">before but I think it&#39;s worth saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.239" end="01:22:48.999" style="s2">again as far as I can tell there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.400" end="01:22:51.949" style="s2">three states of being there is tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.999" end="01:22:54.979" style="s2">there&#39;s slavery and there&#39;s negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.949" end="01:22:57.590" style="s2">and you know tyranny tyranny and slavery</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.979" end="01:22:59.420" style="s2">are forms of war so we either enter into</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.590" end="01:23:03.380" style="s2">discourse and hopefully with the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.420" end="01:23:05.150" style="s2">moderate Muslims or we&#39;re the tyrants or</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.380" end="01:23:07.130" style="s2">they&#39;re the tyrants and were the slaves</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.150" end="01:23:09.320" style="s2">or they&#39;re the slaves and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.130" end="01:23:11.780" style="s2">war and so we bloody well better have</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.320" end="01:23:14.900" style="s2">discourse because war is what happens</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.780" end="01:23:18.199" style="s2">when discourse fails and you know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.900" end="01:23:22.190" style="s2">actually in some ways we can&#39;t really go</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.199" end="01:23:24.349" style="s2">to war anymore because we&#39;re so armed</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.190" end="01:23:25.999" style="s2">and increasingly that&#39;s also the case in</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.349" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">the Muslim world I mean look at Pakistan</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.999" end="01:23:30.010" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s developing a pretty decent</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:32.479" style="s2">nuclear-armed armament a nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.010" end="01:23:34.269" style="s2">deterrent let&#39;s say which is quite</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.479" end="01:23:37.489" style="s2">terrifying because Pakistan is one</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.269" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">unstable and dangerous place but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.489" end="01:23:40.249" style="s2">what are you going to do you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:41.599" style="s2">go to war with people who have hydrogen</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.249" end="01:23:43.130" style="s2">bombs it&#39;s like that&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.599" end="01:23:46.159" style="s2">out very well so we bloody well better</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.130" end="01:23:47.900" style="s2">learn to talk and so I&#39;m hoping you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.159" end="01:23:49.999" style="s2">I&#39;m doing this biblical series which</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.900" end="01:23:52.039" style="s2">some of you maybe know about because</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.999" end="01:23:53.719" style="s2">you&#39;re also helping to ensure that it</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.039" end="01:23:56.030" style="s2">happened and again thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.719" end="01:23:57.530" style="s2">but in parallel with that I&#39;m doing I</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.030" end="01:24:00.039" style="s2">want to do a very long series of</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.530" end="01:24:03.039" style="s2">discussions with moderate Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.039" end="01:24:06.170" style="s2">theological philosophical political</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.039" end="01:24:07.999" style="s2">practical to see if the gap between</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.170" end="01:24:10.039" style="s2">Islamic and Western beliefs can be</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.999" end="01:24:11.959" style="s2">bridged I&#39;d better be able to be bridged</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.039" end="01:24:14.199" style="s2">because we&#39;re on the same planet man and</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.959" end="01:24:16.249" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of both of us so</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.199" end="01:24:21.170" style="s2">capitulation on either side isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.249" end="01:24:23.449" style="s2">to work and and like blind ignorance of</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.170" end="01:24:24.979" style="s2">them of the dangers mutual dangers that</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.449" end="01:24:29.389" style="s2">our societies pose to one another I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.979" end="01:24:30.650" style="s2">I mean by that I mean you know to the</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.389" end="01:24:32.840" style="s2">degree that Islam</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.650" end="01:24:36.050" style="s2">Islamic societies are functional</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.840" end="01:24:38.290" style="s2">traditional societies they&#39;re threatened</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.050" end="01:24:41.360" style="s2">in that functional traditionalism by</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.290" end="01:24:43.400" style="s2">radical Western technological and</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.360" end="01:24:45.920" style="s2">philosophical revolution just like Wirth</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.400" end="01:24:48.400" style="s2">threatened as Westerners ourselves by</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.920" end="01:24:53.270" style="s2">our own technological and philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.400" end="01:24:55.909" style="s2">revolutionary nature discourse truthful</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.270" end="01:24:57.350" style="s2">discourse man that&#39;s that&#39;s the hope for</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.909" end="01:24:59.120" style="s2">the salvation of the world and so</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.350" end="01:25:01.820" style="s2">hopefully we&#39;ll put it into practice</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.120" end="01:25:03.080" style="s2">I&#39;ve met a number of moderate Muslims</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.820" end="01:25:04.610" style="s2">already in Canada who are extremely</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.080" end="01:25:06.679" style="s2">interested in this sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.610" end="01:25:10.820" style="s2">some in the u.s. as well and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.679" end="01:25:18.530" style="s2">that well you know it&#39;s worth a try man</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.820" end="01:25:20.330" style="s2">so okay another live one just tuned in</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.530" end="01:25:25.159" style="s2">says logic bugs how many times should I</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.330" end="01:25:27.290" style="s2">clean my room clean your room until when</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.159" end="01:25:28.340" style="s2">you go in there you start doing things</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.290" end="01:25:31.010" style="s2">that are good for you</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.340" end="01:25:34.010" style="s2">so because cleaning it isn&#39;t just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.010" end="01:25:35.330" style="s2">just organized it&#39;s not just making sure</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.010" end="01:25:37.880" style="s2">that it&#39;s not messy man</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.330" end="01:25:40.670" style="s2">it&#39;s organizing it so that it&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.880" end="01:25:42.530" style="s2">where your being can properly manifest</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.670" end="01:25:44.030" style="s2">itself it&#39;s a place that should invite</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.530" end="01:25:45.949" style="s2">you to do the things that are good for</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.030" end="01:25:47.659" style="s2">you in the world and so you should be</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.949" end="01:25:49.489" style="s2">thinking when you have a room if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.659" end="01:25:51.500" style="s2">fortunate I have to have a room you</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.489" end="01:25:54.110" style="s2">think okay I want to organize this room</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.500" end="01:25:55.580" style="s2">so that the probability that all do the</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.110" end="01:25:57.440" style="s2">things that I know I should do is</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.580" end="01:25:59.330" style="s2">maximally heightened you know get</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.440" end="01:26:01.340" style="s2">yourself a good desk if you need a desk</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.330" end="01:26:03.140" style="s2">get yourself a good bed that you like</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.340" end="01:26:04.730" style="s2">like set the bloody place up so that</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.140" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">when you walk in there you think Jesus a</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.730" end="01:26:08.360" style="s2">civilized human being could really live</p>

<p begin="01:26:08.360" end="01:26:12.140" style="s2">there your room will remind you that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.489" end="01:26:14.780" style="s2">proper way to behave in there is to</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.270" end="01:26:30.890" style="s2">look good in front of the world but as</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.100" end="01:26:34.310" style="s2">someone who&#39;s toughened and and able and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.890" end="01:26:35.570" style="s2">and and caring and reliable and all of</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.310" end="01:26:37.429" style="s2">that and that&#39;s what you really should</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.570" end="01:26:39.290" style="s2">tell you so set the damn thing up until</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.429" end="01:26:41.860" style="s2">that&#39;s what it screams at you when you</p>

<p begin="01:26:41.860" end="01:26:50.119" style="s2">okay what is my IQ it&#39;s less than it</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.960" end="01:26:52.579" style="s2">used to be because it declines as you</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.119" end="01:26:54.440" style="s2">age you know quite a lot so you start</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.579" end="01:26:57.650" style="s2">getting stupider from an IQ perspective</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.440" end="01:26:59.420" style="s2">at about 22 or 23 so and the best way to</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.650" end="01:27:03.320" style="s2">regulate that is to engage in physical</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.420" end="01:27:04.880" style="s2">exercise just so you all know so on both</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.320" end="01:27:06.260" style="s2">weight lifting and cardiovascular</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.880" end="01:27:08.929" style="s2">exercise are really good for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.260" end="01:27:11.840" style="s2">maintenance of intelligence I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.929" end="01:27:16.489" style="s2">what my IQ is I had it tested at one</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.840" end="01:27:18.290" style="s2">point it&#39;s in excess of a hundred and</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.489" end="01:27:22.730" style="s2">fifty but I don&#39;t know exactly where it</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.290" end="01:27:25.460" style="s2">lands now I should I should what qualify</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.730" end="01:27:27.380" style="s2">that to some degree you know as your</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.460" end="01:27:29.510" style="s2">intelligence increases the scatter</p>

<p begin="01:27:32.599" end="01:27:37.880" style="s2">so you might say that there&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.510" end="01:27:40.969" style="s2">way to be stupid but there&#39;s many ways</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.880" end="01:27:42.889" style="s2">to be intelligent and so I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.889" end="01:27:48.050" style="s2">quantitative perspective you know I I</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.530" end="01:27:50.869" style="s2">think my GRE scores for on the</p>

<p begin="01:27:52.880" end="01:27:56.270" style="s2">given that you know you&#39;re competing</p>

<p begin="01:27:56.270" end="01:27:59.929" style="s2">graduate school but there&#39;s a big</p>

<p begin="01:28:06.079" end="01:28:10.610" style="s2">can certainly see that I have gaps in my</p>

<p begin="01:28:20.810" end="01:28:23.420" style="s2">definitely got an edge on me</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.920" end="01:28:24.949" style="s2">quantitatively and I&#39;ve had students</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.420" end="01:28:26.480" style="s2">like that too who like could pick up</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.949" end="01:28:28.670" style="s2">statistics I had one student who was</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.480" end="01:28:32.300" style="s2">little on the autistic side and that</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.670" end="01:28:34.670" style="s2">that she was a woman man not woman she</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.300" end="01:28:37.670" style="s2">was so damn smart she she learned how to</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.670" end="01:28:39.170" style="s2">write moved from you know credible</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.670" end="01:28:40.909" style="s2">writer to an excellent writer in about</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.170" end="01:28:42.199" style="s2">four months which was stellar and she</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.909" end="01:28:43.760" style="s2">moved from not knowing a damn thing</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.199" end="01:28:45.500" style="s2">about statistics to being able to teach</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.760" end="01:28:47.599" style="s2">it to Harvard undergraduates at an</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.500" end="01:28:50.000" style="s2">award-winning level within a year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.599" end="01:28:51.619" style="s2">like that just made my jaw drop now she</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.000" end="01:28:53.360" style="s2">had a hell of a time presenting herself</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.619" end="01:28:54.090" style="s2">properly in public when she was doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.360" end="01:28:56.010" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.090" end="01:29:00.630" style="s2">patience so you know she had other gaps</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.010" end="01:29:02.820" style="s2">in her ability but you know I can hold</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.630" end="01:29:04.500" style="s2">my own verbally and I&#39;m rarely in a</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.820" end="01:29:06.840" style="s2">situation where I feel like I&#39;m at a</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.500" end="01:29:08.430" style="s2">disadvantage verbally but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.840" end="01:29:10.380" style="s2">certainly not the case quantitatively I</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.430" end="01:29:15.330" style="s2">feel at a disadvantage very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.380" end="01:29:16.950" style="s2">quantitatively so I would love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.330" end="01:29:18.810" style="s2">you do a lecture series on raising</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.950" end="01:29:22.530" style="s2">children properly is that something you</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.810" end="01:29:25.110" style="s2">would consider yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.530" end="01:29:27.990" style="s2">we&#39;ll see you know I&#39;m really curious to</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.110" end="01:29:29.790" style="s2">see what sort of response this book I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.990" end="01:29:31.590" style="s2">going to publish gets especially this</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.790" end="01:29:33.240" style="s2">chapter on don&#39;t let your children do</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.590" end="01:29:35.280" style="s2">anything that makes you dislike them</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.240" end="01:29:38.040" style="s2">because in some sense I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.280" end="01:29:40.200" style="s2">the propositions I put forth aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.040" end="01:29:42.810" style="s2">exactly what you would normally hear</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.200" end="01:29:44.340" style="s2">surprise surprise in in the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.810" end="01:29:46.230" style="s2">milieu that surrounds children right now</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.340" end="01:29:47.700" style="s2">because everybody and their dog is</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.230" end="01:29:50.400" style="s2">afraid of disciplining children and</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.700" end="01:29:51.930" style="s2">that&#39;s really stupid because what yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.400" end="01:29:55.320" style="s2">stupid is right is the right word</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.930" end="01:29:57.780" style="s2">because undisciplined children are</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.320" end="01:30:01.020" style="s2">terrified and the reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.780" end="01:30:03.470" style="s2">terrified is they sorry got to change</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.020" end="01:30:03.470" style="s2">the battery</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.139" end="01:31:32.559" style="s2">and hopefully we&#39;re back let&#39;s see okay</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.030" end="01:31:34.119" style="s2">um mr. Cuban says why is it so important</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.559" end="01:31:36.429" style="s2">to have kids if the world has an</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.119" end="01:31:38.199" style="s2">overpopulation problem well who says the</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.429" end="01:31:41.320" style="s2">world has an overpopulation problem I</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.199" end="01:31:43.869" style="s2">don&#39;t buy that so it depends on whether</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.320" end="01:31:45.820" style="s2">you think that human brains are the kind</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.869" end="01:31:47.860" style="s2">of resource that figures out how to do</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.820" end="01:31:49.419" style="s2">more with less and that is what I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.860" end="01:31:51.280" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s been a huge argument for</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.419" end="01:31:53.919" style="s2">years between the economists and the</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.280" end="01:31:56.619" style="s2">biologists you know the biologists often</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.919" end="01:31:58.360" style="s2">are pessimistic and they basically adopt</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.619" end="01:32:00.939" style="s2">a Malthusian perspective and that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.360" end="01:32:04.149" style="s2">that we&#39;ll continue to breed until we</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.939" end="01:32:06.010" style="s2">exhaust the planet and do in our all of</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.149" end="01:32:08.559" style="s2">our resources and The Economist&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.010" end="01:32:10.179" style="s2">counter that by saying hey don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.559" end="01:32:11.499" style="s2">forgetting that we can constantly figure</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.179" end="01:32:13.389" style="s2">out how to do more with less and that</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.499" end="01:32:15.059" style="s2">we&#39;re pretty damn smart and I&#39;m afraid</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.389" end="01:32:17.889" style="s2">I&#39;m on the side of the economist but</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.059" end="01:32:19.510" style="s2">even more to the point you know the</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.889" end="01:32:20.709" style="s2">projections right now indicate that</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.510" end="01:32:23.019" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably peak somewhere around</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.709" end="01:32:24.999" style="s2">nine or ten billion something sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.019" end="01:32:26.380" style="s2">by the middle of the 21st century and</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.999" end="01:32:28.840" style="s2">then our population will start to</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.380" end="01:32:29.949" style="s2">decline pretty precipitously and I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.840" end="01:32:31.689" style="s2">there&#39;s every reason to assume</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.949" end="01:32:34.139" style="s2">especially at our current rate of</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.689" end="01:32:36.789" style="s2">technological progress progression and</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.139" end="01:32:39.130" style="s2">our increasing willingness to take</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.789" end="01:32:41.110" style="s2">broader responsibilities for the for the</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.130" end="01:32:42.550" style="s2">large-scale health of the planet that</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.110" end="01:32:43.899" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to manage that without too</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.550" end="01:32:45.519" style="s2">much problem we can certainly grow</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.899" end="01:32:48.010" style="s2">enough food to do it if we put a little</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.519" end="01:32:49.599" style="s2">bit of effort into that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.010" end="01:32:51.039" style="s2">squeeze out a lot of other animals on</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.599" end="01:32:53.349" style="s2">the way I&#39;m afraid especially some of</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.039" end="01:32:55.449" style="s2">the big predators and and mammals that</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.349" end="01:32:58.179" style="s2">are of approximately our size and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.449" end="01:33:00.189" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a price to be paid so I</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.179" end="01:33:02.169" style="s2">think there&#39;s more Tigers now in Texas</p>
<p begin="01:33:00.189" end="01:33:03.729" style="s2">just in case you&#39;re wondering then there</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.169" end="01:33:06.399" style="s2">is in the wild and the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.729" end="01:33:07.809" style="s2">and so but you know Tigers tend to eat</p>
<p begin="01:33:06.399" end="01:33:10.929" style="s2">children and so it&#39;s kind of rough</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.809" end="01:33:12.639" style="s2">having them around but in any case I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.929" end="01:33:13.950" style="s2">not worried that we&#39;re going to over</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.639" end="01:33:16.620" style="s2">populate the planet and</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.950" end="01:33:18.060" style="s2">and and and destroy everything and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.620" end="01:33:19.530" style="s2">think that that&#39;s thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.060" end="01:33:23.340" style="s2">basically hasn&#39;t advanced since the</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.530" end="01:33:26.940" style="s2">1960s because we are making tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.340" end="01:33:28.560" style="s2">progress in in pulling people out of the</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.940" end="01:33:31.380" style="s2">lower echelons of poverty and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.560" end="01:33:32.820" style="s2">lot of terrible resource misuse at the</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.380" end="01:33:34.860" style="s2">lower echelon of the poverty</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.820" end="01:33:38.610" style="s2">distribution so for example when people</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.860" end="01:33:40.290" style="s2">have to cook with wood you know that</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.610" end="01:33:42.360" style="s2">produces a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.290" end="01:33:44.850" style="s2">deforestation for example and that kind</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.360" end="01:33:46.380" style="s2">of thing and I think we&#39;ll get Iraq</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.850" end="01:33:48.630" style="s2">together if we&#39;re fortunate will peak</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.380" end="01:33:51.300" style="s2">around nine billion that will we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.630" end="01:33:53.070" style="s2">worrying about depopulation by the time</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.300" end="01:33:58.560" style="s2">some of the young you younger people are</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.070" end="01:33:59.610" style="s2">old and besides you have kids because</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.560" end="01:34:03.960" style="s2">that&#39;s part of life</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.610" end="01:34:05.520" style="s2">so and it&#39;s it&#39;s the two things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.960" end="01:34:08.340" style="s2">related in some sense as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.520" end="01:34:10.770" style="s2">concerned so the trick is to have kids</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.340" end="01:34:13.460" style="s2">that are more good than harm you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.770" end="01:34:15.870" style="s2">what I mean because maybe because people</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.460" end="01:34:18.090" style="s2">aren&#39;t only consumers they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.870" end="01:34:20.850" style="s2">producers it&#39;s kind of appalling that we</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.090" end="01:34:21.870" style="s2">regard ourselves as consumers so you</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.850" end="01:34:23.610" style="s2">know if you&#39;re going to have kids have</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.870" end="01:34:25.380" style="s2">good kids make them smart make them</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.610" end="01:34:27.630" style="s2">tough help them be tough you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.380" end="01:34:29.040" style="s2">really make them help them be tough help</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.630" end="01:34:31.680" style="s2">them be smart help them be responsible</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.040" end="01:34:34.200" style="s2">and then you know maybe they&#39;ll do good</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.680" end="01:34:37.050" style="s2">and and that would be good for the world</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.200" end="01:34:41.460" style="s2">and people and like I&#39;m pro people man</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.050" end="01:34:43.380" style="s2">and so I&#39;m not worried about that so so</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.460" end="01:34:45.750" style="s2">you know I heard a university professor</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.380" end="01:34:48.270" style="s2">once who I also thought was completely</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.750" end="01:34:49.800" style="s2">reprehensible who was like lecturing to</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.270" end="01:34:51.630" style="s2">a group of eighteen year old kids about</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.800" end="01:34:53.190" style="s2">how he and his wife had only decided to</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.630" end="01:34:54.960" style="s2">have one child because you know they</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.190" end="01:34:57.510" style="s2">didn&#39;t want overpopulate the world and I</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.960" end="01:34:59.430" style="s2">thought that if he had only managed to</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.510" end="01:35:01.110" style="s2">reproduce one genetic copy of him that</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.430" end="01:35:03.630" style="s2">was probably for the best but then he</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.110" end="01:35:04.800" style="s2">told the whole roomful of 18-year olds</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.630" end="01:35:06.510" style="s2">that they should really think seriously</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.800" end="01:35:08.040" style="s2">about whether they have kids and if they</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.510" end="01:35:09.960" style="s2">have any they should just have one and I</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.040" end="01:35:13.830" style="s2">thought you son of a [ __ ] you know</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.960" end="01:35:16.320" style="s2">you&#39;re such a you&#39;re so dedicated to to</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.830" end="01:35:18.690" style="s2">the destruction of humanity and so rife</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.320" end="01:35:20.400" style="s2">with hatred for the human race that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.690" end="01:35:22.020" style="s2">dare to stand in front of kids who are</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.400" end="01:35:23.790" style="s2">just beginning their lives and say well</p>

<p begin="01:35:41.070" end="01:35:46.380" style="s2">havoc on the oceans but boy onslaught</p>

<p begin="01:35:50.280" end="01:35:54.630" style="s2">Dutch kid has figured out he thinks how</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.100" end="01:35:56.429" style="s2">to get rid of half the plastic in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.630" end="01:35:58.170" style="s2">oceans in the next five years so you can</p>

<p begin="01:35:58.170" end="01:36:03.239" style="s2">thing to do he&#39;s a real genius and</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.850" end="01:36:05.760" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of ways that the burden</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.239" end="01:36:07.920" style="s2">that we&#39;re placing on the our planetary</p>
<p begin="01:36:05.760" end="01:36:09.120" style="s2">resources is going to be lifted and the</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.920" end="01:36:10.800" style="s2">trick is to get out there and do</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.120" end="01:36:12.750" style="s2">something about it you know like Elon</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.800" end="01:36:14.489" style="s2">Musk is a good example it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.750" end="01:36:16.139" style="s2">well maybe we&#39;re burning too many fossil</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.489" end="01:36:17.790" style="s2">fuels and maybe not because I think the</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.139" end="01:36:19.710" style="s2">dangers of carbon dioxide are actually</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.790" end="01:36:21.780" style="s2">somewhat overstated I think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.710" end="01:36:23.520" style="s2">decent evidence for that too but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.780" end="01:36:25.949" style="s2">hard to sort it out because so much of</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.520" end="01:36:28.290" style="s2">the climate change argument is</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.949" end="01:36:30.449" style="s2">predicated on an underlying philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.290" end="01:36:31.650" style="s2">such that if you&#39;re anti-capitalist you</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.449" end="01:36:33.900" style="s2">believe that we&#39;re going to burn up the</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.650" end="01:36:35.639" style="s2">planet and that&#39;s just not helpful</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.900" end="01:36:37.409" style="s2">because I can&#39;t tell if your science is</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.639" end="01:36:38.400" style="s2">right or if you&#39;re just anti Western and</p>
<p begin="01:36:37.409" end="01:36:41.670" style="s2">anti-capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.400" end="01:36:45.600" style="s2">so and like I spent three years working</p>
<p begin="01:36:41.670" end="01:36:47.580" style="s2">on a UN committee that secretary the</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.600" end="01:36:49.409" style="s2">Secretary General&#39;s high-level panel on</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.580" end="01:36:51.840" style="s2">economic sustainability I think it was</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.409" end="01:36:53.969" style="s2">called and it produced a report in 2013</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.840" end="01:36:55.739" style="s2">and I spent about three years reading</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.969" end="01:36:57.900" style="s2">everything I could get my hands on on</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.739" end="01:37:00.239" style="s2">economic development and environmental</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.900" end="01:37:02.100" style="s2">sustainability and the state of the</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.239" end="01:37:04.830" style="s2">planet is far less dismal than the dew</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.100" end="01:37:06.150" style="s2">sayers would have you believe I do think</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.830" end="01:37:09.150" style="s2">that the one thing that we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="01:37:06.150" end="01:37:11.639" style="s2">like we&#39;re fishing out the oceans like</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.150" end="01:37:15.989" style="s2">idiotically it&#39;s really really awful and</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.639" end="01:37:18.330" style="s2">trawling is a very damaging process and</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.989" end="01:37:20.010" style="s2">and I think that like if we left the</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.330" end="01:37:22.620" style="s2">damn oceans alone for about 15 years</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.010" end="01:37:24.239" style="s2">they recover not the great but a huge</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.620" end="01:37:25.830" style="s2">fish like tuna because they take a long</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.239" end="01:37:27.570" style="s2">time to develop but oceans would come</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.830" end="01:37:29.100" style="s2">back really quickly and you know but I</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.570" end="01:37:30.480" style="s2">think we&#39;ll get smart enough to do that</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.100" end="01:37:32.429" style="s2">sort of thing over the next 50 years</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.480" end="01:37:34.080" style="s2">because you know human beings aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.429" end="01:37:37.199" style="s2">stupid and we&#39;ve actually only been</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.080" end="01:37:39.530" style="s2">worried about the planet let&#39;s say since</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.199" end="01:37:41.270" style="s2">about 1960 it was only a hundred years</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.530" end="01:37:43.910" style="s2">oh that it was more or less self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.270" end="01:37:46.430" style="s2">that the the natural world was</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.910" end="01:37:49.100" style="s2">inexhaustible in comparison to the puny</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.430" end="01:37:50.570" style="s2">efforts of humanity and you know we only</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.100" end="01:37:52.790" style="s2">figured out that there was enough of us</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.570" end="01:37:54.590" style="s2">to cause trouble by about 1960 for</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.790" end="01:37:57.710" style="s2">Christ&#39;s sake how long do you expect us</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.590" end="01:37:59.150" style="s2">to how long do you expect it it to take</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.710" end="01:38:01.790" style="s2">us to figure out how to take care of a</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.150" end="01:38:03.110" style="s2">whole planet you know we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.790" end="01:38:04.550" style="s2">pretty good job for people who only</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.110" end="01:38:06.470" style="s2">stumble on to the idea that there might</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.550" end="01:38:08.390" style="s2">be a problem something like 60 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.470" end="01:38:10.610" style="s2">so I think we&#39;ll get it right</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.390" end="01:38:12.500" style="s2">especially if more and more people start</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.610" end="01:38:15.110" style="s2">to act responsibly and truthfully and</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.500" end="01:38:16.640" style="s2">all of that which and and start working</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.110" end="01:38:19.910" style="s2">for the betterment of things instead of</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.640" end="01:38:23.120" style="s2">trying to you know undermining and and</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.910" end="01:38:24.410" style="s2">hurt and and you know engaging identity</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.120" end="01:38:28.240" style="s2">politics and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.410" end="01:38:32.210" style="s2">reprehensible reprehensible activity</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.240" end="01:38:33.590" style="s2">okay let&#39;s see what are your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.210" end="01:38:38.840" style="s2">using psychedelics to help people</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.590" end="01:38:40.580" style="s2">overcome traumatic experiences hey be</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.840" end="01:38:42.440" style="s2">careful because psychedelics can cause</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.580" end="01:38:44.180" style="s2">traumatic experiences like those things</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.440" end="01:38:46.460" style="s2">are no joke man</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.180" end="01:38:49.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t think we know enough about them</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.460" end="01:38:52.220" style="s2">yet to make useful generalizations about</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.850" end="01:38:54.350" style="s2">their hypothetical clinical utility</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.220" end="01:38:57.260" style="s2">there&#39;s some decent studies indicating</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.350" end="01:38:58.880" style="s2">with psilocybin for example that it</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.260" end="01:39:00.350" style="s2">might have utility in the treatment of</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.880" end="01:39:02.420" style="s2">depression it looks like it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.350" end="01:39:04.160" style="s2">effective smoking cessation medication</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.420" end="01:39:07.280" style="s2">which is really cool</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.160" end="01:39:08.810" style="s2">so but I think what happened was that</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.280" end="01:39:11.030" style="s2">when the psychedelics burst onto the</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.810" end="01:39:13.850" style="s2">scene in the 1960s they terrified us so</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.030" end="01:39:15.650" style="s2">much that that like we all recoiled at</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.850" end="01:39:17.420" style="s2">their very existence and then decided</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.650" end="01:39:19.340" style="s2">not to exactly try to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.420" end="01:39:21.020" style="s2">they were and I can understand that man</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.340" end="01:39:23.830" style="s2">because those things are seriously weird</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.020" end="01:39:26.750" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.830" end="01:39:28.400" style="s2">strange I don&#39;t think we understand them</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.750" end="01:39:29.390" style="s2">at all I don&#39;t think we understand them</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.400" end="01:39:31.730" style="s2">any more than we understand</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.390" end="01:39:34.640" style="s2">consciousness I think that they may have</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.730" end="01:39:37.610" style="s2">great therapeutic utility but you know</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.640" end="01:39:39.560" style="s2">there are viciously powerful medications</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.610" end="01:39:41.660" style="s2">and weapons and so you use them at your</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.560" end="01:39:43.010" style="s2">own peril something to that Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.660" end="01:39:44.660" style="s2">said which I really like because he</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.010" end="01:39:45.980" style="s2">talked about psychedelic use a little</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.660" end="01:39:47.540" style="s2">bit although he was pretty old by the</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.980" end="01:39:50.360" style="s2">time the psychedelics burst on the scene</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.540" end="01:39:51.630" style="s2">you know he said beware of unearned</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.360" end="01:39:53.730" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.630" end="01:39:56.520" style="s2">and I really like that because even if</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.730" end="01:39:58.380" style="s2">the psychedelics can open the gates of</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.520" end="01:40:00.630" style="s2">perception and flood you momentarily</p>
<p begin="01:39:58.380" end="01:40:03.000" style="s2">with you know with information of</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.630" end="01:40:04.230" style="s2">genuine cosmic significance that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.000" end="01:40:06.630" style="s2">mean that you&#39;re the sort of character</p>
<p begin="01:40:04.230" end="01:40:09.120" style="s2">you&#39;re not the sort of vessel that can</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.630" end="01:40:10.860" style="s2">tolerate being filled with that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.120" end="01:40:13.110" style="s2">divine fluid you know it might just</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.860" end="01:40:15.870" style="s2">break and crack you so I would say you</p>

<p begin="01:40:15.870" end="01:40:19.560" style="s2">trepidation you should have the same</p>
<p begin="01:40:17.820" end="01:40:21.390" style="s2">attitude toward psychedelics that the</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.560" end="01:40:23.190" style="s2">ancient Israelites had towards the Ark</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.390" end="01:40:24.840" style="s2">of the Covenant which was that you know</p>
<p begin="01:40:23.190" end="01:40:27.270" style="s2">God was in there but if you touched it</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.840" end="01:40:30.870" style="s2">accidentally you would die nuts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.270" end="01:40:33.720" style="s2">pretty good that&#39;s a pretty good general</p>
<p begin="01:40:30.870" end="01:40:35.430" style="s2">attitude to have with regards to any</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.720" end="01:40:37.620" style="s2">serious encounter with psychedelics</p>
<p begin="01:40:35.430" end="01:40:40.080" style="s2">those things require respect they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.620" end="01:40:42.210" style="s2">toys they&#39;re not games they&#39;re not fun</p>

<p begin="01:40:45.620" end="01:40:56.820" style="s2">treating with tremendous respect oh if</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.290" end="01:40:58.410" style="s2">we have betrayed or let people down in</p>

<p begin="01:40:58.410" end="01:41:02.340" style="s2">guilt turning pathological oh well</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.750" end="01:41:04.320" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s actually fairly</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.340" end="01:41:06.000" style="s2">straightforward the first thing I would</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.320" end="01:41:09.200" style="s2">say is you can try using the past</p>

<p begin="01:41:13.290" end="01:41:18.060" style="s2">issue man it&#39;s like you did something</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.840" end="01:41:20.580" style="s2">wrong and it&#39;s hurting you</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.060" end="01:41:22.850" style="s2">fair enough that hurts people and what</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.580" end="01:41:26.520" style="s2">you have to do is you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.850" end="01:41:29.040" style="s2">what it was that you did wrong you have</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.520" end="01:41:31.500" style="s2">to figure out how it was that you got</p>
<p begin="01:41:29.040" end="01:41:33.420" style="s2">there you have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.500" end="01:41:36.240" style="s2">change your life so that you won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.420" end="01:41:38.360" style="s2">there anymore you have to make amends</p>
<p begin="01:41:36.240" end="01:41:40.620" style="s2">for what you&#39;ve done not necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:41:38.360" end="01:41:42.540" style="s2">precisely to the people that you did it</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.620" end="01:41:44.940" style="s2">to because maybe you can&#39;t but you need</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.540" end="01:41:46.680" style="s2">to start to live your life in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:41:44.940" end="01:41:48.540" style="s2">makes amends for what you&#39;ve done and</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.680" end="01:41:51.270" style="s2">then you have to let it go because</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.540" end="01:41:52.800" style="s2">people make mistakes and torturing</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.270" end="01:41:55.620" style="s2">yourself to death because you did</p>
<p begin="01:41:52.800" end="01:41:58.860" style="s2">something reprehensible and stupid isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.620" end="01:42:01.140" style="s2">as useful as using the experience to</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.860" end="01:42:03.859" style="s2">transform yourself into someone moral</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.140" end="01:42:06.260" style="s2">and useful so</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.859" end="01:42:08.510" style="s2">now you know that&#39;s that&#39;s easier said</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.260" end="01:42:10.070" style="s2">than done obviously and I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:42:08.510" end="01:42:12.499" style="s2">in the least taking it lightly I know</p>
<p begin="01:42:10.070" end="01:42:14.119" style="s2">that you know you can do things in your</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.499" end="01:42:17.959" style="s2">life that are very bad and that are very</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.119" end="01:42:20.119" style="s2">hard to get over but but adding your own</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.959" end="01:42:21.649" style="s2">misery to the misery of the world when</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.119" end="01:42:23.719" style="s2">you could be out there doing good is</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.649" end="01:42:28.249" style="s2">probably not the best way to atone for</p>
<p begin="01:42:23.719" end="01:42:30.019" style="s2">your for your past sins so you know and</p>
<p begin="01:42:28.249" end="01:42:31.729" style="s2">and people make mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.019" end="01:42:33.349" style="s2">the trick is once you&#39;ve made it to</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.729" end="01:42:35.839" style="s2">admit that you made it to learn why you</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.349" end="01:42:37.249" style="s2">made it to transform yourself so you</p>
<p begin="01:42:35.839" end="01:42:38.749" style="s2">don&#39;t make it anymore and then to go out</p>
<p begin="01:42:37.249" end="01:42:40.939" style="s2">there and start acting like a proper</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.749" end="01:42:43.369" style="s2">person and so one of the reasons I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:40.939" end="01:42:45.229" style="s2">also kind of attracted to some of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.369" end="01:42:46.669" style="s2">more fundamental elements of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.229" end="01:42:48.679" style="s2">Christian doctrine because there is a</p>
<p begin="01:42:46.669" end="01:42:50.599" style="s2">doctrine of universal forgiveness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.679" end="01:42:52.579" style="s2">embedded in that system but in the idea</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.599" end="01:42:53.149" style="s2">there basically is that well people are</p>
<p begin="01:42:52.579" end="01:42:56.749" style="s2">fallible</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.149" end="01:43:00.019" style="s2">in a profound way but if they atone they</p>
<p begin="01:42:56.749" end="01:43:00.949" style="s2">can be redeemed and if they&#39;re penitent</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.019" end="01:43:02.839" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s where the word</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.949" end="01:43:05.449" style="s2">penitentiary come from comes from by the</p>
<p begin="01:43:02.839" end="01:43:08.479" style="s2">way if they&#39;re penitent if they go over</p>
<p begin="01:43:05.449" end="01:43:10.669" style="s2">their conscience if they confess to what</p>
<p begin="01:43:08.479" end="01:43:13.429" style="s2">they&#39;ve done to themselves to God in</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.669" end="01:43:15.530" style="s2">society let&#39;s say and they attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.429" end="01:43:18.459" style="s2">strike out on a better path and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.530" end="01:43:21.829" style="s2">all genuine it&#39;s like the idea as well</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.459" end="01:43:24.139" style="s2">if you don&#39;t allow people who make</p>
<p begin="01:43:21.829" end="01:43:25.550" style="s2">mistakes to move on then you just have</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.139" end="01:43:26.839" style="s2">to dispense with everyone because</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.550" end="01:43:28.459" style="s2">everyone&#39;s made mistakes</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.839" end="01:43:30.289" style="s2">now having said that I know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:28.459" end="01:43:35.619" style="s2">difference between categories of</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.289" end="01:43:42.489" style="s2">mistakes but you know forgiveness after</p>
<p begin="01:43:35.619" end="01:43:44.989" style="s2">repentance is a good moral axiom as a</p>
<p begin="01:43:42.489" end="01:43:46.609" style="s2">female I never had a great inclination</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.989" end="01:43:48.139" style="s2">to start a family after watching your</p>
<p begin="01:43:46.609" end="01:43:50.149" style="s2">material I&#39;m struggling with how much of</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.139" end="01:43:52.129" style="s2">that drive is my own brainwashing is my</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.149" end="01:43:55.510" style="s2">own versus brainwashing versus third</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.129" end="01:43:58.389" style="s2">wave feminists how do I parse that out</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.510" end="01:44:01.909" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.389" end="01:44:05.059" style="s2">how would you parse that out well I</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.909" end="01:44:06.739" style="s2">would I would start two things I would</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.059" end="01:44:08.780" style="s2">start by watching your dreams and your</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.739" end="01:44:11.119" style="s2">fantasies because they can tell you</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.780" end="01:44:12.949" style="s2">things that you first of all might not</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.119" end="01:44:15.499" style="s2">want to know but also that you that you</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.949" end="01:44:17.679" style="s2">don&#39;t know but I would also say try</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.499" end="01:44:19.510" style="s2">making a case for both sides</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.679" end="01:44:22.420" style="s2">you know like a really intelligent case</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.510" end="01:44:23.739" style="s2">so imagine that so you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.420" end="01:44:26.369" style="s2">figure this out so the first thing you</p>
<p begin="01:44:23.739" end="01:44:28.300" style="s2">do is formulate an argument where the</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.369" end="01:44:30.459" style="s2">proposition is that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.300" end="01:44:33.099" style="s2">brainwashed by third wave feminists and</p>
<p begin="01:44:30.459" end="01:44:36.130" style="s2">make the strongest possible argument you</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.099" end="01:44:38.170" style="s2">can in support of that and then put that</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.130" end="01:44:40.329" style="s2">aside and then do the reverse and make</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.170" end="01:44:44.079" style="s2">the strongest argument you possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.329" end="01:44:45.820" style="s2">in favor of the idea that you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.079" end="01:44:47.260" style="s2">this is your own idea and that for</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.820" end="01:44:49.030" style="s2">whatever reason you&#39;re not inclined to</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.260" end="01:44:50.789" style="s2">start a family you can even do the third</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.030" end="01:44:53.199" style="s2">thing which is to do another argument</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.789" end="01:44:55.869" style="s2">writing about why you should have a</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.199" end="01:44:57.999" style="s2">family and really like that&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.869" end="01:44:59.349" style="s2">right you got three arguments there you</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.999" end="01:45:01.539" style="s2">want to make each one of them as strong</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.349" end="01:45:04.360" style="s2">as you possibly can like really sweat</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.539" end="01:45:06.729" style="s2">over it and then what having made the</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.360" end="01:45:08.289" style="s2">arguments allow yourself to contemplate</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.729" end="01:45:09.969" style="s2">them for for as much time as you need</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.289" end="01:45:13.769" style="s2">and it&#39;ll start to become clear to you</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.969" end="01:45:16.150" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I would recommend so I</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.769" end="01:45:17.349" style="s2">follow your daughter&#39;s food blog where</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.150" end="01:45:18.639" style="s2">she has recently talked about her</p>

<p begin="01:45:46.030" end="01:45:52.119" style="s2">myself as a baby expert but once the kid</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.510" end="01:45:54.010" style="s2">is like nine months old and older than</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.119" end="01:45:55.719" style="s2">that especially between like 2 and 11</p>

<p begin="01:46:00.789" end="01:46:04.929" style="s2">wonderful and I lived long enough to</p>

<p begin="01:46:04.929" end="01:46:11.309" style="s2">I&#39;m not I&#39;m not 3/4 dead yet or anything</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.239" end="01:46:18.360" style="s2">like that and so hooray it&#39;s great and</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.309" end="01:46:18.360" style="s2">hopefully it&#39;ll happen some more so ok</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.250" end="01:46:23.789" style="s2">if dominance hierarchies select for</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.019" end="01:46:26.250" style="s2">heroes and breed them why then is Christ</p>
<p begin="01:46:23.789" end="01:46:34.619" style="s2">a celibate man isn&#39;t celibacy an excuse</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.250" end="01:46:36.000" style="s2">for cowardice that&#39;s a good one well the</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.619" end="01:46:37.860" style="s2">first thing that&#39;s kind of odd about</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.000" end="01:46:39.510" style="s2">Christ as an archetypal figure and this</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.860" end="01:46:41.489" style="s2">is something you&#39;ll commented on is he</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.510" end="01:46:45.360" style="s2">died pretty young he was only 32 you</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.489" end="01:46:48.360" style="s2">know so and young actually attributed</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.360" end="01:46:50.789" style="s2">the obsession in our culture with youth</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.360" end="01:46:52.829" style="s2">to the fact that our divine figure never</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.789" end="01:46:54.719" style="s2">became mature although you know we have</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.829" end="01:46:56.519" style="s2">the divine figure of God the Father</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.719" end="01:46:58.610" style="s2">which I suppose would fill out the</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.519" end="01:47:02.730" style="s2">archetype to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.610" end="01:47:07.159" style="s2">why is Christ a celibate man well I</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.730" end="01:47:07.159" style="s2">guess maybe you would say</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.850" end="01:47:17.930" style="s2">if you&#39;re in a situation where you can</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.980" end="01:47:20.690" style="s2">sacrifice yourself for the redemption of</p>
<p begin="01:47:17.930" end="01:47:22.790" style="s2">all of mankind may be adding the</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.690" end="01:47:24.890" style="s2">responsibility of an individual family</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.790" end="01:47:26.570" style="s2">to that is just a bit too much I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.890" end="01:47:27.920" style="s2">know that&#39;s a bit of a glib answer in</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.570" end="01:47:29.630" style="s2">some sense but there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.920" end="01:47:31.670" style="s2">it that&#39;s the case you know I mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.630" end="01:47:34.670" style="s2">earlier that now and then people have a</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.670" end="01:47:36.350" style="s2">calling of some sort that supersedes</p>
<p begin="01:47:34.670" end="01:47:39.220" style="s2">other callings that they could follow</p>
<p begin="01:47:36.350" end="01:47:41.150" style="s2">and I would say in the archetypal</p>

<p begin="01:47:41.150" end="01:47:48.800" style="s2">something that could definitely be that</p>
<p begin="01:47:44.660" end="01:47:50.690" style="s2">case could be made I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:48.800" end="01:47:53.630" style="s2">a sufficient answer though and I hope</p>

<p begin="01:47:55.610" end="01:47:58.640" style="s2">I get through the whole Bible if I can</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.140" end="01:48:00.830" style="s2">manage it now to probably take a couple</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.640" end="01:48:02.960" style="s2">of years that&#39;s the sort of question</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.830" end="01:48:05.300" style="s2">I&#39;ll be able to address more fully okay</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.960" end="01:48:12.230" style="s2">so let&#39;s go back to a live question here</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.300" end="01:48:13.700" style="s2">oh Zoltan Zoltar FTW have a BA in</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.230" end="01:48:15.590" style="s2">political science concentration</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.700" end="01:48:17.360" style="s2">political theory I&#39;m had any job offers</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.590" end="01:48:19.670" style="s2">and anything other than retail or all</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.360" end="01:48:22.820" style="s2">commissioned sales in over a year what</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.670" end="01:48:26.060" style="s2">should I be applying for well what I</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.820" end="01:48:28.460" style="s2">would say is take the best job you can</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.060" end="01:48:30.710" style="s2">find that could be retail and I know</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.460" end="01:48:32.630" style="s2">retail jobs can be pretty miserable but</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.710" end="01:48:34.550" style="s2">they may be better than no job at all if</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.630" end="01:48:36.350" style="s2">you have a job you&#39;re in a better</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.550" end="01:48:37.880" style="s2">position to find your next job because</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.350" end="01:48:39.590" style="s2">people would rather hire someone</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.880" end="01:48:41.930" style="s2">employed that someone who isn&#39;t employed</p>
<p begin="01:48:39.590" end="01:48:43.190" style="s2">and and then you&#39;re also employed you</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.930" end="01:48:44.780" style="s2">have some structure in your life and</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.190" end="01:48:47.510" style="s2">then I would also say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.780" end="01:48:50.270" style="s2">underestimate the possibility of moving</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.510" end="01:48:52.550" style="s2">up in a retail job know you can if</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.270" end="01:48:54.050" style="s2">you&#39;re smart and hard-working and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:52.550" end="01:48:55.640" style="s2">with a company that&#39;s smart enough to</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.050" end="01:48:58.340" style="s2">bloody well recognize someone like that</p>
<p begin="01:48:55.640" end="01:48:59.540" style="s2">the probability for advancement in that</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.340" end="01:49:01.730" style="s2">kind of corporate structure can be</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.540" end="01:49:03.620" style="s2">really great and so I would say if</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.730" end="01:49:05.360" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take a retail job take</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.620" end="01:49:09.790" style="s2">the damn thing seriously and don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.360" end="01:49:12.140" style="s2">like it&#39;s beneath you because every</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.790" end="01:49:14.540" style="s2">circumstance that you find yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.140" end="01:49:17.390" style="s2">as a human being is rich enough so that</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.540" end="01:49:22.190" style="s2">there&#39;s much that you can bring to it in</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.390" end="01:49:24.350" style="s2">terms of of useful commitment you know</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.190" end="01:49:25.610" style="s2">like in a retail job well you have the</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.350" end="01:49:26.630" style="s2">opportunity to learn how to interact</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.610" end="01:49:29.599" style="s2">with customers</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.630" end="01:49:31.880" style="s2">you have the opportunity to sell you</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.599" end="01:49:33.860" style="s2">these are big bloody skills if you can</p>
<p begin="01:49:31.880" end="01:49:35.269" style="s2">get them right you know you have the</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.860" end="01:49:36.829" style="s2">opportunity to learn how to be grateful</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.269" end="01:49:40.369" style="s2">that you&#39;re not starving to death in a</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.829" end="01:49:42.139" style="s2">ditch you know and and it&#39;s not such a</p>
<p begin="01:49:40.369" end="01:49:43.639" style="s2">bad thing to start at the bottom because</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.139" end="01:49:45.559" style="s2">then you learn what the bottom is like</p>
<p begin="01:49:43.639" end="01:49:47.539" style="s2">and you learn how to move forward so I</p>
<p begin="01:49:45.559" end="01:49:50.630" style="s2">would say take the best job you can find</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.539" end="01:49:53.599" style="s2">and then continue to look for other jobs</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.630" end="01:49:55.820" style="s2">but but do the job right do it properly</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.599" end="01:50:00.469" style="s2">and one of the things and I&#39;ve had lots</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.820" end="01:50:02.749" style="s2">of what would you say I don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.469" end="01:50:05.300" style="s2">call them low-end jobs but they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.749" end="01:50:06.829" style="s2">they&#39;re there working class jobs I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.300" end="01:50:10.599" style="s2">had lots of working class jobs in my</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.829" end="01:50:13.849" style="s2">life like a dozens of them really and</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.599" end="01:50:16.789" style="s2">they&#39;re not trivial you can learn a lot</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.849" end="01:50:18.019" style="s2">in a working class job and you know you</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.789" end="01:50:20.239" style="s2">can learn how to get along with your</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.019" end="01:50:22.369" style="s2">employer with your peers you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:50:20.239" end="01:50:24.559" style="s2">how to get along with your supervisors</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.369" end="01:50:25.880" style="s2">and be useful to them and maybe be drawn</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.559" end="01:50:27.769" style="s2">to their attention if they have any</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.880" end="01:50:29.780" style="s2">sense and I mean if you have a retail</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.769" end="01:50:31.820" style="s2">job and it&#39;s they&#39;re treating you like a</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.780" end="01:50:33.469" style="s2">miserable slave and if you&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.820" end="01:50:34.550" style="s2">good job and you get no credit for it</p>
<p begin="01:50:33.469" end="01:50:36.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like get the hell out of there as</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.550" end="01:50:38.899" style="s2">fast as you can but you want to find</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.559" end="01:50:40.399" style="s2">somewhere where if you work hard and</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.899" end="01:50:41.719" style="s2">you&#39;re a reasonable person that people</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.399" end="01:50:43.760" style="s2">are going to notice that and open up</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.719" end="01:50:45.409" style="s2">doors of opportunity for you that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.760" end="01:50:47.630" style="s2">of the definition of a healthy company</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.409" end="01:50:49.459" style="s2">and you can find that virtually anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.630" end="01:50:51.139" style="s2">so don&#39;t be thinking that the retail</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.459" end="01:50:53.300" style="s2">jobs are necessarily you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.139" end="01:50:56.090" style="s2">be there forever you know and with a BA</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.300" end="01:50:57.380" style="s2">you often have to start at the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.090" end="01:51:00.289" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.380" end="01:51:02.719" style="s2">you&#39;re going to end up so so don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.289" end="01:51:05.360" style="s2">feel too dismal about that it it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:51:02.719" end="01:51:06.889" style="s2">start man and that&#39;s something and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.360" end="01:51:08.209" style="s2">could go into the retail job and you</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.889" end="01:51:09.590" style="s2">could think okay like if I was really</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.209" end="01:51:11.209" style="s2">smart about this and I was really</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.590" end="01:51:13.090" style="s2">regarding this as an opportunity how</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.209" end="01:51:15.409" style="s2">could I knock this out of the park and</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.090" end="01:51:16.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to think about and</p>
<p begin="01:51:15.409" end="01:51:18.800" style="s2">it beats the hell out of you know</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.760" end="01:51:20.179" style="s2">sitting there and I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:51:18.800" end="01:51:22.070" style="s2">you&#39;re necessarily doing this but</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.179" end="01:51:23.749" style="s2">feeling sorry for yourself because you</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.070" end="01:51:26.059" style="s2">know you&#39;ve got a degree in the world</p>
<p begin="01:51:23.749" end="01:51:28.999" style="s2">isn&#39;t opening itself up to you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.059" end="01:51:32.329" style="s2">maybe it is maybe the retail job is</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.999" end="01:51:34.070" style="s2">opening itself up to you so and then you</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.329" end="01:51:35.959" style="s2">work hard on developing your career once</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.070" end="01:51:38.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a toehold in there and I know</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.959" end="01:51:39.310" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe you might regard that as</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.030" end="01:51:41.770" style="s2">naively optimist</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.310" end="01:51:44.260" style="s2">but that beats naively pessimistic and I</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.770" end="01:51:49.060" style="s2">but I also do believe and I&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.260" end="01:51:52.030" style="s2">happen many times is that you can if if</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.060" end="01:51:54.880" style="s2">your attitude is if you have yourself</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.030" end="01:51:57.310" style="s2">put together properly let&#39;s say sorted</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.880" end="01:51:59.620" style="s2">out properly you can make a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.310" end="01:52:02.140" style="s2">positive impact on the world in a</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.620" end="01:52:03.760" style="s2">relatively low-level position you know</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.140" end="01:52:05.770" style="s2">because you could make the person who</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.760" end="01:52:07.960" style="s2">walks into the store your retail</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.770" end="01:52:09.490" style="s2">operation you could make the next 10</p>
<p begin="01:52:07.960" end="01:52:11.080" style="s2">minutes of their life a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:52:09.490" end="01:52:13.090" style="s2">more pleasant than they might be if you</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.080" end="01:52:14.530" style="s2">were miserable and resentful and you</p>
<p begin="01:52:13.090" end="01:52:16.060" style="s2">know maybe they&#39;ll come back again and</p>
<p begin="01:52:14.530" end="01:52:17.680" style="s2">maybe the store will thrive that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:16.060" end="01:52:19.330" style="s2">especially true if you start working for</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.680" end="01:52:21.790" style="s2">a smaller businessman you can have a big</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.330" end="01:52:22.840" style="s2">effect on a small business so don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:52:21.790" end="01:52:24.730" style="s2">thinking that there&#39;s no opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.840" end="01:52:26.230" style="s2">there you know it might be your</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.730" end="01:52:27.970" style="s2">inability to construe that as</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.230" end="01:52:30.070" style="s2">opportunity that&#39;s the that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:52:27.970" end="01:52:34.420" style="s2">interfering with it believe me I know</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.070" end="01:52:36.570" style="s2">that especially chain retail jobs and</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.420" end="01:52:38.590" style="s2">especially if you have a dismal</p>
<p begin="01:52:36.570" end="01:52:41.500" style="s2">authoritarian manager that those jobs</p>
<p begin="01:52:38.590" end="01:52:44.020" style="s2">can just be hell but so I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.500" end="01:52:45.940" style="s2">recommend staying in a job that&#39;s hell</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.020" end="01:52:47.530" style="s2">and that where there&#39;s no further</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.940" end="01:52:49.210" style="s2">movement but don&#39;t necessarily think</p>
<p begin="01:52:47.530" end="01:52:51.070" style="s2">that you&#39;re not being an offer offered</p>
<p begin="01:52:49.210" end="01:52:52.810" style="s2">an opportunity if you can take any job</p>
<p begin="01:52:51.070" end="01:52:55.720" style="s2">at all you got to start somewhere man</p>
<p begin="01:52:52.810" end="01:52:56.890" style="s2">and and and the bottom like I said the</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.720" end="01:52:59.200" style="s2">bottom is not a bad place to start</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.890" end="01:53:00.910" style="s2">because you learn down there and someone</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.200" end="01:53:04.300" style="s2">who gets really good at business across</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.910" end="01:53:06.610" style="s2">time let&#39;s say knows whatever enterprise</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.300" end="01:53:08.890" style="s2">they&#39;re in from the bottom up and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.610" end="01:53:10.780" style="s2">what makes them competent so and they</p>
<p begin="01:53:08.890" end="01:53:11.980" style="s2">don&#39;t say oh well the things that the</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.780" end="01:53:14.110" style="s2">bottom are too</p>
<p begin="01:53:11.980" end="01:53:16.060" style="s2">they&#39;re not good enough for me because</p>
<p begin="01:53:14.110" end="01:53:17.860" style="s2">the things at the bottom are really what</p>
<p begin="01:53:16.060" end="01:53:19.720" style="s2">the business rests on and you need to</p>
<p begin="01:53:17.860" end="01:53:21.250" style="s2">know how those things work and then you</p>

<p begin="01:53:33.490" end="01:53:38.860" style="s2">902 and we started at 7:30 let&#39;s go to</p>
<p begin="01:53:36.760" end="01:53:42.210" style="s2">9:30 that&#39;s probably good enough so</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.860" end="01:53:42.210" style="s2">that&#39;s about 20 more minutes um</p>

<p begin="01:53:50.389" end="01:53:59.210" style="s2">years and I still believe she&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:53:52.960" end="01:54:01.309" style="s2">well I would say she&#39;s a 1 and look some</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.210" end="01:54:04.429" style="s2">people really pair-bond hard you know to</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.309" end="01:54:06.889" style="s2">put it in in crass biological terms but</p>
<p begin="01:54:04.429" end="01:54:11.239" style="s2">if she&#39;s moved on and that&#39;s serious you</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.889" end="01:54:13.400" style="s2">know then I would say start start going</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.239" end="01:54:17.420" style="s2">out with other people you know really</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.400" end="01:54:19.070" style="s2">and and start just because she&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.420" end="01:54:24.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean she&#39;s the only</p>

<p begin="01:54:29.780" end="01:54:33.139" style="s2">over it and if you&#39;re having real</p>
<p begin="01:54:31.489" end="01:54:34.670" style="s2">trouble with that then I think you</p>
<p begin="01:54:33.139" end="01:54:36.619" style="s2">should probably find someone to talk to</p>
<p begin="01:54:34.670" end="01:54:38.269" style="s2">and talk that out and figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.619" end="01:54:42.170" style="s2">your strategy is but I would say get the</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.269" end="01:54:43.460" style="s2">hell back into life man now if you know</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.170" end="01:54:45.320" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s part of you that still</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.460" end="01:54:48.199" style="s2">thinks that there&#39;s some possibility of</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.320" end="01:54:50.030" style="s2">rekindling the relationship and for all</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.199" end="01:54:52.070" style="s2">I know maybe that&#39;s possible it seems</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.030" end="01:54:55.489" style="s2">unlikely because I don&#39;t think that you</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.070" end="01:54:57.050" style="s2">would I don&#39;t think that you would be</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.489" end="01:55:00.139" style="s2">asking that question if you thought that</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.050" end="01:55:02.989" style="s2">was a possibility but I would say um go</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.139" end="01:55:05.690" style="s2">and go find some other people man and</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.989" end="01:55:07.010" style="s2">and and admit to the possibility that</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.690" end="01:55:11.059" style="s2">there might be someone else out there</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.010" end="01:55:12.530" style="s2">that will work with you and get on with</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.059" end="01:55:14.329" style="s2">your life because you&#39;re going to be old</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.530" end="01:55:16.730" style="s2">a lot faster than you think and you</p>
<p begin="01:55:14.329" end="01:55:18.260" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be stuck in stasis any</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.730" end="01:55:20.090" style="s2">longer than necessary because then</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.260" end="01:55:23.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve lost the woman and you&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.090" end="01:55:25.190" style="s2">your time and losing the woman is bad</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.750" end="01:55:29.739" style="s2">enough but losing the woman and your</p>
<p begin="01:55:25.190" end="01:55:29.739" style="s2">time that&#39;s really not good at all so</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.789" end="01:55:35.539" style="s2">let&#39;s see how do you get over hiding</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.460" end="01:55:37.039" style="s2">something because of the fear that</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.539" end="01:55:38.750" style="s2">people will think of you differently or</p>
<p begin="01:55:37.039" end="01:55:41.500" style="s2">treat you worse especially for family</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.750" end="01:55:47.210" style="s2">members and others close to you</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.500" end="01:55:48.739" style="s2">Quentin Goodwin you know Quentin I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.210" end="01:55:50.539" style="s2">know what&#39;s say about that because it</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.739" end="01:55:55.269" style="s2">depends on what your it depends on what</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.539" end="01:55:55.269" style="s2">you&#39;re hiding you know so</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.559" end="01:56:00.979" style="s2">I&#39;d like to answer that question but</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.909" end="01:56:02.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not detailed enough the devil with</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.979" end="01:56:04.789" style="s2">questions like that man the devil is</p>
<p begin="01:56:02.780" end="01:56:08.599" style="s2">often really seriously in the details</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.789" end="01:56:10.340" style="s2">and I just if you think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.599" end="01:56:11.869" style="s2">hiding it because of cowardice that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.340" end="01:56:13.039" style="s2">one thing but like you might have a real</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.869" end="01:56:14.599" style="s2">problem you know and you&#39;re hiding</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.039" end="01:56:17.329" style="s2">something that really would cause</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.599" end="01:56:19.130" style="s2">serious repercussions in your social</p>
<p begin="01:56:17.329" end="01:56:20.389" style="s2">circumstances and in your family in</p>
<p begin="01:56:19.130" end="01:56:22.099" style="s2">which case you know it&#39;s a hell of a</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.389" end="01:56:23.719" style="s2">tough thing to deal with them I would</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.099" end="01:56:25.429" style="s2">say you need to find someone that you</p>
<p begin="01:56:23.719" end="01:56:27.439" style="s2">can talk to that you trust that&#39;s wise</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.429" end="01:56:31.689" style="s2">and maybe that would be a professional</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.439" end="01:56:34.039" style="s2">but or I would say the same thing that I</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.689" end="01:56:35.809" style="s2">mentioned earlier to to someone who had</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.039" end="01:56:38.989" style="s2">a similar question about strategy is</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.809" end="01:56:40.280" style="s2">like write down a strategy and then the</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.989" end="01:56:44.119" style="s2">other thing you could do to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.280" end="01:56:45.650" style="s2">useful is imagine the worst okay imagine</p>
<p begin="01:56:44.119" end="01:56:46.969" style="s2">you reveal whatever this is and the</p>
<p begin="01:56:45.650" end="01:56:50.150" style="s2">worst happens</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.969" end="01:56:52.479" style="s2">lay out the worst so you understand it</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.150" end="01:56:55.969" style="s2">you know be be realistic about it and</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.479" end="01:56:57.499" style="s2">then figure out how you&#39;d handle it you</p>
<p begin="01:56:55.969" end="01:56:59.389" style="s2">know like you could imagine well</p>
<p begin="01:56:57.499" end="01:57:02.809" style="s2">everyone now hates me so much I have to</p>
<p begin="01:56:59.389" end="01:57:04.939" style="s2">move to a new town well maybe you could</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.809" end="01:57:06.739" style="s2">do that you know and once you know that</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.939" end="01:57:08.090" style="s2">you could do that then maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:57:06.739" end="01:57:10.789" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be so afraid about it</p>
<p begin="01:57:08.090" end="01:57:12.409" style="s2">so it&#39;s often the case that people are</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.789" end="01:57:13.579" style="s2">terrified about the terrible things that</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.409" end="01:57:15.769" style="s2">might happen is because they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.579" end="01:57:18.400" style="s2">really think through what the terrible</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.769" end="01:57:20.809" style="s2">things are and what they would do and so</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.400" end="01:57:22.639" style="s2">think it through think the catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.809" end="01:57:24.050" style="s2">through and think about how you would</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.639" end="01:57:26.889" style="s2">cope with it if it happened and that</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.050" end="01:57:29.150" style="s2">should encourage you to some degree so</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.889" end="01:57:30.349" style="s2">Benjamin would question what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.150" end="01:57:32.659" style="s2">with Maslow&#39;s hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.349" end="01:57:34.159" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with Maslow&#39;s hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.659" end="01:57:36.530" style="s2">my I was just writing about that</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.159" end="01:57:40.820" style="s2">yesterday day before and in my new book</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.530" end="01:57:42.499" style="s2">by the way Maslow presumes that you have</p>
<p begin="01:57:40.820" end="01:57:43.909" style="s2">to meet your material needs before you</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.499" end="01:57:46.249" style="s2">can meet your spiritual needs and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.909" end="01:57:50.780" style="s2">wrong that&#39;s just not right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.249" end="01:57:51.949" style="s2">wise and I would say the read Victor</p>
<p begin="01:57:50.780" end="01:57:54.530" style="s2">Frankel&#39;s man&#39;s search for meaning</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.949" end="01:57:56.719" style="s2">that&#39;s a good antidote to that and also</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.530" end="01:57:58.489" style="s2">again I would say read social net since</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.719" end="01:58:01.489" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago especially following</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.489" end="01:58:05.360" style="s2">him too because Solzhenitsyn has done a</p>
<p begin="01:58:01.489" end="01:58:07.660" style="s2">tremendous job of dispelling the idea</p>
<p begin="01:58:05.360" end="01:58:09.820" style="s2">that material security and</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.660" end="01:58:12.640" style="s2">and comfort is a prerequisite to</p>

<p begin="01:58:12.640" end="01:58:20.020" style="s2">being so so I think what&#39;s wrong with</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.770" end="01:58:23.140" style="s2">Maslow&#39;s hierarchy the idea of Maslow&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:20.020" end="01:58:25.270" style="s2">hierarchy is that it&#39;s far too</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.140" end="01:58:27.610" style="s2">materialistic in its fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.270" end="01:58:28.870" style="s2">orientation now having said that you</p>
<p begin="01:58:27.610" end="01:58:30.610" style="s2">know that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.870" end="01:58:33.250" style="s2">nothing useful in Maslow&#39;s thinking I</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.610" end="01:58:35.140" style="s2">think that his discussions of self</p>
<p begin="01:58:33.250" end="01:58:37.720" style="s2">actualized persons are actually very</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.140" end="01:58:39.910" style="s2">interesting and the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.720" end="01:58:41.470" style="s2">there are higher levels of human human</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.910" end="01:58:43.570" style="s2">psychological and spiritual development</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.470" end="01:58:44.230" style="s2">I and he was thinking about more</p>

<p begin="01:58:44.230" end="01:58:49.390" style="s2">I think is also extremely useful but I</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.420" end="01:58:51.130" style="s2">think the idea of the manner in which</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.390" end="01:58:53.740" style="s2">you progress through the hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.130" end="01:58:56.530" style="s2">wrong I also think it&#39;s a socialist idea</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.740" end="01:58:58.270" style="s2">in some sense because the an a utopian</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.530" end="01:58:59.800" style="s2">idea because the idea is the way that</p>

<p begin="02:00:11.740" end="02:00:15.160" style="s2">she wanted to expose me to that</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.300" end="02:00:16.960" style="s2">philosophy and like I found in rands</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.160" end="02:00:19.900" style="s2">books I really liked reading them</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.960" end="02:00:21.490" style="s2">they&#39;re really romantic they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="02:00:19.900" end="02:00:23.590" style="s2">they&#39;re interesting adventure</p>
<p begin="02:00:21.490" end="02:00:25.660" style="s2">stories I would say and you know ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.590" end="02:00:27.460" style="s2">Rand had a point I mean she had a hell</p>

<p begin="02:00:29.350" end="02:00:32.830" style="s2">had reasons for doing what she was doing</p>
<p begin="02:00:30.730" end="02:00:35.860" style="s2">but the problem with Ain Rand as a</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.830" end="02:00:37.900" style="s2">literary figure is that all her heroes</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.860" end="02:00:40.600" style="s2">are the same people and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.900" end="02:00:43.300" style="s2">completely heroic and all her villains</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.600" end="02:00:45.190" style="s2">are the same people the same person just</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.300" end="02:00:48.160" style="s2">in different bodies and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.190" end="02:00:50.260" style="s2">almost completely reprehensible and so</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.160" end="02:00:53.350" style="s2">you know one of the hallmarks of high</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.260" end="02:00:56.020" style="s2">quality literature is that the battle</p>
<p begin="02:00:53.350" end="02:00:58.390" style="s2">between good and evil isn&#39;t just fought</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.020" end="02:01:01.300" style="s2">out between the good guys and the bad</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.390" end="02:01:03.430" style="s2">guys like at a cultural level that would</p>
<p begin="02:01:01.300" end="02:01:06.520" style="s2">be an identity politics issue safe and</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.430" end="02:01:08.380" style="s2">that it&#39;s not the good guy as an</p>

<p begin="02:01:08.380" end="02:01:13.450" style="s2">in a tram that would be the capitalist</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.050" end="02:01:16.450" style="s2">Messiah and then the evil reprehensible</p>
<p begin="02:01:13.450" end="02:01:18.100" style="s2">satanic figure and you know all of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:16.450" end="02:01:20.050" style="s2">good traits are embodied in one and all</p>
<p begin="02:01:18.100" end="02:01:22.120" style="s2">of the bad traits in the other in in</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.050" end="02:01:24.730" style="s2">really sophisticated literature I would</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.120" end="02:01:26.890" style="s2">say that even the villains have good</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.730" end="02:01:28.470" style="s2">qualities like villains are way more</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.890" end="02:01:32.230" style="s2">interesting when they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.470" end="02:01:33.970" style="s2">interestingly good and you know</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.230" end="02:01:35.650" style="s2">Raskolnikov in in crime and punishment</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.970" end="02:01:37.270" style="s2">is a good example of that in all of</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.650" end="02:01:39.940" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s villains for that matter</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.270" end="02:01:42.070" style="s2">because they have deeply admirable</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.940" end="02:01:44.590" style="s2">qualities like Ivan for example it was</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.070" end="02:01:47.260" style="s2">not exactly a villain but but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.590" end="02:01:49.810" style="s2">certainly atheistic which would put him</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.260" end="02:01:51.820" style="s2">at odds with Dostoevsky in The Brothers</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.810" end="02:01:53.230" style="s2">Karamazov I mean Ivan has everything</p>
<p begin="02:01:51.820" end="02:01:55.180" style="s2">going for him he&#39;s good-looking he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.230" end="02:01:57.730" style="s2">dashing he&#39;s young he&#39;s brave he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.180" end="02:02:02.290" style="s2">he&#39;s got military training like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:57.730" end="02:02:05.080" style="s2">he&#39;s uh he&#39;s he&#39;s clear-headed he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:02:02.290" end="02:02:08.440" style="s2">hell of a villain he&#39;s a great villain</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.080" end="02:02:12.280" style="s2">man and Ian Rand it&#39;s just like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.440" end="02:02:14.140" style="s2">just too formulaic in my estimation and</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.280" end="02:02:16.030" style="s2">so it starts to verge on the ideological</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.140" end="02:02:18.160" style="s2">and she was primarily motivated by</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.030" end="02:02:20.290" style="s2">making a political point rather than by</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.160" end="02:02:23.110" style="s2">writing literature in my estimation so</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.290" end="02:02:24.700" style="s2">that&#39;s all I mean and having said that I</p>
<p begin="02:02:23.110" end="02:02:27.490" style="s2">would also say I got a great pleasure in</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.700" end="02:02:30.040" style="s2">reading in Brad&#39;s book so I&#39;m not I</p>
<p begin="02:02:27.490" end="02:02:32.290" style="s2">don&#39;t precisely disapprove of her she</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.040" end="02:02:34.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t she just isn&#39;t a top-rate</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.290" end="02:02:37.180" style="s2">philosopher and she&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.600" end="02:02:39.370" style="s2">top-rate literary figure and those are</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.180" end="02:02:42.430" style="s2">the reasons she&#39;s a little bit too</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.370" end="02:02:48.060" style="s2">propagandistic and her characters are</p>
<p begin="02:02:42.430" end="02:02:51.640" style="s2">too uni dimensional so yep that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.060" end="02:02:53.500" style="s2">okay let&#39;s see here fresh sweet says</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.640" end="02:02:57.910" style="s2">Jordan is a mental [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.500" end="02:02:59.620" style="s2">well I&#39;m tall so at least I&#39;m also I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:02:57.910" end="02:03:04.540" style="s2">got some elements of me that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.620" end="02:03:07.330" style="s2">entirely [ __ ] like so let&#39;s see so</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.540" end="02:03:10.060" style="s2">what else do I say about that well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.330" end="02:03:13.330" style="s2">conceivable that fresh sweet is a mental</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.060" end="02:03:15.850" style="s2">giant by comparison but I doubt if he or</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.330" end="02:03:19.470" style="s2">she would have used that insult if that</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.850" end="02:03:23.590" style="s2">happened to be the case so let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="02:03:19.470" end="02:03:29.550" style="s2">someone said please can I say their name</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.590" end="02:03:29.550" style="s2">and the answer that is no because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.640" end="02:03:34.870" style="s2">lost your question so I read your</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.310" end="02:03:37.390" style="s2">question but I&#39;m not going to say your</p>
<p begin="02:03:34.870" end="02:03:39.880" style="s2">name so well that&#39;s that&#39;s ironic I</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.390" end="02:03:43.560" style="s2">suppose Oh sharp girl seeks are there</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.880" end="02:03:43.560" style="s2">evil persons with no redeeming qualities</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.190" end="02:03:50.850" style="s2">no that would be just too simple man</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.360" end="02:03:54.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;d be nice if that was the case</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.800" end="02:03:56.830" style="s2">you know you know what I mean not</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.970" end="02:04:00.040" style="s2">exactly nice but know that it just isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:03:56.830" end="02:04:01.690" style="s2">how life works man it&#39;s it&#39;s as social</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.040" end="02:04:03.910" style="s2">medicine said you know even in the best</p>
<p begin="02:04:01.690" end="02:04:06.310" style="s2">person there&#39;s still some uprooted an</p>
<p begin="02:04:03.910" end="02:04:08.740" style="s2">uprooted corner of evil and even in the</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.310" end="02:04:10.960" style="s2">person who&#39;s gone as far down the rabbit</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.740" end="02:04:14.260" style="s2">hole as you can possibly go there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.960" end="02:04:16.120" style="s2">still shining element of the divine</p>
<p begin="02:04:14.260" end="02:04:19.240" style="s2">quality of humanity that could be</p>

<p begin="02:12:44.940" end="02:12:49.530" style="s2">and then they get into it they think wow</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.880" end="02:12:51.030" style="s2">this is going really good so they study</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.530" end="02:12:52.710" style="s2">for two hours and then they&#39;ve broken</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.030" end="02:12:54.510" style="s2">the contract with themselves and they</p>
<p begin="02:12:52.710" end="02:12:56.580" style="s2">don&#39;t trust themselves anymore and then</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.510" end="02:13:00.120" style="s2">they don&#39;t study for a whole year or</p>
<p begin="02:12:56.580" end="02:13:03.950" style="s2">well maybe not for a month so but set</p>
<p begin="02:13:00.120" end="02:13:07.140" style="s2">your contract ask yourself you know what</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.950" end="02:13:10.350" style="s2">could I do to move myself forward to my</p>
<p begin="02:13:07.140" end="02:13:12.510" style="s2">goal that I would do and then how could</p>
<p begin="02:13:10.350" end="02:13:14.850" style="s2">I improve that incrementally so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:12.510" end="02:13:19.830" style="s2">the right way of going about that so</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.850" end="02:13:21.660" style="s2">okay what do you think about the line</p>
<p begin="02:13:19.830" end="02:13:23.930" style="s2">that&#39;s often fed to young people to do</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.660" end="02:13:27.590" style="s2">what you love and follow your dreams</p>
<p begin="02:13:23.930" end="02:13:27.590" style="s2">well you know</p>
<p begin="02:13:39.389" end="02:13:43.380" style="s2">there&#39;s something to be said for doing</p>
<p begin="02:13:41.280" end="02:13:46.050" style="s2">what grips you but you know you have to</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.380" end="02:13:48.570" style="s2">ally that with discipline that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:13:46.050" end="02:13:52.050" style="s2">thing and you have to ally it with</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.570" end="02:13:54.239" style="s2">responsibility and so and and I would</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.050" end="02:13:56.489" style="s2">also say that that advice say which</p>
<p begin="02:13:54.239" end="02:13:58.320" style="s2">which I think has been most popularly</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.489" end="02:14:00.270" style="s2">associated with Joseph Campbell was</p>
<p begin="02:13:58.320" end="02:14:03.150" style="s2">actually to some degree something that</p>
<p begin="02:14:00.270" end="02:14:04.770" style="s2">was at least initiated by young but one</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.150" end="02:14:08.369" style="s2">of the things you said was more like</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.770" end="02:14:09.989" style="s2">follow what grips and compels you and it</p>
<p begin="02:14:08.369" end="02:14:11.730" style="s2">will take you into the underworld where</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.989" end="02:14:15.449" style="s2">you will encounter your shadow and the</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.730" end="02:14:19.350" style="s2">dragon and and when you put it that way</p>
<p begin="02:14:15.449" end="02:14:25.380" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more realistic it it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.350" end="02:14:27.690" style="s2">just too naive and and and and too good</p>
<p begin="02:14:25.380" end="02:14:29.850" style="s2">to be true to be a good doctrine</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.690" end="02:14:31.739" style="s2">although I think there&#39;s some there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:14:29.850" end="02:14:35.690" style="s2">element of truth in it you do want to</p>
<p begin="02:14:31.739" end="02:14:38.940" style="s2">follow your dreams but not if your dream</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.690" end="02:14:40.739" style="s2">changes every 30 seconds you know like</p>
<p begin="02:14:38.940" end="02:14:42.420" style="s2">with the Future authoring program one of</p>
<p begin="02:14:40.739" end="02:14:46.050" style="s2">the things we get people to do is to</p>
<p begin="02:14:42.420" end="02:14:47.940" style="s2">detail out a vision for the future if</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.050" end="02:14:49.650" style="s2">you could have the future that you</p>
<p begin="02:14:47.940" end="02:14:51.719" style="s2">dreamed of having what would what would</p>
<p begin="02:14:49.650" end="02:14:53.489" style="s2">that dream be that&#39;s really useful but</p>
<p begin="02:14:51.719" end="02:14:56.760" style="s2">then the next part of the exercise is</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.489" end="02:14:59.369" style="s2">okay how are you going to do the hard</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.760" end="02:15:01.020" style="s2">discipline multi-year work necessarily</p>
<p begin="02:14:59.369" end="02:15:02.580" style="s2">necessary to bring that dream into</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.020" end="02:15:05.580" style="s2">reality and how are you going to make</p>
<p begin="02:15:02.580" end="02:15:10.469" style="s2">that realistic and implementable on a</p>
<p begin="02:15:05.580" end="02:15:13.739" style="s2">day to day on a day to day on a day to</p>
<p begin="02:15:10.469" end="02:15:17.250" style="s2">day level so you got to bring your dream</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.739" end="02:15:18.810" style="s2">down to earth man and and and act it out</p>
<p begin="02:15:17.250" end="02:15:20.699" style="s2">and you have to be disciplined to do</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.810" end="02:15:24.000" style="s2">that and so that&#39;s that&#39;s the part</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.699" end="02:15:26.940" style="s2">that&#39;s missing there is do what you love</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.000" end="02:15:28.590" style="s2">and discipline yourself that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.940" end="02:15:30.150" style="s2">combination that&#39;s a good combination</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.590" end="02:15:31.800" style="s2">what are your thoughts on sleep</p>
<p begin="02:15:30.150" end="02:15:37.590" style="s2">paralysis that happens to me all the</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.800" end="02:15:39.119" style="s2">time so it exists I mean it I often have</p>
<p begin="02:15:37.590" end="02:15:43.830" style="s2">it happened to me this weekend for</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.119" end="02:15:46.469" style="s2">example it&#39;s quite it&#39;s quite comical so</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.830" end="02:15:48.570" style="s2">if I go to sleep on my back sometimes I</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.469" end="02:15:51.060" style="s2">will dream that I&#39;m trying to wake up</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.570" end="02:15:52.920" style="s2">but I can&#39;t and so I am trying to wake</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.060" end="02:15:54.929" style="s2">up but I&#39;m asleep and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:15:52.920" end="02:15:56.400" style="s2">still paralyzed because you get</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.929" end="02:15:58.080" style="s2">paralyzed when your REM sleep so you</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.400" end="02:15:59.640" style="s2">don&#39;t run around and act out your dreams</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.080" end="02:16:01.620" style="s2">and smash your nose into a wall like</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.640" end="02:16:04.699" style="s2">cats do if you take that part of their</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.620" end="02:16:10.140" style="s2">brain out and so I often dream that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.699" end="02:16:12.570" style="s2">kind of semi comatose and I know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.140" end="02:16:17.100" style="s2">wake up and I&#39;m like grabbing out my</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.570" end="02:16:18.840" style="s2">daughter&#39;s sleeve too and saying throw</p>
<p begin="02:16:17.100" end="02:16:20.190" style="s2">cold water on me or shake me or</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.840" end="02:16:21.750" style="s2">something or push me out of bed because</p>
<p begin="02:16:20.190" end="02:16:23.250" style="s2">I can&#39;t wake up and then she&#39;ll ignore</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.750" end="02:16:24.750" style="s2">me and then I&#39;ll try to get my wife to</p>
<p begin="02:16:23.250" end="02:16:26.969" style="s2">do it in my dream and it like it seems</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.750" end="02:16:28.890" style="s2">like it lasts an hour and then finally</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.969" end="02:16:30.960" style="s2">I&#39;ll shake myself awake and I often end</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.890" end="02:16:32.639" style="s2">up haha when I wake up like that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.960" end="02:16:34.110" style="s2">often annoyed because I&#39;ve been telling</p>
<p begin="02:16:32.639" end="02:16:35.400" style="s2">my family members as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:16:34.110" end="02:16:37.050" style="s2">concerned for like half an hour</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.400" end="02:16:39.330" style="s2">desperately to wake me up and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.050" end="02:16:40.800" style="s2">been ignoring me of course it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="02:16:39.330" end="02:16:43.410" style="s2">only taken five minutes and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.800" end="02:16:45.689" style="s2">have any idea what&#39;s going on but it</p>
<p begin="02:16:43.410" end="02:16:48.150" style="s2">often I think it has something to do</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.689" end="02:16:49.860" style="s2">with serotonergic malfunction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.150" end="02:16:52.050" style="s2">that might be related to this mood</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.860" end="02:16:54.030" style="s2">disorder that I described but but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:52.050" end="02:16:56.040" style="s2">also much more likely to occur if you</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.030" end="02:16:57.599" style="s2">lay on your back and sleep on your back</p>
<p begin="02:16:56.040" end="02:17:00.630" style="s2">and also if you do it in the afternoon</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.599" end="02:17:02.550" style="s2">so and people can have quite horrifying</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.630" end="02:17:05.010" style="s2">experiences with sleep paralysis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.550" end="02:17:07.979" style="s2">a good book called the the terror that</p>
<p begin="02:17:05.010" end="02:17:10.830" style="s2">comes in the night about sleep paralysis</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.979" end="02:17:12.420" style="s2">and nightmares and it&#39;s quite an</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.830" end="02:17:17.189" style="s2">interesting investigation into that</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.420" end="02:17:19.229" style="s2">phenomena so oh your essay writing</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.189" end="02:17:21.330" style="s2">guidance has proven invaluable well</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.229" end="02:17:23.670" style="s2">thank you that refers to that thing that</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.330" end="02:17:26.700" style="s2">that writing exercise that you can find</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.670" end="02:17:29.189" style="s2">on my cycle psychology 430 website I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.700" end="02:17:31.650" style="s2">trying to find a better place to put it</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.189" end="02:17:33.360" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll tweet about it again I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.650" end="02:17:34.679" style="s2">it&#39;s invaluable it&#39;s taken a long time</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.360" end="02:17:36.059" style="s2">to figure out how to write it do you</p>
<p begin="02:17:34.679" end="02:17:37.590" style="s2">have any guidance around taking notes</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.059" end="02:17:38.130" style="s2">from books and lectures yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.590" end="02:17:41.700" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.130" end="02:17:43.920" style="s2">like don&#39;t be taking notes during the</p>
<p begin="02:17:41.700" end="02:17:46.250" style="s2">lecture exactly because then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:17:43.920" end="02:17:48.210" style="s2">listening to the lecture it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.250" end="02:17:49.860" style="s2">listen to the lecture and then take</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.210" end="02:17:51.510" style="s2">notes afterwards now that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.860" end="02:17:53.660" style="s2">for every discipline but but it</p>
<p begin="02:17:51.510" end="02:17:55.979" style="s2">certainly works for disciplines like</p>
<p begin="02:17:53.660" end="02:17:58.860" style="s2">students in my lectures I always tell</p>
<p begin="02:17:55.979" end="02:18:01.320" style="s2">them don&#39;t take notes during the lecture</p>
<p begin="02:17:58.860" end="02:18:02.880" style="s2">listen to the damn lecture you can take</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.320" end="02:18:05.599" style="s2">notes afterwards because what that does</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.880" end="02:18:08.269" style="s2">is force you to practice remembering</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.599" end="02:18:12.409" style="s2">and then with regards to books is like</p>
<p begin="02:18:08.269" end="02:18:14.300" style="s2">read don&#39;t highlight don&#39;t underline</p>
<p begin="02:18:12.409" end="02:18:16.909" style="s2">like that I think that that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:18:14.300" end="02:18:18.889" style="s2">rubbish I think it&#39;s pseudo work read a</p>
<p begin="02:18:16.909" end="02:18:20.420" style="s2">couple of paragraphs or maybe an essay</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.889" end="02:18:23.000" style="s2">something like that depending on the</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.420" end="02:18:23.540" style="s2">density of the book close the book think</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.000" end="02:18:25.639" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.540" end="02:18:28.670" style="s2">write down what you&#39;re thinking write</p>
<p begin="02:18:25.639" end="02:18:30.019" style="s2">down what you remember but but but in</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.670" end="02:18:32.989" style="s2">the context of what you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.019" end="02:18:35.059" style="s2">about because that instantiates it into</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.989" end="02:18:37.550" style="s2">your memory and give and puts it at hand</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.059" end="02:18:38.960" style="s2">like people ask me for example how it is</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.550" end="02:18:40.939" style="s2">that I can remember all the things that</p>
<p begin="02:18:38.960" end="02:18:42.739" style="s2">I talk about extemporaneously when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.939" end="02:18:45.920" style="s2">lecturing and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.739" end="02:18:47.809" style="s2">because I&#39;ve thought them through you</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.920" end="02:18:51.139" style="s2">know I read them and I think oh okay</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.809" end="02:18:52.699" style="s2">well that&#39;s an interesting idea how does</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.139" end="02:18:55.099" style="s2">it relate to all these other ideas that</p>
<p begin="02:18:52.699" end="02:18:56.300" style="s2">I know like what is it significance for</p>
<p begin="02:18:55.099" end="02:18:58.369" style="s2">this idea and what&#39;s its significance</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.300" end="02:19:00.649" style="s2">for this idea and do I believe it and</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.369" end="02:19:02.750" style="s2">how might I criticize it so it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:19:00.649" end="02:19:05.179" style="s2">like I&#39;m I&#39;m attaching little memory</p>
<p begin="02:19:02.750" end="02:19:07.130" style="s2">hooks to it in in five different ways</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.179" end="02:19:09.889" style="s2">and then I&#39;ve got it it&#39;s it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="02:19:07.130" end="02:19:13.760" style="s2">me and that seems to be part of recall</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.889" end="02:19:16.880" style="s2">rather than so rather than recognition</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.760" end="02:19:19.399" style="s2">and recall is the spontaneous act of</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.880" end="02:19:20.840" style="s2">remembering something complex and when</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.399" end="02:19:23.269" style="s2">you recall something you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.840" end="02:19:24.710" style="s2">practicing remembering it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.269" end="02:19:28.909" style="s2">what you need to do if you want that to</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.710" end="02:19:30.380" style="s2">be part of you so I would say separate</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.909" end="02:19:35.540" style="s2">out the function of reading and</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.380" end="02:19:37.790" style="s2">note-taking so read think write or read</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.540" end="02:19:39.979" style="s2">write think look because the last two</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.790" end="02:19:42.229" style="s2">things are quite similar but don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.979" end="02:19:43.969" style="s2">read the book and then read a sentence</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.229" end="02:19:46.729" style="s2">and then write down that sentence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.969" end="02:19:48.859" style="s2">not helpful you could read the sentence</p>
<p begin="02:19:46.729" end="02:19:50.510" style="s2">close the book and then reformulate the</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.859" end="02:19:52.040" style="s2">sentence so that now it&#39;s your sentence</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.510" end="02:19:53.560" style="s2">man then you&#39;ll remember it then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.040" end="02:19:56.569" style="s2">understand that that works really well</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.560" end="02:19:58.040" style="s2">what a post modernists have right there</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.569" end="02:20:01.100" style="s2">is an infinite number of ways to</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.040" end="02:20:03.680" style="s2">perceive the world that&#39;s what they have</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.100" end="02:20:05.659" style="s2">right and that&#39;s bloody major discovery</p>
<p begin="02:20:03.680" end="02:20:07.640" style="s2">it was the same discovery that blew the</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.659" end="02:20:10.310" style="s2">slats out of artificial intelligence in</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.640" end="02:20:12.979" style="s2">its early instantiation in the 1960s so</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.310" end="02:20:15.170" style="s2">the idea that the world is so complex</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.979" end="02:20:16.930" style="s2">that there is in principle an infinite</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.170" end="02:20:19.400" style="s2">number of ways to perceive it is correct</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.930" end="02:20:22.101" style="s2">but the idea that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.400" end="02:20:24.080" style="s2">order of rank difference between those</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.101" end="02:20:25.551" style="s2">modes of perception that&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.080" end="02:20:28.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where the postmodernist went</p>
<p begin="02:20:25.551" end="02:20:30.530" style="s2">completely off the rails so they just</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.040" end="02:20:31.790" style="s2">they they got the problem right but they</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.530" end="02:20:37.641" style="s2">didn&#39;t take their thinking about it</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.790" end="02:20:39.500" style="s2">nearly far enough so okay let&#39;s say you</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.641" end="02:20:41.030" style="s2">mentioned switching to a paleo diet some</p>
<p begin="02:20:39.500" end="02:20:42.530" style="s2">time ago and from the way your physical</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.030" end="02:20:44.480" style="s2">appearance seems to improved I would say</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.530" end="02:20:48.230" style="s2">it&#39;s working quite well could we have</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.480" end="02:20:51.261" style="s2">more details into your diet yeah you</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.230" end="02:20:53.750" style="s2">could for a year and a half I basically</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.261" end="02:20:55.011" style="s2">haven&#39;t eaten any carbohydrates so I</p>
<p begin="02:20:53.750" end="02:20:58.210" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t recommend it though because</p>
<p begin="02:20:55.011" end="02:21:01.070" style="s2">it&#39;s really not it it&#39;s hard and it also</p>
<p begin="02:20:58.210" end="02:21:02.721" style="s2">makes you unpopular I can&#39;t really go to</p>
<p begin="02:21:01.070" end="02:21:05.631" style="s2">restaurants it&#39;s very difficult for me</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.721" end="02:21:08.870" style="s2">to go to other people&#39;s places to eat it</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.631" end="02:21:10.370" style="s2">makes traveling a real pain but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:21:08.870" end="02:21:13.040" style="s2">tell you if you want to lose weight man</p>
<p begin="02:21:10.370" end="02:21:14.960" style="s2">and that is really why I did this by the</p>
<p begin="02:21:13.040" end="02:21:17.780" style="s2">way but if you want to lose weight if</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.960" end="02:21:21.021" style="s2">you cut carbohydrates out of your diet</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.780" end="02:21:23.721" style="s2">and go on a paleo light diet heavy</p>
<p begin="02:21:21.021" end="02:21:25.881" style="s2">protein and greens and that sort of</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.721" end="02:21:27.620" style="s2">thing and you can eat a lot of that so</p>
<p begin="02:21:25.881" end="02:21:29.150" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be hungry my</p>
<p begin="02:21:27.620" end="02:21:30.681" style="s2">experience has been and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.150" end="02:21:32.480" style="s2">not the same with everyone but I also</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.681" end="02:21:34.101" style="s2">know other people who&#39;ve tried this on</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.480" end="02:21:37.431" style="s2">my brother-in-law who&#39;s actually quite a</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.101" end="02:21:38.631" style="s2">great genius has he&#39;s 60 now and he&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="02:21:37.431" end="02:21:41.271" style="s2">better shape than he was when he was in</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.631" end="02:21:43.341" style="s2">45 45 he&#39;s a bloody monster that guy</p>
<p begin="02:21:41.271" end="02:21:45.141" style="s2">really tough really physically put</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.341" end="02:21:47.000" style="s2">together super smart and he&#39;s followed a</p>
<p begin="02:21:45.141" end="02:21:48.950" style="s2">paleo diet for about 15 years and like</p>
<p begin="02:21:47.000" end="02:21:52.040" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have an ounce of fat on him</p>
<p begin="02:21:48.950" end="02:21:54.530" style="s2">so if you want to lose weight drop the</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.040" end="02:21:55.851" style="s2">carbs and you&#39;ll lose weight so fast you</p>
<p begin="02:21:54.530" end="02:21:58.521" style="s2">won&#39;t believe it and you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.851" end="02:22:01.070" style="s2">be hungry so I don&#39;t want to go into it</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.521" end="02:22:02.601" style="s2">more depth because it&#39;s Jesus Christ I</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.070" end="02:22:04.551" style="s2">spent so much time talking about my</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.601" end="02:22:07.131" style="s2">bloody diet over the last year that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.551" end="02:22:09.200" style="s2">just bored me to death that&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.131" end="02:22:12.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s so funny because just</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.200" end="02:22:14.030" style="s2">before last September when I made those</p>
<p begin="02:22:12.500" end="02:22:15.561" style="s2">first videos I was sitting around with</p>
<p begin="02:22:14.030" end="02:22:18.080" style="s2">my family and we&#39;d been talking about</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.561" end="02:22:19.610" style="s2">diet god non-stop because partly because</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.080" end="02:22:22.101" style="s2">of my daughter&#39;s health problems and</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.610" end="02:22:25.341" style="s2">also like it&#39;s like everyday discussion</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.101" end="02:22:27.381" style="s2">about diet it was just paralyzing me and</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.341" end="02:22:30.891" style="s2">I thought god I hope I wish that we can</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.381" end="02:22:32.660" style="s2">find something else to talk about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:30.891" end="02:22:35.360" style="s2">like well that sure happened</p>
<p begin="02:22:32.660" end="02:22:36.891" style="s2">so what is your advice for people that</p>
<p begin="02:22:35.360" end="02:22:41.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t very social and have a hard time</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.891" end="02:22:44.900" style="s2">making friends get the hell out there in</p>

<p begin="02:22:49.340" end="02:22:54.050" style="s2">not very well socialized extremely</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.380" end="02:22:57.830" style="s2">socially anxious awkward in her social</p>
<p begin="02:22:54.050" end="02:23:00.080" style="s2">interactions as well so not skilled she</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.830" end="02:23:02.061" style="s2">did and also alone she didn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.080" end="02:23:04.521" style="s2">intimate relationship or really any</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.061" end="02:23:06.230" style="s2">family so quite quite isolated person</p>
<p begin="02:23:04.521" end="02:23:08.150" style="s2">and terrified of social interactions</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.230" end="02:23:10.340" style="s2">like she couldn&#39;t even go out and have a</p>

<p begin="02:23:34.940" end="02:23:38.450" style="s2">know that&#39;s a really good thing if</p>
<p begin="02:23:36.141" end="02:23:40.700" style="s2">you&#39;re not very social and and you get</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.450" end="02:23:42.440" style="s2">self-conscious you start thinking about</p>
<p begin="02:23:40.700" end="02:23:44.990" style="s2">yourself and how stupid you are that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.440" end="02:23:46.820" style="s2">really bad idea you should be paying</p>
<p begin="02:23:44.990" end="02:23:50.120" style="s2">attention to the other person so if you</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.820" end="02:23:51.440" style="s2">get nervous it isn&#39;t that you have to</p>
<p begin="02:23:50.120" end="02:23:52.730" style="s2">stop being nervous because that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.440" end="02:23:54.141" style="s2">going to work what you have to do is</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.730" end="02:23:55.851" style="s2">start paying more attention to the other</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.141" end="02:23:58.190" style="s2">person you have to force your attention</p>
<p begin="02:23:55.851" end="02:24:00.771" style="s2">outward and you know you can ask people</p>
<p begin="02:23:58.190" end="02:24:02.540" style="s2">questions listen to them and when they</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.771" end="02:24:04.340" style="s2">say something interesting or they say</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.540" end="02:24:06.680" style="s2">something you don&#39;t understand ask them</p>
<p begin="02:24:04.340" end="02:24:08.510" style="s2">a question and people love that man</p>
<p begin="02:24:06.680" end="02:24:09.891" style="s2">because they know you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="02:24:08.510" end="02:24:14.240" style="s2">them and people love being listened to</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.891" end="02:24:16.641" style="s2">so if you&#39;re nervous learn to listen</p>
<p begin="02:24:14.240" end="02:24:19.040" style="s2">better and learn to ask questions and</p>
<p begin="02:24:16.641" end="02:24:21.740" style="s2">and there&#39;s no stupid questions if</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.040" end="02:24:23.360" style="s2">you&#39;re paying attention right and so you</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.740" end="02:24:25.220" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about that if you</p>
<p begin="02:24:23.360" end="02:24:26.750" style="s2">don&#39;t know something if you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:24:25.220" end="02:24:28.580" style="s2">something and you ask an honest question</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.750" end="02:24:30.141" style="s2">and someone treats you badly because of</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.580" end="02:24:31.641" style="s2">it then you should just go away from</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.141" end="02:24:36.290" style="s2">that person because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.641" end="02:24:38.210" style="s2">clue so get out there um forget about</p>
<p begin="02:24:36.290" end="02:24:39.440" style="s2">trying to not be nervous because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.210" end="02:24:41.120" style="s2">going to be nervous but when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.440" end="02:24:41.720" style="s2">nervous pay more attention to other</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.120" end="02:24:44.260" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="02:24:41.720" end="02:24:46.040" style="s2">listen to them carefully watch them</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.260" end="02:24:47.900" style="s2">because then your</p>
<p begin="02:24:46.040" end="02:24:50.870" style="s2">natural social abilities will kick in</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.900" end="02:24:52.640" style="s2">and ask them questions and you know</p>
<p begin="02:24:50.870" end="02:24:54.560" style="s2">you&#39;ll assume it&#39;ll take you three or</p>
<p begin="02:24:52.640" end="02:24:56.150" style="s2">four years to get decently good at it</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.560" end="02:24:58.850" style="s2">and that you really have to work at it</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.150" end="02:25:01.070" style="s2">but it&#39;s worth it man so so just go out</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.850" end="02:25:01.700" style="s2">there and and do it and you&#39;ll you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.070" end="02:25:05.780" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="02:25:01.700" end="02:25:10.610" style="s2">you&#39;ll figure it out so alright guys and</p>
