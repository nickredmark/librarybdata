<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">quite a few years and then after</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.479" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">the evergreen meltdown i more or less</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">had to walk away from facebook because</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">it became such a toxic</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:18.080" style="s2">environment so i am a very</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">occasional user of the platform and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.080" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i have used it in the last</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">several weeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">if i logged on it would have been once</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:32.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m not sure that i posted anything</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">and in spite of my lack of activity i</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.640" style="s2">evicted from the platform which i</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">discovered when</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.640" end="00:02:40.640" style="s2">a friend posted a link in a private</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:42.080" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.640" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">to something that someone else had</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.080" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">placed on facebook i clicked the link</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">and a warning popped up that said</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">that my account had been i&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:56.720" style="s2">the exact language but effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">deleted that a review had already been</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.720" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">conducted</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">that i had somehow violated the</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">community guidelines in no way that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">specified and that the decision</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">could not be reversed yeah i got it</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">right here let me read it for you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">because i</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">uh when i saw that when you posted it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">over on twitter i said this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">delectable combination</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">of both orwellian and kafka-esque</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">right quite excellent from facebook</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">you cannot use facebook because your</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">account or activity on it didn&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:31.200" style="s2">our community standards which you and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.799" style="s2">both know is about 75 pages of</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.200" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">gobbledygook</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.799" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">we&#39;ve already reviewed this decision and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">it cannot</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">be reversed that&#39;s what it said</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">cannot be reversed has already been</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">reviewed that&#39;s very striking</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.640" style="s2">now my sense is if i was a normal user</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">of facebook</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.640" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">then i would have engaged in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">activity and i would have been left</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">scratching my head trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">wonder where it is that i tripped over</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">one community guideline or another but</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">given that i wasn&#39;t using the platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">at all it was pretty clear that this was</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.840" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">either a massive error which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.840" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">incompatible with their claim to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">reviewed it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">and the decision being irreversible or</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">that this was personal about something</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">that facebook didn&#39;t like about me and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:23.440" style="s2">that it had decided not to wait for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:25.600" style="s2">to do anything it could portray as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.440" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">violation of a community guideline and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.600" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">tossed me off just based on</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">the uh incompatibility of my character</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:34.800" style="s2">with their platform or something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.800" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">of course there&#39;s the third possibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:40.000" style="s2">i was i was thinking about this one is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.560" style="s2">uh you know it could have been an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.000" end="00:04:44.800" style="s2">algorithm run amok uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.560" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">but you know the message we have already</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.800" end="00:04:48.800" style="s2">reviewed this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">decision and it cannot be reversed does</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.800" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">not sound like the thing even the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:53.440" style="s2">chuckleheads that</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:55.199" style="s2">facebook would have given to an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.440" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">algorithm basically a death sentence</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.199" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">with no appeal</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">based on an algorithmic checkbox but</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">with those chuckleheads you never know</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">uh yes it could also have been uh you</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.960" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">know a conscious decision but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">third one also and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.000" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">maybe this is my occam&#39;s razor one i</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know love know what you think</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">about it what you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">if anything from them and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">disgruntled</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">employee somewhere in the bowels of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:17.919" style="s2">facebook who happen to have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:19.360" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.919" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t like you for one reason or</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.360" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">another and typically about your</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">and decided to blink you uh so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:26.800" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">the third possibility i would put out</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.800" end="00:05:30.400" style="s2">there yeah i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be somewhere in that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.400" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">neighborhood but i don&#39;t see any reason</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">as far as with respect to official</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">communications you were found guilty</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">executed or</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">uh then you were released</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:53.840" style="s2">with no explanation i prefer to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">that i was executed</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.840" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">and that i rose from the dead but um</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">yeah ah</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">on they do what they want</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">uh for probably uh strategic reasons but</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">who the hell knows right very very scary</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:25.360" style="s2">that we have allowed our public square</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">to be controlled by people like this</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.360" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">uh it&#39;s terrifying um because at some</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:32.080" style="s2">level we don&#39;t have an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">public square where we can take our</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.080" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">business so we are condemned</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.800" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">i think it is clearly the case</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:58.720" style="s2">that as we become more deranged</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">that the uh the ghost and the machine</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.720" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">is these platforms yep it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:05.279" style="s2">very very scary particularly those of us</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">who can think</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.279" end="00:09:08.640" style="s2">through uh what the evolution of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">network looks like</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.640" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">when somebody can modulate the</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">on the network at their will yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:21.120" style="s2">absolutely it&#39;s um it&#39;s basically like</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">the kind of control that a magician</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.120" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">has over what the audience can see</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">know that they&#39;re attending a magic show</p>

<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:44.160" style="s2">they didn&#39;t quite uh go into this level</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.120" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">of of malice essentially they were more</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.160" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">looking at the implications of uh the</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">intentionally distorting discourse</p>

<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">think i got about</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.959" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">a minute of all people brett</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.560" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">i mean talk about good faith discourse</p>

<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">but he&#39;s without a doubt a solid good</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">at all yes now there&#39;s a question about</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.040" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">um attacking me in this way with</p>

<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">a bit stronger because uh it has</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">they&#39;re really doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">is um eliminating people who are beyond</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">the pale</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">yeah i think if indeed this was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">act of malice uh then that is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">uh and it&#39;s some significant chance that</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">it was i mean particularly the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">that message</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:20.320" style="s2">we have we have already reviewed this</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.320" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">and it can&#39;t be reversed that does not</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:28.160" style="s2">sound like an automated</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:30.079" style="s2">uh bot uh you know anyone who would give</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.160" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">that much discretion to a bot that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.079" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not good in its own self</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">yes now my guess actually would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">uh so you know it was interesting there</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">was there was one action i could take</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">on that warning message and it involved</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">downloading</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:47.839" style="s2">what facebook called my information</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">which is to say information that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.839" end="00:11:53.839" style="s2">facebook had collected on me</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:55.680" style="s2">and uh it was alarming</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.839" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">you know no surprise really but to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.680" end="00:12:00.959" style="s2">actually be faced with what facebook</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:02.480" style="s2">has accumulated in terms of you know who</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.959" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve interacted with</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.480" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">what i&#39;ve liked uh when i&#39;ve logged in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s quite clear and you know obvious</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:12.240" style="s2">that facebook has</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.480" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">more information than the stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.240" end="00:12:18.720" style="s2">in the pdf file they gave me</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">but the um the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.720" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">fact i believe is that facebook a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly have mistaken me</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:30.320" style="s2">for a bot or anything other than a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:30.720" style="s2">person my account was so long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.320" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.720" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">behaved so much like an actual human</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:36.240" style="s2">being that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">there&#39;s no way you know it would have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.240" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">be an amazingly stupid algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:42.720" style="s2">that you would never actually empower in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:45.920" style="s2">the world to evict people</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.720" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">if it mistook my account but</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.920" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">what they would have known is that my</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:53.040" style="s2">hesitancy to use facebook in the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">several years</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.040" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">is extreme enough that there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">that i wasn&#39;t going to log in and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:03.440" style="s2">discover that i had been booted</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">until after the election so i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.440" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">they were not</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">expecting that this would be discovered</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">at some later date and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">that the accident of my having been</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">directed to a link by a friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">basically brought this into into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">public sphere early</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:23.600" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and not not</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:25.120" style="s2">contemplating that they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.600" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">disable the</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.120" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">uh the counterwave essentially in</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">yes and we know actually uh material</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">that emerged</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">yesterday i believe suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">facebook</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">is already building a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">mechanism it says for addressing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">post-election violence which they</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.279" style="s2">consider likely and i also think</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:52.160" style="s2">post-election violence is likely but</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.279" end="00:13:53.519" style="s2">the question is what exactly is facebook</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.160" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">planning to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.519" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">it is planning presumably to control</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:02.399" style="s2">our discussion with each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">situation in which an election</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.399" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">results in a contested outcome and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">at some level who the hell are they but</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">given that they seem to think that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:16.079" style="s2">are entitled to modulate our discussions</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">with each other on the essential</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.079" end="00:14:20.959" style="s2">matters of of our governance i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">imagine that they would view</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.959" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">me as very inconvenient to any narrative</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">portray because i am a</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">uh a liberal a radical as i&#39;ve described</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">and yet i&#39;m not uh in any way</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">ready to tolerate the influence peddling</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">of the dnc yeah it&#39;s certainly possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">though i will say i mean this thing we</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">have to be careful about</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:50.560" style="s2">is uh that</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very tempting to ascribe</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.560" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">behavior to malice when</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">fairly often it&#39;s incompetence and i can</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:57.519" style="s2">give you a personal example that&#39;s to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">with facebook</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.519" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">uh from very occasionally i&#39;ll try to uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">do what they call a boost on one of my</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">podcast episodes i have you know post a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:09.519" style="s2">a story about each episode in a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">standard format on</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.519" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">the jim rut show facebook page and a few</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">other places</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">uh maybe every few months there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">that i think has enough profile that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:20.880" style="s2">throwing 50 bucks on and see what</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">happens if it works i&#39;ll throw another</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.880" end="00:15:23.600" style="s2">50.</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">the most recently the most recent one i</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.600" end="00:15:27.040" style="s2">did was with former secretary of defense</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">william perry</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.040" end="00:15:30.959" style="s2">about his establishmentarian a character</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">as you could possibly get</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.959" end="00:15:34.160" style="s2">and his co-author on his new book the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:36.399" style="s2">button</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.160" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">a very serious establishmentarian</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.399" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">discussion of nuclear policy</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">nuclear arms control and control of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">nuclear weapons</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">and guess what the ad was rejected and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">appealed and they rejected it again</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">right what the well</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">so let me ask you a question um i</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">understand and agree that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">ineptitude creates something that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">would be tempted to dismiss as malice</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:05.600" style="s2">in that case though i don&#39;t know how why</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">are you sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.600" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">that the rejection of that ad</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:15.040" style="s2">was incompetence when twitter and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">facebook and google are you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.040" end="00:16:19.360" style="s2">not just establishment but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">highly partisan</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.360" end="00:16:23.120" style="s2">well again william perry secretary of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">defense under clinton</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.120" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">uh the basic tenor of the book is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">at least partially motivated by distrust</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.880" style="s2">of the psychological stability of trump</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.880" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">if this has any partisan valence which</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">it does maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:40.880" style="s2">bit it points blue but in a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">establishmentary and blue church kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.880" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">so yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">uh but anyway and this is not the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">time i had another one uh</p>

<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:57.920" style="s2">uh her the ad for her episode was also</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.920" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">and i go what and at that point i was</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">running a few more ads on facebook and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">had my ad team intervene they got it</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">turned around and they said</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">yeah it was a stupid-ass algorithm uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:10.480" style="s2">that somehow decided it was</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.480" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">okay search for extraterrestrial</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.400" style="s2">intelligence and nuclear arms policy</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:17.439" style="s2">those seem like really bad things to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.400" end="00:17:19.120" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.439" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">with two of the world&#39;s leading experts</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.120" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">on them right i mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:24.160" style="s2">you never know what the algorithms are</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.630" style="s2">worried about it&#39;s possible that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.160" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">aliens could be underage</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">well actually the other thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">aliens could have already infiltrated</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:33.039" style="s2">facebook and they don&#39;t want any talking</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">malice and i think something about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:46.559" style="s2">wording of that message makes me think</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.559" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">okay but uh these guys are chuckleheads</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:53.600" style="s2">and they up all the time yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.600" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">there&#39;s something very odd about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">one and only communication indicating</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">what took place coming from somebody</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">who is so closely associated with</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">the dnc yeah that&#39;s weird too and also</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:11.919" style="s2">of course the high hilarity that they</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">did it on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.919" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">yes well of course yeah twitter in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">reply</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">you know reply to twitter and they have</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">your email right part of signing up for</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">facebook and you give them your email</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">uh you know they could have easily</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">emailed you something uh but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">somebody uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">pops into a reply on a stream on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">i mean yep</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:33.280" style="s2">of course uh yeah it is very odd uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.360" style="s2">very odd but let&#39;s leave it at that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.280" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">could talk about the foibles of facebook</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.360" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">uh why it&#39;s terrible and why frankly</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:40.880" style="s2">many of us are starting to build</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">alternatives and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.880" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">on other platforms and there are many</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">many uh community</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:48.400" style="s2">uh type platforms out there where you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">can sort of set up your own environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">and many of us are doing that right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:57.120" style="s2">uh and but unfortunately that may have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">an even worse effect which is if nothing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.120" end="00:19:00.960" style="s2">at least originally facebook was an open</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:01.840" style="s2">public square where people from all</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.960" end="00:19:03.600" style="s2">sectors</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.840" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">could come together and compare and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.600" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">contrast their ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">if if this breakup occurs and those who</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">are serious about talking about ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">retreat to our own</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">private enclaves uh the filter bubble</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">effect will actually get worse</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:19.440" style="s2">yep i agree with that and so i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">these people are stupid as</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.440" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">uh for if that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">do and they certainly are i mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">bouncing people for point of view</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">uh all the time you know you know as</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">much as i think q anon are a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">uh mental defectives uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">people want to you know part if they</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:36.720" style="s2">want to frankly i don&#39;t think it&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.360" style="s2">crazier than</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.720" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">the catholicism i was raised right tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.360" end="00:19:42.960" style="s2">you the truth about equally absurd well</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">i would say catholicism will a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.960" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">bit more absurd uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">and but if you want to champion</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:51.120" style="s2">catholicism or q anon</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:54.480" style="s2">in the public square why not</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.120" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">well not only why not i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.480" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">all thinking americans understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:03.280" style="s2">that whatever you may want to censor the</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">instinct to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.280" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">worse than the problem you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">cure yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:11.600" style="s2">and and we know again every example from</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.240" style="s2">history it never stops with okay oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.600" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">nazis bad yes we both agree with nazis</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.240" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">bad</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">kill nazis with bombs okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">we&#39;re there actual german nazis 1933 to</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">1945</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">all four killing them so we&#39;ll censor</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">actual nazis you know the few that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:30.559" style="s2">still alive</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">all right we can agree on that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.559" end="00:20:34.799" style="s2">but that&#39;s the slippery slope</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">you know it used to be the liberals yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.799" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you remember the aclu</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:40.159" style="s2">actually famously fought for the right</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">of nazis</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.159" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">real american nazis at least to march</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:46.559" style="s2">through skokie of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:48.720" style="s2">a community in illinois that had a large</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.559" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">population of holocaust survivors in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.720" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">you know distasteful as</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">but we used to think that was part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">what america stood for</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.240" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">yep it uh it must be distasteful as the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.240" style="s2">the majority of the speech we would like</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">to ban is</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.240" end="00:21:05.440" style="s2">there&#39;s no good way of being surgical</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">about it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.440" end="00:21:10.000" style="s2">we dare not yeah and somebody&#39;s uh one</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">some famous thinker can&#39;t remember who</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.000" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">uh of course uh it&#39;s easy to defend</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.280" style="s2">speech we agree with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">the principles about speech we violently</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:21.600" style="s2">disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">absolutely all right so let&#39;s move on to</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.600" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">unity 2020. uh first what was your</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">motivation and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">you know at the highest level what was</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:32.880" style="s2">unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">all right um the motivation for unity</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.880" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">2020 which started out under a different</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.760" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">name but</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">was the recognition that once again</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:49.200" style="s2">our political apparatus had delivered us</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">a uh an election in which no</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:52.240" style="s2">good choices were available every single</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:55.360" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.240" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">was going to be forced into engaging</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.360" end="00:22:02.480" style="s2">in some kind of harmful</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">vote or refusal to vote and that this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.480" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">an unacceptable position to be in and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason that it should be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">natural state</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">in a functioning democratic republic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">we needed to break out of the cycle</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">that has increasingly caused this to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">the default</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.600" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s stop here make clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:23.840" style="s2">this uh specifically</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.600" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">the the choice that was bad was that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.840" end="00:22:27.440" style="s2">launched it about the time it became</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">clear that the democratic nominee</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.440" end="00:22:31.520" style="s2">was going to be joe biden and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">republican nominee was going to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.520" end="00:22:39.200" style="s2">donald trump yep that&#39;s no choice at all</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">and so the plan that i announced</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.200" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">was a plan in which we would draft</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">two individuals they would have to meet</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">three characteristics they would have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:53.520" style="s2">courageous capable and patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:55.280" style="s2">and of course would have to meet the</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.520" end="00:22:56.320" style="s2">constitutional requirements for holding</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.280" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">the office</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">we would draft them under an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">govern jointly by consensus</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:11.360" style="s2">they would run on a ticket</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">the top position the presidency would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.360" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">established by a coin flip in advance of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">uh us draft uh in it after we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">drafted them but in advance</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">of them arriving on the ballot they</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">would flip a coin and decide who was</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.559" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">going to run for the presidential slot</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">uh after four years the positions would</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">reverse and the person who had</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.760" style="s2">inhabited the role of the presidency</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">would run for the vice presidency and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.760" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">and this could continue until one person</p>

<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:47.679" style="s2">would be replaced</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">by someone suitable i&#39;m not sure if i</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.679" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">that these two individuals one would</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">come from the left and one would come</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:59.520" style="s2">from the right and the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">this would mean everybody would know</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.520" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">that their interests were going to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">represented in the room</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">where the discussion of what policy</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">was to be pursued was taking place</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">so that was the plan and it garnered a</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.559" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">large number of volunteers who were very</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">about the plan and a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.440" style="s2">interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">amongst people who recognized that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.440" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">was something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">with the major party offerings</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">it did not however garner the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">groundswell that would have allowed us</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:35.679" style="s2">to draft</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.120" style="s2">these candidates we did go through a</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.679" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">nomination process</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.120" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">and we arrived at a ticket the ticket</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">was tulsi gabbard and dan crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">and what would have</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:49.679" style="s2">put us in the running was enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.080" end="00:24:53.120" style="s2">groundswell that we could have</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.679" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">drafted those two people um</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.120" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">but that groundswell did not arrive as</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:59.120" style="s2">much as people were very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">unity 2020 that just simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.120" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">wasn&#39;t enough visible enthusiasm to go</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:05.440" style="s2">through that process</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">got it now you told me about it and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.440" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">talked about it when you were first</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">getting ready to launch it and i then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">hopped on the internet and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:14.080" style="s2">i remember you and i originally got</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.080" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">back in the days of the old emancipation</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:21.600" style="s2">party and this was a precursor to game b</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:23.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s still up our very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.600" end="00:25:25.360" style="s2">reforms and proposals at</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.720" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">emancipationparty.org</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.360" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">and at that time i was the one who was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">in charge of learning about ballot</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">access</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">and all the things you need to do how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">deal with the federal elections</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">commission etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">and my take at the time was brett this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">is a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">clever idea i love it a lot but there is</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:41.760" style="s2">no way you&#39;re going to get on</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:43.840" style="s2">the ballot</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.760" end="00:25:44.960" style="s2">of very many states starting you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.840" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">around april</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.960" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">uh the you know the first deadlines are</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">coming up in may and the big ones are</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">coming really soon thereafter</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t see how you&#39;re going to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.159" style="s2">what was your approach to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">getting ballot access</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.159" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">well we uh very quickly looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.640" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">question of ballot access and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">right there was going to be no way to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">through the front door and get ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:09.679" style="s2">on the ballots of enough states</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">to to compete in an election</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.679" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">however there was another mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.600" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">which was the partnering</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">with third parties that had ballot</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:23.279" style="s2">access and it could have been</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say the libertarian party which</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.279" end="00:26:28.240" style="s2">has access in all 50 states</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">it could have been the green party which</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.240" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">had access in</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">almost all of the states or it could</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">have been a combination of regional</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">parties</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">the problem was this required</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">a recognition on the part of third</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">parties</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">that we were in an emergency situation</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.480" style="s2">in which the particular ideologies that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">they represented</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.480" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">were a secondary consideration to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">challenging the catastrophe that duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">had set us up for</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:27:02.880" style="s2">and we did have interesting discussions</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">back channel with highly placed people</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">in a number of third parties including</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">the major ones</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">however the problem</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">game theoretically and you know this</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">could be argued is totally foreseeable</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">is that in the case where the duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.919" style="s2">has screwed up</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">and has delivered a completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.919" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">non-viable election</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">the third parties which ordinarily are</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">competitive see the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">this time might be different</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.840" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2">now what we tried to explain</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">and again back channel this was received</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:45.600" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">was that there was actually some very</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">good reasons that a third party that was</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">interested</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">in long term having its ideological</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">position advanced</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">would be interested in partnering with</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">the unity movement short term</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">so if sufficient success at the ballot</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">box</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">can be attained federal funds go</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">to the party that has attained that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">success in the next</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:10.000" style="s2">election and so there is potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:12.399" style="s2">lot of money for</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.000" end="00:28:13.919" style="s2">greens or libertarians or both that wish</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.399" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">to partner</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.919" end="00:28:19.440" style="s2">with us what&#39;s more the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:20.720" style="s2">to the duopoly where it&#39;s successful</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.440" end="00:28:22.799" style="s2">would have allowed us</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.720" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">to pursue ranked choice voting which</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.799" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">would of course empower third parties</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:31.210" style="s2">in future elections to advance their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">agendas but in the end the</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">public groundswell was too small</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">and that meant that the third parties</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">held the ballot access that they could</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">were not interested and i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">understandably so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">yep that makes sense so it was an</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">interesting concept but it had an awful</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">lot of had to works and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:58.159" style="s2">uh you know and the key one was the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">groundswell which just didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.159" end="00:29:01.200" style="s2">yeah now i do in retrospect think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.200" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">a better way of conceiving the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:09.039" style="s2">frankly sure that we didn&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">through this exercise in order to figure</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.039" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:14.799" style="s2">where we were and uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">what was too far outside the overton</p>

<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:29.200" style="s2">this is the the deep problem of the</p>

<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">duopoly for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:47.760" style="s2">and that is of course the lesser of two</p>

<p begin="00:29:47.760" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">uh i you know you see this unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">thing go yeah if everything was perfect</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">i would definitely rather have tulsi</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:58.960" style="s2">gabbard and dan crenshaw than</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">uh the other two alternatives but if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.960" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">a democrat i&#39;ll say i surely don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">want donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">and if i&#39;m a republican i&#39;ll say i sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">as don&#39;t want uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">joe biden so i am not going to take that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">that they end up splitting the vote and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">uh putting in somebody who i think is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">much worse i mean it&#39;s the old saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">that the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:22.159" style="s2">good and better is a lot less than</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.159" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">uh good and worse so the famous</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.279" style="s2">uh lesser of two evils conundrum is i</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">think a real powerful</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.279" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">game theoretical trap and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">somehow get over</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">a credibility probability threshold</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">the people back away from that attractor</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">well i i think unfortunately people have</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">accepted it and they have forgotten to</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:49.919" style="s2">think about</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">the logic that actually undergirds it so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.919" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">in general</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">the lesser of two evils paradox</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">may govern the thinking of a strategic</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">voter</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">but the first thing to recognize is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">elections are not one-off events they</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">iterated and that changes the game</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">theory dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:11.440" style="s2">so in effect a party that is counting</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">on well in my case the democratic party</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">which has long counted on people</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">to the left of the mainstream the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:19.440" style="s2">democratic party to fall in line when it</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">comes to the election</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.440" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">that that party therefore has no reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">to cater</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">to the interests of those who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">nowhere to go because of the lesser evil</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">problem and therefore the way to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">your interest</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">dealt with is not to fall in line</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">so from the point of view of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">elections taken together</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a good reason to ignore the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">lesser evil paradox</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.600" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">it&#39;s also true though that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:48.799" style="s2">republican party</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">was the uh beneficiary</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">of the collapse of a previous party</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">so to the extent that we have a duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">with two dysfunctional corrupt parties</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:05.919" style="s2">one is looking for a way out the answer</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">may involve uh the birth of one or more</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.919" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">new parties that actually give a damn</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">about our interests</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:13.200" style="s2">yeah that i agree with for sure but uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.200" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">the the space of operating within the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.480" style="s2">game theoretical constraints of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">constitution make it very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.480" end="00:32:22.960" style="s2">though as you point out it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:26.240" style="s2">impossible</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.960" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">uh the whigs were the party that were uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:30.080" style="s2">replaced by the republicans and there</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:31.519" style="s2">was a kind of a fluttery period in there</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.080" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">where there were the free spoilers who</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.519" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">essentially turned into the republicans</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">uh and there were times in the past</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:38.799" style="s2">where third parties</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:40.640" style="s2">uh particularly the progressives in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.799" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">late 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.640" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">and then oddly the socialists uh for a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">time in the 20s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">got some significant numbers of votes</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:49.120" style="s2">but didn&#39;t come close to that tipping</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:53.600" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.120" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s possible but just hard</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.600" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">well it&#39;s hard for only one reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">and that has to do with the willingness</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:06.559" style="s2">of voters to suspend</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:08.000" style="s2">disbelief in a new direction so</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.559" end="00:33:10.480" style="s2">i would argue that there&#39;s an awful lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.000" end="00:33:14.799" style="s2">buried here under the uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">the stone that says lesser of two evils</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.799" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">one thing is that voters</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">when they engage in voting in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">presidential election are already</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">engaged in the suspension of disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">that is to say the chances that your</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:34.559" style="s2">vote</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:38.240" style="s2">will actually alter who takes the office</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.559" end="00:33:41.039" style="s2">are vanishingly close to zero and yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.240" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">people will spend significant time and</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.039" end="00:33:44.880" style="s2">effort to cast that vote</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">and we re we need them to right the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.880" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">democracy depends on people suspending</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:49.919" style="s2">their disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">and behaving as if their vote matters</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.919" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">because uh the</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">the collection of votes does then</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">reflect the will of the people to some</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">extent</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:02.640" style="s2">so the fact that suspension of disbelief</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">is already a part of voting</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.640" end="00:34:06.480" style="s2">means that the possibility exists to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:10.320" style="s2">extend it to this</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.480" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">other question and in this case</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.320" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">um one of the things we discovered in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">the unity movement was that our movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">attractive we structured it by</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">proposing a draft of one person from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">left and one person from the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:29.280" style="s2">we attempted to steer the middle course</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">and to draw equally from both sides so</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">as not to spoil the election</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">and our internal data of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:37.760" style="s2">volunteering</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">reflected exactly this there was a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.760" end="00:34:40.879" style="s2">bias in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">us appealing to people who would</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.879" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">otherwise have voted for donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">but in general it was very evenly split</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">but what surprised us was that a quarter</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:53.200" style="s2">of our volunteers were actually drawn</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">from people who weren&#39;t planning to vote</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.200" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">at all and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">what this tells us something i&#39;ve long</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">been saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:02.800" style="s2">those who don&#39;t vote really come in two</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.800" end="00:35:06.960" style="s2">styles one style is apathetic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">they&#39;re just not paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:10.480" style="s2">the other style is disaffected these are</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">people who potentially</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.480" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">could vote but are so fed up with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">process that takes advantage of them</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:20.560" style="s2">and if those people were to tune back</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">into the process</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.560" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">and vote against the duopoly they are</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">effectively free agents</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:30.880" style="s2">their voting for something</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.560" style="s2">hopeful does not actually empower the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.880" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">greater evil because they weren&#39;t voting</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.560" end="00:35:35.119" style="s2">in the first place so if those people</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:38.560" style="s2">were to return</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.119" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">in large numbers then they would be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.560" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">most powerful political force in the</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">divided non-voters into five or six</p>

<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">uh and but roughly you are correct uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.200" end="00:36:32.400" style="s2">at the highest level you can say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.720" style="s2">a large number of apathetics</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">but then there are others who are uh</p>

<p begin="00:36:51.520" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">categories are larger than the</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.880" end="00:37:03.359" style="s2">so any any election cycle that they</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">wished to announce themselves</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.359" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">as sick of this they could do it</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">and the hope</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">with unity 2020 was that it would</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">catalyze that</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">the discovery was that people are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">basically they do not reopen the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:22.240" style="s2">decision-making process that led them to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:24.320" style="s2">their choice in the past</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.240" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to take something to wake</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.320" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">them up apparently something</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:32.480" style="s2">more frightening than a contest between</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">donald trump and joe biden which i do</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">find</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:40.800" style="s2">also found when we worked on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:41.359" style="s2">emancipation party that getting people</p>

<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">really slow work</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.320" end="00:37:50.240" style="s2">uh and trying to do it in three months</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">just isn&#39;t going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.240" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">at least you know that was my take when</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">i heard the unity 2020 proposal thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">about a little bit did my research i</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">if i had someone asked me to put money</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:02.560" style="s2">on it i would have put long odds on it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">however if we had more time over you</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.560" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">know you take a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">uh at least four year uh time frame and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">and don&#39;t wimp out like we did with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">emancipation party still regret the fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">i know you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:14.640" style="s2">you believe the same thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">should have stuck with the party side of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.640" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">in addition to the game b part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:21.119" style="s2">we didn&#39;t for</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:22.640" style="s2">for for better and probably for worse</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.119" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">but if one were to start</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.640" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">now right after the election and</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">attempt to build a political movement</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">and probably that means a political</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:32.720" style="s2">party or something very much like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">political party</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.720" end="00:38:39.359" style="s2">and attempt to find a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">to mobilize these many tens of millions</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.359" end="00:38:44.400" style="s2">of non-voters as well as to pull</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">people away from the two extremes</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.400" end="00:38:47.680" style="s2">there&#39;s probably an opportunity there</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:48.960" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t happen in three months it</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.680" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen in a year it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.960" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">happen in two years</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">even four years might be a push but if</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">you get it done in</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">eight years that might be enough yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">uh still intact in eight years which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">the reason you know i can</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">do the logic too and the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">changing the way american politics works</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">in three months was</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">long odds as you say on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:14.000" style="s2">as somebody with a fair amount of</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:18.160" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.000" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">in emergency situations</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.160" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">one does very different things in an</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">emergency</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">sometimes one does things that under</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">ordinary circumstances they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:30.160" style="s2">contemplate and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">unity 2020 was the response</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.160" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">to the perception that some of us have</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.720" style="s2">that this election</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:38.720" style="s2">is actually a very serious emergency and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.720" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">that we may not get another shot at this</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.720" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean i think it&#39;s more likely</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">than not that we won&#39;t get another shot</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:46.320" style="s2">but it means the chances of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:48.960" style="s2">catastrophe flowing from frankly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.320" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">victory of either trump or biden</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.960" end="00:39:54.320" style="s2">is so substantial that uh some of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">felt we had to make an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.320" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">yeah that wasn&#39;t at all opposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">attempt but i agree with you uh there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">some chance that this will end badly for</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">the country i</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not i don&#39;t believe as direly as</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:06.560" style="s2">that it&#39;s more likely than not or</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.640" end="00:40:08.160" style="s2">anything like that but it is worth a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.560" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">relatively low cost</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.160" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">and as you also pointed out uh much was</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">learned from this</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:15.839" style="s2">uh process which we&#39;ll talk about in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">little bit uh you know my own view</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.839" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">you know on this is that the there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:24.560" style="s2">definite availability there uh if one</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">can gradually build people&#39;s confidence</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.560" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">and you know i roughly look at what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">wrong with the world in two ways on one</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">side we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">maybe 25 percent of the voters who i</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">troglodytes uh you know these are people</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">who actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">like trump uh not voting for him</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:42.960" style="s2">essentially cynically because he&#39;ll give</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">them tax breaks or reduce government</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.960" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">regulation</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:47.760" style="s2">but 25 of people who think trump</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">actually a good person to be president</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.760" end="00:40:50.720" style="s2">of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:52.400" style="s2">scares the out of me you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">light came on for me in the first debate</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.400" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why i didn&#39;t see it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:57.680" style="s2">but trump is a pre-modern person right</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:40:59.280" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.680" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">logic he doesn&#39;t understand reason he</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.280" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even understand continuity</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">or thought he would have made a good</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:10.800" style="s2">a.d you know in the aftermath of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:53.280" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">we are going to have to do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.839" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">that we are not expected to do we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.119" style="s2">to do something that we are being told</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:04.240" style="s2">is impossible like</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">uh it&#39;s unclear what it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">but it has to be something and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">that the democratic party is effectively</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">running the same playbook that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">did so disastrously in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:26.800" style="s2">with an even less inspiring candidate</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">from most people&#39;s perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.800" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">shocking in fact the thing that is most</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">troubling to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">in this electoral cycle is that people</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.440" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">who see</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.160" style="s2">trump as the only issue until he&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.160" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">office are not livid</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">with the democratic party for paving the</p>

<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:48.720" style="s2">for him to get there which it did yep</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">they certainly</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.720" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">did the worst possible job in 2016 as</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">you and i both agreed and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.480" style="s2">you know i certainly not only was</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">supported but i actually campaigned for</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.480" end="00:44:01.040" style="s2">bernie in 2016. it was actually working</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">in the operation but not only not only</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.040" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">did they</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">run a terrible campaign with a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">candidate</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">but they actually chose trump they</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">wanted him as the opponent and so they</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">advanced his candidacy</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:14.960" style="s2">through surrogates in the press in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">republican field</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.960" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">because he was their uh their desired</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:21.359" style="s2">opponent yeah they thought anybody could</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">beat that clown right that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.359" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">think that was the hillary theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:26.880" style="s2">that was the hillary theory he was the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.960" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">the pied piper candidate</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">and so having discovered that these</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:33.839" style="s2">people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">cynical enough to put the country at</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">risk of a trump presidency</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">means that we should be banging down the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">door of the dnc and saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">how could you do this to us again right</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:49.680" style="s2">how could you give us in this case</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:51.359" style="s2">if these people were really believers in</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.680" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">what they tell us that trump</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.359" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">is this tremendous existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">which frankly he is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">but if they really believed that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">themselves then they would have put</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:02.319" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">own corruption and ideology aside and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.319" end="00:45:05.680" style="s2">figured out</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.560" style="s2">what person who was anywhere near the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.680" end="00:45:09.040" style="s2">democratic</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.560" end="00:45:10.880" style="s2">slate of beliefs was in the best</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.040" end="00:45:14.160" style="s2">position to defeat him in an election</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.880" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">instead they gave us an empty shirt yep</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.160" end="00:45:20.240" style="s2">actually i voted for pete boudeg in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">primary uh and not a perfect candidate</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">in my mind a little too close to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">banks for my taste</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">but very bright young time for</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">generational change</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:31.520" style="s2">uh not captured by the wokes at least he</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t then i don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.520" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">subsequently</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">a person who could think uh who wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:40.319" style="s2">afraid of science</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.119" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">uh not a bad choice but i think</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.319" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">joe was my fifth choice and i ended up</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:46.640" style="s2">supporting him</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">against bernie because the 2020 bernie</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:51.839" style="s2">was not the 2016 bernie</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:54.880" style="s2">by any means yeah but uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.839" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">uh you know not great though i will say</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.880" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s biden is not as talented</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:01.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">as or as high equality and intellect as</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.280" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">hillary clinton</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:05.839" style="s2">but on the other hand he doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">her negatives he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.839" end="00:46:09.839" style="s2">ensnarled in her you know networks of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:12.880" style="s2">soft corruption</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.839" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">and you know globalist uh elites and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.880" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">uh so i think old joe&#39;s probably got a</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">fair good chance to win</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:22.800" style="s2">well i don&#39;t know if he&#39;s gonna win i</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">will say you know what we are</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.800" end="00:46:27.680" style="s2">learning about the corruption of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:30.720" style="s2">bidens reflects exactly</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.680" end="00:46:31.920" style="s2">my concern which was that the dnc is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.720" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">influence peddling</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.920" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">operation that has controlled the party</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:42.319" style="s2">and that biden was the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">the candidate effectively chosen by the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.319" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">dnc</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">because he will change nothing and he</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">will leave their racket</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:54.319" style="s2">intact and what we are discovering from</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:57.040" style="s2">the hunter biden laptop</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.319" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">is that this is just literally the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.040" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">influence peddling is what they do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:03.920" style="s2">the fact that joe may</p>

<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">wonderful choice</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.640" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">however i will also say that the reality</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">of trump has turned out i believe to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">a lot worse</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">than the concept of trump a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">actually sounds okay but the reality of</p>

<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:04.559" style="s2">enough that uh it would seem to me</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">rather unlikely that he&#39;ll slip in again</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.559" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll see and the problem is i am now</p>

<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">and i must say as somebody living in</p>

<p begin="00:48:43.440" end="00:48:47.440" style="s2">of the rule of law i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">happens</p>

<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">what if it is if it&#39;s biden and he</p>

<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">happens to portland</p>

<p begin="00:49:02.720" end="00:49:07.119" style="s2">so here here&#39;s the problem is that what</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.119" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">is that there is a rational argument for</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:14.480" style="s2">who either lives in portland which is a</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">right there is a rational argument for</p>

<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:26.079" style="s2">now i wish i didn&#39;t have to say this i</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.559" end="00:49:27.839" style="s2">didn&#39;t vote for trump and i wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.480" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">actually trump is so terrible you have</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">an obligation to vote for biden when in</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.319" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">you and i both know that to do so is to</p>

<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">a reasonable point and it does disturb</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:55.520" style="s2">me and i will admit there were a couple</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.599" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">could i suppose imagine voting for trump</p>

<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:10.240" style="s2">no no no uh common sense uh came in and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">you know the guy is psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.240" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">disturbed uh in a very deep deep level</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">he&#39;s as i said the light finally came</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">out he&#39;s actually a pre-modern person he</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">does not live in our</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.920" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">in our times actually he&#39;s a thuggish</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:31.440" style="s2">on top of it all which is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.839" end="00:50:33.839" style="s2">thing that saved our country</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.440" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">oh there&#39;s no there&#39;s no difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.839" end="00:50:37.760" style="s2">finding arguments</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">against a vote for trump the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.760" end="00:50:41.359" style="s2">that the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">party did the one thing they needed not</p>

<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">which is to create a scenario so</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:47.839" style="s2">frightening</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">that people who would never think to</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.839" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">vote for trump are contemplating it</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">the works have con have made the problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:57.200" style="s2">more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">i mean you know soft corrupt dnc type</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:01.599" style="s2">i&#39;ll take one of those every day over</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:04.240" style="s2">trump right we&#39;ve lived with</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.599" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">soft corrupt democrats since uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.240" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">at least 1960</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">when when they get into office uh they</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:13.040" style="s2">always steal a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.440" style="s2">uh and uh hey you know that&#39;s the price</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.040" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.440" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">our less than perfect democracy but it</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">been for this woke thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">any democrat uh you know would have won</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:27.440" style="s2">by 20 points probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not just the wokes though</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.440" end="00:51:33.119" style="s2">it&#39;s the combination</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:35.599" style="s2">of the vp choice of kamala harris</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.119" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">right which is very frightening in</p>

<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:50.400" style="s2">because his advancing decrepitude makes</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">it highly likely</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.400" end="00:51:54.480" style="s2">that she will attain the office at least</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">fairly likely i will say</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.480" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">uh at least a couple of my friends who</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">fi they were lifelong republicans who</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">were considering holding their nose and</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:06.480" style="s2">voting for biden the</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:08.400" style="s2">selection of harris uh turned that off</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.480" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">uh so there&#39;s that that&#39;s also part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.400" end="00:52:11.040" style="s2">the consolation there&#39;s no doubt about</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:40.880" style="s2">as an opportunity to move</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:43.520" style="s2">america towards a more equal more just</p>

<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">there you go so the data on what he</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.880" style="s2">actually did at a policy level</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.720" style="s2">suggests that he managed the financial</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.880" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">crisis reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.720" end="00:54:10.559" style="s2">but that was accidental from the point</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">of view of the american public that what</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.559" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">he was really doing was managing the</p>

<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">well for the real constituents of</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">the duopoly and it happened that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">american public&#39;s interests were well</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">enough aligned that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:27.280" style="s2">that uh you know we had the economy</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:29.040" style="s2">preserved at some level</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.280" end="00:54:30.800" style="s2">but that was the self-interest of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.040" end="00:54:32.800" style="s2">banks kicking in and</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.800" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">you know the public was not well served</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.800" end="00:54:36.319" style="s2">by it which of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">woke a lot of people up to what was</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.319" end="00:54:40.400" style="s2">going on caused the occupy movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">uh the tea party movement in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.400" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">beginning and and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">in any case i in game b for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.160" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">right right came from that</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:53.119" style="s2">we i think we all saw the beast</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">um clearly for the first time but</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.119" end="00:54:56.960" style="s2">uh in any case yeah i do think the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:54:59.119" style="s2">answer is we always lose the election</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.960" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">sometimes we lose it worse sometimes we</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.119" end="00:55:01.920" style="s2">lose it better</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.240" end="00:55:04.880" style="s2">but the fact that we always lose it</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.920" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">because somebody else has</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.880" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">dibs on power is uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">troubling and it&#39;s time we did something</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">about it all right so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">what can be done you know let&#39;s assume</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:20.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the day after the election</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s a group of us who share your</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.000" end="00:55:24.720" style="s2">distaste for the show that we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:27.280" style="s2">year after year after year</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.720" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">and yet we&#39;re smart folks we understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.280" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">game theory</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">we understand uh evolution we understand</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">networked</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:37.119" style="s2">evolution how can we traverse</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:38.640" style="s2">these famous traps of difficulty of</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.119" end="00:55:40.559" style="s2">launching a third party or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.640" end="00:55:41.680" style="s2">third political movement that acts a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.559" end="00:55:44.319" style="s2">like a party</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.680" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">and somehow become credible over the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.319" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">next four to eight years</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">well you know i think those of us</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:54.319" style="s2">who are trying to build something that</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">captures the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.319" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">are in an unfortunate learning process</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.760" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">right we are discovering what flies and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t fly which actually has very</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:05.920" style="s2">little to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:08.000" style="s2">with what would work if only people</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.920" end="00:56:09.680" style="s2">would sign up for it in other words</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.000" end="00:56:11.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a bottleneck that comes through</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.680" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">what people can imagine and what they</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.359" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:20.559" style="s2">and i think the key recognition</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">is that a you&#39;ve got code running in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.559" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">your mind</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:24.960" style="s2">that is not there for your well-being</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s there to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.960" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">something that does not wish to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:30.400" style="s2">displaced and that our survival depends</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">on us displacing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.400" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">so finding that malware</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:38.240" style="s2">is vital and that malware lives in</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">certain places it lives</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.240" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">in the argument that you must vote for</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:43.520" style="s2">the lesser evil</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:45.520" style="s2">it lives in the argument that to vote</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.520" end="00:56:46.160" style="s2">for something other than the major party</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.520" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">offerings</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.160" end="00:56:49.920" style="s2">is throwing away your vote that a</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">protest vote is pointless</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.920" end="00:56:54.559" style="s2">right these things are wrong the reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:58.079" style="s2">that they&#39;re wrong is not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.559" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">but what you know going into</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.079" end="00:57:03.599" style="s2">it is if everybody does what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">autopilot says they must do</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.599" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">if everybody evaluates each decision</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:09.520" style="s2">locally to that decision we keep ending</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">up in the same puzzle and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.520" end="00:57:12.720" style="s2">the magnitude of the hazard grows over</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.720" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">right that&#39;s going to be a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">sooner or later if trump</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">you know scares the hell out of you and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">you think my god how could this person</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:22.799" style="s2">have ended up in such a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.799" end="00:57:26.319" style="s2">you ain&#39;t seen nothing yet it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">get worse that&#39;s guaranteed unless we</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.319" end="00:57:31.280" style="s2">figure out how to confront the problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">so what that means is something</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.280" end="00:57:35.280" style="s2">that you do not expect something that</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">sounds wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.280" end="00:57:39.760" style="s2">is going to have to carry the day now</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">what is that going to look like</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.760" end="00:57:43.680" style="s2">there are a lot of ways we could come at</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:46.960" style="s2">that problem</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.680" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">but i would say step one is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.960" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">recognition</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">that elections sit in a game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">landscape but it is not a one-off game</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:56.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">is always an iterated game and if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.480" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">are voting</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">as almost every american does on the</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">is an isolated election you&#39;re probably</p>

<p begin="00:58:04.400" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">yourself and those you care about harm</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.520" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">that the right way to think about</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">elections is iterated</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">and therefore at the point that it turns</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">out that the duopoly robs you of a</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.640" style="s2">reasonable choice</p>

<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">increases the likelihood that in the</p>

<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">that&#39;s the right thing to do but we know</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:30.079" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">you know heck you you&#39;re a professional</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.079" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">professor of this trying to teach</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">people uh evolutionary game theory is</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:37.839" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:39.040" style="s2">easy yeah and i you know i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.839" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">believe that that&#39;s the way it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">um i think there are</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">what i came to understand in the process</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.000" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">of seeing what happened with unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">and i must say we haven&#39;t even gotten to</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">what twitter did we will talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">before we go</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">but what i came to realize is that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">was the idea that a groundswell could</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:05.599" style="s2">arise directly</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">the way that a groundswell would happen</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.599" end="00:59:10.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">that one has to reach a small</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.160" end="00:59:15.359" style="s2">number of highly imaginative</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:17.920" style="s2">influential people and that they are the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.359" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">ones who really need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.920" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">enough game theory or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">very like it in order to be persuaded</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">that enough is enough and it is the time</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">to do something</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:29.839" style="s2">counter-intuitive that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">the problem is trying to reach people</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.839" end="00:59:35.040" style="s2">directly everybody is embedded</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">in a network of you know a social</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.040" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">network and i don&#39;t mean a platform i</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">mean an actual group of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">that they care about and those people</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">hold these uh stifling beliefs that one</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.160" end="00:59:49.280" style="s2">must vote for the lesser evil or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:52.559" style="s2">being stupid</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.280" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">um that a protest vote is a waste</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.559" end="00:59:57.359" style="s2">and that the thing that is going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="01:00:01.440" style="s2">cause that dynamic to break</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.359" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">is people who are smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.440" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">who are articulate who are patient who</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:08.559" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">um trusted to stand up and say</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.559" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">you know what we can&#39;t keep doing this</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">i think approaching approaching those</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">people and getting them on board over</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">time is really the key to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:19.040" style="s2">groundswell that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">going to be necessary one way or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.040" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">other it&#39;s a it&#39;s a start but here</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">let me throw back at you uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen over the history</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">the last several years we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:28.559" style="s2">pretty good network now pretty smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.559" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">right the game b emancipation party your</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">rebel wisdom uh there&#39;s uh hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">thousands of people now who are</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">uh i think aware of the issues and are</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">thinking about them</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">but there&#39;s also actual hard game theory</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">problems that we as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">and there&#39;s actual real organizing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">has to be done real work</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">right hard work extremely hard work and</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">i&#39;ve known a number of people who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">been involved libertarian party</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">and you know the number of years they</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:02.720" style="s2">had to spend until they got the capacity</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">to get on 50 state ballots year election</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.720" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">after election it took them</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">many years and it still takes them a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">million dollars every year to make that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:12.400" style="s2">happen so</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:15.200" style="s2">well before you go on let me just say</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.400" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">of course it does the duopoly has set up</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.200" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">rules</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">to prevent it from being challenged and</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:23.760" style="s2">one of the things that one has to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:27.119" style="s2">recognize is that to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.760" end="01:01:30.079" style="s2">that you think that the game is to win</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.119" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">against goliath by goliath&#39;s own rules</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:34.960" style="s2">you are very likely never to get there</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:36.640" style="s2">what one has to figure out is how you</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:38.880" style="s2">escape those rules</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.640" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">and play some game in which goliath is</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.880" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">not the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">dominant player or attack at the cracks</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:46.240" style="s2">at least to start</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:48.240" style="s2">right and again your knowledge of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.240" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">evolution you know there&#39;s little niches</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.240" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">where new things start</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">right uh and one i&#39;d like to throw out</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:56.480" style="s2">for your consideration</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">is a surprising number of particularly</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.480" end="01:02:01.359" style="s2">state legislative</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">uh races aren&#39;t actually contested uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.359" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">only one of the major parties actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">runs a candidate</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">uh and this is what i was about to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:09.839" style="s2">previously with all these</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">all these a couple hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.839" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">smart people that were</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:16.880" style="s2">uh network with uh you know being smart</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">and publishing smart essays on medium</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.880" end="01:02:20.640" style="s2">and such and cool videos on rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:22.799" style="s2">and things</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.640" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">uh you know aren&#39;t enough we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.799" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">move from ideas to action</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">and actually getting some people elected</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:32.559" style="s2">small number</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">to state legislatures on a</p>

<p begin="01:02:37.039" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">might be a way to work that crack to</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.880" end="01:02:41.520" style="s2">establish the niche to show that this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.520" end="01:02:48.480" style="s2">craziness that it can be done um i</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">i see it i&#39;m not sure i actually see the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.480" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">pathway from</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">you know uh electing a small number of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">people at the state level i just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:58.240" style="s2">think we have time</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">to go this route um but i will say one</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.240" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">of the things that i think the unity</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">did exactly right and that would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:07.280" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">for any effort going forward</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.280" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">is the discovery that the nation</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:17.920" style="s2">is in need of and ready for</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.480" end="01:03:19.200" style="s2">a non-ideological movement and that to</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.920" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">the extent</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.200" end="01:03:24.000" style="s2">that many of our fellow travelers fly</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:27.119" style="s2">under the banner of libertarian or</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.000" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">green or whatever it may be</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.119" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">that they are actually shooting</p>

<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:35.599" style="s2">and that what needs to be done is</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.039" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">whatever your ideology is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.599" end="01:03:40.319" style="s2">more important than that is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:40.960" style="s2">elimination of the corruption that has</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.319" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.960" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">our electoral system and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">you can be at opposite ends of the</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:52.319" style="s2">up on the idea of restoring</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.839" end="01:03:53.359" style="s2">the democratic republic to functional</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.319" end="01:03:55.119" style="s2">status</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.359" end="01:03:57.599" style="s2">because you believe that if the</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.599" end="01:04:04.240" style="s2">that your ideology would win out</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">and frankly all of us probably ought to</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.240" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">recognize that to the extent that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:09.520" style="s2">ideological beliefs some of them are</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:11.200" style="s2">probably accurate</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.520" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">many of them are probably not and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.200" end="01:04:17.280" style="s2">what you really want</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">is for a meritocratic evaluation of what</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.280" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">the best ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">are and an eclectic slate of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:25.760" style="s2">policy proposals and the way we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">to get there is to get the corruption</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.760" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">out of the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m a little skeptical on again</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:32.799" style="s2">mobilizing tens of millions of americans</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:35.280" style="s2">with process</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.799" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">hmm well that&#39;s not what i&#39;m saying i</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.280" end="01:04:40.319" style="s2">mean for one thing i would say</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">uh you know you say</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.319" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">having people present on rebel wisdom or</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:46.480" style="s2">write medium</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:48.319" style="s2">essays or whatever it is isn&#39;t enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.480" end="01:04:50.480" style="s2">and i fully agree but what you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.319" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">say is that the answer to the problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.480" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">is uh narrative rather than analytical</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">that the analytics have to be right but</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">that what really persuades people</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">is a story that they find compelling and</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">this is one of the things that those of</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">who are in a position to get the game</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">theory right very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:11.280" style="s2">don&#39;t get because we do tend to be quite</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">analytical and we think that the right</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.280" end="01:05:15.520" style="s2">argument should persuade people</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">and in the end the right argument</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.520" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:22.400" style="s2">is the foundation of a compelling story</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">and it is the compelling story that will</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.400" end="01:05:26.720" style="s2">allow the movement to be viable i agree</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">and in fact i quote you</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.720" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">on this actually i thought it was the</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:33.359" style="s2">most perceptive analysis of the failure</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:34.799" style="s2">mode of our old emancipation party which</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.359" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if you recall saying this</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.799" end="01:05:39.119" style="s2">but i do which is we had too many tapas</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:42.960" style="s2">jeffersons and not enough ben</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.119" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">franklin i do remember saying that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.960" end="01:05:47.039" style="s2">and that stuck with me like you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:49.039" style="s2">kicking the balls right yep that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.039" end="01:05:52.079" style="s2">we did</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.039" end="01:05:54.720" style="s2">yep yep no uh benjamin franklin uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.079" end="01:05:56.960" style="s2">you know he definitely captured the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.720" end="01:05:57.839" style="s2">imagination in a particular way and yes</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.960" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">we need uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.839" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">we need more of that yeah we need</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">storytellers interesting yep</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:05.920" style="s2">well i&#39;m i&#39;m very interested in seeing</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:06.640" style="s2">what you do i&#39;m a little skeptical on</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.920" end="01:06:09.839" style="s2">that a</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.640" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">a new uh party or a new</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.839" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">something like a party can be mostly</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">process oriented i&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:17.359" style="s2">do believe we&#39;re gonna have to stick</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">some uh flags in the ground on some of</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">the big issues of the day</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">uh but you know they don&#39;t have to be in</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:24.000" style="s2">the conventional fashions</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:26.240" style="s2">another one that strikes me as i was</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.000" end="01:06:28.000" style="s2">just fooling around with the nolan graph</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.240" end="01:06:30.240" style="s2">you know the for the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.000" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">two axis system it struck me that</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.240" end="01:06:34.559" style="s2">there&#39;s perhaps an interesting and</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:35.359" style="s2">curious space that&#39;s not being occupied</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.559" end="01:06:38.559" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.359" end="01:06:41.760" style="s2">uh which is an odd hybrid of both</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.559" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">less government and more equality</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.760" end="01:06:45.359" style="s2">uh spell that out a little bit yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">know for instance</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.359" end="01:06:49.039" style="s2">uh you know one of the things that at</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:51.200" style="s2">least strikes me as</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.039" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">clearly wrong with our society is the</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.200" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">ever-growing inequality at</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">exponential rates right through the</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">financial crisis</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:06:59.520" style="s2">accelerating through the obama</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">administration</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.520" end="01:07:05.920" style="s2">getting worse uh under trump etc</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:08.799" style="s2">uh and uh when and you know that drives</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.920" end="01:07:09.520" style="s2">the left at some level uh but also you</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.799" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.520" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">drove the trump voters at least a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:16.640" style="s2">the ones that i&#39;ve i&#39;ve talked to</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.520" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">and there has been since 1980</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.640" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">a general distaste for bureaucracy and</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.200" style="s2">and more programs as they answered every</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:26.319" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">and so roughly speaking i</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.319" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">crafted a concept which i call</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:33.599" style="s2">parametric social democracy</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:34.640" style="s2">uh you say what the hell is that uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:36.400" style="s2">definitely a jefferson</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.640" end="01:07:37.760" style="s2">thomas jefferson kind of thing not a ben</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.400" end="01:07:39.520" style="s2">franklin kind of thing and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.760" end="01:07:41.440" style="s2">well turn that over to somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.520" end="01:07:45.119" style="s2">come up with a better name the idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.440" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">is to take a relatively small number of</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.119" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">parameters that make a big impact in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">world but don&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">a large government bureaucracy to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">now i&#39;ll just run through a quick list</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">of them fully portable</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:00.720" style="s2">educational vouchers right uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:02.000" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily need to spend any more</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.720" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">money on education we actually spend</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.000" end="01:08:04.799" style="s2">more money on education than most</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">advanced countries do</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:07.920" style="s2">and get a lot worse results uh but if we</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:10.319" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.920" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">uh all that all that money turned into</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.319" end="01:08:14.640" style="s2">personal vouchers for every student</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:16.080" style="s2">there would be a tremendous ability for</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.080" end="01:08:19.920" style="s2">uh to create better schools and to fund</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.920" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">for those who wanted to use public</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.040" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">but they wouldn&#39;t be these uh relatively</p>

<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:30.319" style="s2">uh politically captured institutions</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.040" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">that we have today</p>

<p begin="01:09:25.120" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">negative carbon but here&#39;s the key right</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.319" end="01:09:31.520" style="s2">rather than having that be another</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">source of money for the government it</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.520" end="01:09:35.520" style="s2">should be recycled to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:36.640" style="s2">per capita and you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.520" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">people say wait a minute</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.640" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that mean there&#39;s no incentive</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.159" end="01:09:42.400" style="s2">wrong every time you make an incentive</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:45.040" style="s2">a decision to purchase something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.400" end="01:09:46.640" style="s2">carbon containing you pay the price</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.040" end="01:09:48.239" style="s2">if you spend your money on something</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.640" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">else you don&#39;t pay the price</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.239" end="01:09:53.440" style="s2">you get the same dividend back from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">recycling of the proceeds per capita</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.440" end="01:09:56.800" style="s2">so if you are spending less carbon than</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:59.280" style="s2">average</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.800" end="01:10:01.760" style="s2">you make money off the tax only people</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.280" end="01:10:03.679" style="s2">that are spending more carbon per capita</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.760" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">actually pay a net tax and yet every</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.679" end="01:10:08.719" style="s2">single decision about carbon</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">is fully impacted by the uh by the power</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.719" end="01:10:12.320" style="s2">of the tax</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:13.520" style="s2">so obvious to me as the way to go and</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.320" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">yet neither party</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.520" end="01:10:17.600" style="s2">has embraced it yeah but why why jim you</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:19.520" style="s2">know the answer</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.600" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">taxes for the republicans they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.520" end="01:10:23.360" style="s2">have the tax words</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:24.000" style="s2">no it&#39;s the corruption the energy</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.360" end="01:10:25.600" style="s2">companies</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.000" end="01:10:27.280" style="s2">have corrupted both parties no doubt</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.600" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">about that right the energy companies</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">and the health care companies</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">and they are the reason that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.320" style="s2">uh inequality that you point to is</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">growing</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.320" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">uh exponentially right this is all</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:45.679" style="s2">downstream of a system that basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:47.920" style="s2">creates advantage for those who have</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.679" end="01:10:52.640" style="s2">political power it&#39;s the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">um the money on money returns as you say</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.640" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">yeah the classic man and the last one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:11:00.560" style="s2">course which exemplifies this</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:11:02.159" style="s2">is uh a ubi universal basic income which</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.560" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">hey we invented people we called it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.159" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">citizenship wage in 1987</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">2013 uh could be funded by the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">combination of a vat tax</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:13.199" style="s2">a wealth tax and the elimination of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:16.320" style="s2">other welfare systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.199" end="01:11:17.440" style="s2">uh but of course huge vested interests</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">opposed to it</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.440" end="01:11:21.280" style="s2">but if we had a party that was not</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:22.800" style="s2">captured and i don&#39;t think we&#39;d build a</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.280" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">party that was captured would we now</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.800" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">brett</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">no no certainly not and that was we</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:28.400" style="s2">would say from day one we are here for</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:30.960" style="s2">the american people</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.400" end="01:11:31.920" style="s2">and we can get more equality and less</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.960" end="01:11:35.120" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">by powerful parametric changes in how we</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.120" end="01:11:38.159" style="s2">operate our system</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">and because we&#39;re not corrupt we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.159" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">going to push these things even though</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:44.560" style="s2">gores the bowl of some rich and powerful</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:46.719" style="s2">vested interest</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.560" end="01:11:48.000" style="s2">yeah now the question is do you need to</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.719" end="01:11:52.080" style="s2">divorce</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.000" end="01:11:55.120" style="s2">these particular policy objectives</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.080" end="01:11:58.400" style="s2">from a force that unites us all</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.120" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">to oust the duopoly or could you</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.400" end="01:12:01.040" style="s2">conceivably do what i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">suggesting</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.040" end="01:12:05.360" style="s2">which is that you make those one effort</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">my guess is if you make them one effort</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.360" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">you&#39;ll lose</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">yeah there is a problem which is that</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">our current tribal alignments will</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">continue to attract people</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">uh because of disagreements with some of</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:19.600" style="s2">the things in the package</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:19.920" style="s2">yep however uh i&#39;m not sure i think we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.600" end="01:12:23.040" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.920" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">focus group it polling do it et cetera i</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.040" end="01:12:25.040" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">more confidence in that frankly though</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.040" end="01:12:28.080" style="s2">than a you know pure process</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:29.840" style="s2">approach oh we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.080" end="01:12:32.320" style="s2">for good government uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.840" end="01:12:33.840" style="s2">rank choice or range choice voting maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.320" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.840" end="01:12:37.920" style="s2">uh and some improvements in how uh</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.080" end="01:12:39.760" style="s2">congress is administrated i can see</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.920" end="01:12:41.679" style="s2">people&#39;s eyeballs rolling back uh pretty</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.760" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">quickly if we try to pedal that as the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.679" end="01:12:45.440" style="s2">as the core of the opportunity well i</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.760" end="01:12:48.840" style="s2">see i see there is another</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.440" end="01:12:52.400" style="s2">possibility i would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.840" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">we actually have discovered</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.400" end="01:12:58.239" style="s2">the best possible state</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:59.120" style="s2">for our system we&#39;ve spelled it out</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.239" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve never come</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.120" end="01:13:02.159" style="s2">close to attaining it but we know what</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">it contains</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.159" end="01:13:06.000" style="s2">and what we are fiercely divided over to</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">the extent that our disagreements are</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.000" end="01:13:11.840" style="s2">not about corruption but they are about</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:14.400" style="s2">honest uh different perspectives</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.840" end="01:13:16.960" style="s2">what we&#39;re actually divided over is how</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.400" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">close we are to the objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.960" end="01:13:23.280" style="s2">what remedies would be worth their</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.719" style="s2">cost and hazard to get us closer to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:28.880" style="s2">objective</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.719" end="01:13:32.000" style="s2">and that in effect if we spelled out</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.880" end="01:13:32.560" style="s2">the things that we actually agree on you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.000" end="01:13:36.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">decent people all agree that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.000" end="01:13:39.920" style="s2">opportunity ought to be broadly</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">distributed and that</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.920" end="01:13:43.440" style="s2">there ought to be no bias in the market</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:46.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.440" end="01:13:49.520" style="s2">favors one group over another right</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.800" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">so if we spelled out the meta level of</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.520" end="01:13:52.719" style="s2">what the</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">the goal that you ought to unite all</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.719" end="01:13:57.199" style="s2">americans is</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:13:58.880" style="s2">and we spelled out that the primary</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.199" end="01:14:01.600" style="s2">obstacle to it</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.880" end="01:14:02.560" style="s2">was the corruption of our system but we</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.600" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.560" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">the ideological aspects aside</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">so that people could um battle that out</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:15.440" style="s2">later when the system</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:17.840" style="s2">was free uh free of corruption enough</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.440" end="01:14:19.360" style="s2">that those discussions could be had in</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.840" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">an honest context</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.360" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">that we might have the best of both</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:25.199" style="s2">worlds that&#39;s interesting i like</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:27.360" style="s2">i think i like that we&#39;d have to see if</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.199" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">one could craft a list of such</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.360" end="01:14:31.840" style="s2">values that was rich enough to not be</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:34.000" style="s2">banal</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.840" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">and uh yet at the same time wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.000" end="01:14:37.920" style="s2">overly determining</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:39.120" style="s2">and tilting the party to the to the red</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.920" end="01:14:41.520" style="s2">or the blue</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.120" end="01:14:42.880" style="s2">uh my thought is that actually and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.520" end="01:14:44.960" style="s2">must say i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.880" end="01:14:46.000" style="s2">lived now for a number of years as</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.960" end="01:14:49.520" style="s2">neither fish nor</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.000" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">foul um you know i&#39;m a liberal</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.520" end="01:14:54.719" style="s2">but i&#39;m embraced more frequently over on</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.320" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">the conservative side</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.719" end="01:14:58.880" style="s2">so i&#39;ve spent a lot of time talking to</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:01.040" style="s2">people and my sense is that actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.880" end="01:15:02.480" style="s2">that picture of what decent americans</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.040" end="01:15:05.040" style="s2">really want</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.480" end="01:15:07.440" style="s2">is readily paintable and it resonates</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.040" end="01:15:10.560" style="s2">very very well</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.440" end="01:15:12.000" style="s2">and that people actually are relieved to</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.560" end="01:15:13.920" style="s2">discover</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.000" end="01:15:15.040" style="s2">that they don&#39;t really differ over the</p>

<p begin="01:15:31.040" end="01:15:34.080" style="s2">that&#39;s worth pursuing i can see that it</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.199" end="01:15:36.159" style="s2">avoids</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.080" end="01:15:37.440" style="s2">a trap that comes from being specific on</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.880" end="01:15:47.920" style="s2">as well because people say all right how</p>

<p begin="01:17:20.640" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">the movement at articles of unity</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">was suspended again no explanation</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">back channel discussion actually with</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">jack of twitter revealed</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:40.719" style="s2">that we were accused of having</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:43.120" style="s2">registered a large number i believe he</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.719" end="01:17:45.760" style="s2">said 50 accounts</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.120" end="01:17:47.360" style="s2">for the express purpose of amplifying</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.760" end="01:17:49.760" style="s2">the hashtag</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.360" end="01:17:51.360" style="s2">falsely now this shocked us because we</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.760" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">had not registered any accounts</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.360" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">for that purpose people were using their</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:57.120" style="s2">own accounts for it we were using our</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.960" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">official account</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.120" end="01:18:03.280" style="s2">for it um what we discovered in</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:04.719" style="s2">a an extensive internal investigation</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.280" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">that we conducted was that there was no</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.719" end="01:18:09.040" style="s2">truth whatsoever to</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:12.640" style="s2">what twitter was saying what there was</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.040" end="01:18:13.280" style="s2">were a large number i say a large number</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.640" end="01:18:16.400" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.280" end="01:18:19.520" style="s2">a dozen or slightly more than that</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.400" end="01:18:23.520" style="s2">dedicated accounts that were opposed</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.520" end="01:18:25.760" style="s2">to the unity movement who reported us</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.520" end="01:18:27.840" style="s2">claiming that we were violating terms of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:30.080" style="s2">service which we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.840" end="01:18:32.400" style="s2">the shocking thing though is that not</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.080" end="01:18:35.600" style="s2">only did twitter suspend us</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.400" end="01:18:37.760" style="s2">and accuse us privately and unofficially</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.600" end="01:18:39.600" style="s2">of behavior that we didn&#39;t engage in but</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.760" end="01:18:40.080" style="s2">the account remains suspended to this</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.600" end="01:18:43.280" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.080" end="01:18:45.040" style="s2">there has been no opportunity to appeal</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.280" end="01:18:46.320" style="s2">there has been no official explanation</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.040" end="01:18:48.480" style="s2">there has been no ability</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.320" end="01:18:49.600" style="s2">to look at whatever evidence twitter</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.480" end="01:18:52.480" style="s2">thinks it has</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.600" end="01:18:53.679" style="s2">the the link is just uh the account is</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.480" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">just simply</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.679" end="01:19:01.600" style="s2">dead what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:19:05.440" style="s2">during this episode twitter</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.600" end="01:19:10.960" style="s2">created some kind of algorithm that</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.440" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">spotted posting of a link to our website</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.960" end="01:19:15.040" style="s2">and prevented the tweet from going in</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">other words the</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.040" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">link declared the website dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">or in some danger of doing harm and</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:27.440" style="s2">prevented a person</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:30.560" style="s2">from tweeting those links jack</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.440" end="01:19:34.400" style="s2">privately admitted that this was uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.560" end="01:19:37.280" style="s2">unacceptable and that was reversed</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.400" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">but to this day if you attempt to link</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.280" end="01:19:42.719" style="s2">to our website</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:45.440" style="s2">in a twitter dm you as the person</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.719" end="01:19:47.840" style="s2">dming the link will see it as normal the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.440" end="01:19:49.920" style="s2">person that you send the link to</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.840" end="01:19:51.760" style="s2">will see a warning instead that will</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.920" end="01:19:52.719" style="s2">hide the website and declare it</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.760" end="01:19:55.679" style="s2">suspicious</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.719" end="01:19:57.440" style="s2">and possibly harmful so twitter has</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.679" end="01:20:00.159" style="s2">pulled out the big guns</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.440" end="01:20:01.040" style="s2">to oppose the unity movement on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.159" end="01:20:03.360" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.040" end="01:20:05.199" style="s2">it seems of false accusations from</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.360" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.199" end="01:20:08.880" style="s2">dislike the unity movement and with no</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:11.120" style="s2">evidence of wrongdoing</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.880" end="01:20:12.960" style="s2">we know that there was none because we</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.120" end="01:20:15.679" style="s2">went through the effort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.960" end="01:20:17.440" style="s2">doing a thorough investigation but you</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.679" end="01:20:18.560" style="s2">know as one discovers with these</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.440" end="01:20:20.080" style="s2">platforms</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.560" end="01:20:22.320" style="s2">once they decide you&#39;re guilty of</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.080" end="01:20:25.199" style="s2">something there&#39;s just simply</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.320" end="01:20:26.080" style="s2">no opportunity for redress yeah this</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.199" end="01:20:29.120" style="s2">strike to me is</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.080" end="01:20:31.520" style="s2">a considerably more disturbing</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.120" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">pattern than the uh than you getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.520" end="01:20:33.840" style="s2">booted off facebook and then brought</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.120" end="01:20:36.080" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.840" end="01:20:38.800" style="s2">quickly uh i mean this is even more</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.080" end="01:20:41.760" style="s2">deeply orwellian and kafka-esque</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.800" end="01:20:44.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s quite clear</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.760" end="01:20:47.600" style="s2">what it is and the very fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.400" end="01:20:50.000" style="s2">uh movement that they opposed is one</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:53.360" style="s2">that is challenging the duopoly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.000" end="01:20:57.120" style="s2">obviously motivated by proper</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:59.040" style="s2">patriotic democratic values the audacity</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.120" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">to challenge such a movement even if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.040" end="01:21:04.159" style="s2">think it&#39;s wrong-headed</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">right this is the united states we</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.159" end="01:21:09.760" style="s2">are allowed to to challenge</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:10.960" style="s2">perceived corruption in our governmental</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:12.800" style="s2">structure this</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.960" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">in fact it&#39;s our patriotic duty to see</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.800" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">to do it if we see it</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:17.360" style="s2">and to have twitter decide that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:18.480" style="s2">have the right to do that on their</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.360" end="01:21:20.800" style="s2">platform is really</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.480" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">jaw-dropping yep and for uh people out</p>

<p begin="01:21:37.679" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">uh so what the right</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.880" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s uh very disturbing</p>

<p begin="01:21:47.440" end="01:21:50.560" style="s2">and it was interesting when we were the</p>

<p begin="01:21:54.840" end="01:21:58.800" style="s2">decision uh we turned up dozens of</p>

<p begin="01:22:09.040" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">they had no right to appeal</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.880" end="01:22:15.920" style="s2">uh and unfortunately they didn&#39;t have uh</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.000" end="01:22:17.360" style="s2">you know a large mob that could be</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.920" end="01:22:20.159" style="s2">stirred up on their behalf</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.360" end="01:22:22.320" style="s2">and they were just yep i i agree</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.159" end="01:22:22.719" style="s2">many of them contacted me and said this</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.320" end="01:22:24.080" style="s2">and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.719" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">not really in a position i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.080" end="01:22:26.880" style="s2">know what to do with it because i of</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:28.880" style="s2">course can&#39;t evaluate whether they were</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.880" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">tossed off for some reason or not</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.880" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">but yes this appears to have happened to</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:34.400" style="s2">a large number of people</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:35.360" style="s2">i&#39;m in the lucky position of being able</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.400" end="01:22:37.360" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.360" end="01:22:39.199" style="s2">create enough noise and my friends</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.360" end="01:22:40.880" style="s2">create enough noise to get it reversed</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.199" end="01:22:44.639" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.880" end="01:22:48.560" style="s2">it&#39;s very clearly a hazard to to regular</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.639" end="01:22:52.080" style="s2">folks and we ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.560" end="01:22:55.920" style="s2">quite alarmed at it seems like this is</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.080" end="01:22:59.040" style="s2">an excellent process uh proposal for</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.920" end="01:22:59.440" style="s2">what comes next politically right uh you</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.040" end="01:23:02.159" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.440" end="01:23:03.120" style="s2">to essentially find some means by which</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.159" end="01:23:05.360" style="s2">due process</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.120" end="01:23:06.320" style="s2">and transparency must be given in these</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.360" end="01:23:08.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.320" end="01:23:10.560" style="s2">yeah i mean one of two things has to be</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.480" end="01:23:11.360" style="s2">true either there has to be a public</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.560" end="01:23:13.760" style="s2">on-ramp</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.360" end="01:23:15.840" style="s2">to the internet so that we can have</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.760" end="01:23:18.639" style="s2">platforms in which this is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.840" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">uh a possibility because we do have free</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.639" end="01:23:22.560" style="s2">speech protections or</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:24.960" style="s2">protections that are up to date for the</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.560" end="01:23:26.480" style="s2">21st century have to be generated and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.960" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">they have to apply to these platforms</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.480" end="01:23:31.760" style="s2">because at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:34.639" style="s2">we have the founders worst nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.760" end="01:23:35.679" style="s2">of a situation in which we cannot openly</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.639" end="01:23:38.960" style="s2">discuss</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.679" end="01:23:42.239" style="s2">the political situation of the day</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.960" end="01:23:44.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s unfolding because we are now in</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.239" end="01:23:46.000" style="s2">a position of discussing these things</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.320" end="01:23:48.159" style="s2">in a technological venue that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.000" end="01:23:50.800" style="s2">founders couldn&#39;t possibly foresee</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.159" end="01:23:52.239" style="s2">and yet clearly fits the role of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.800" end="01:23:54.239" style="s2">public square</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.239" end="01:23:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s the public square it&#39;s the public</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.239" end="01:24:00.880" style="s2">square you know to the 10th power</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.080" end="01:24:02.080" style="s2">but you know we have to address this one</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.880" end="01:24:03.679" style="s2">way or the other there has to be a</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.080" end="01:24:04.159" style="s2">public square in which our rights to</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.679" end="01:24:06.800" style="s2">discuss</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.159" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">things are guaranteed i&#39;d suggest that</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.800" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:10.560" style="s2">uh one of the core things that ought to</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:11.520" style="s2">be on this new political movement saying</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.560" end="01:24:13.520" style="s2">here&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.520" end="01:24:15.360" style="s2">uh here&#39;s what needs to be fixed and</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.520" end="01:24:16.000" style="s2">whether we go and actually say how that</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.360" end="01:24:19.360" style="s2">would be another</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.000" end="01:24:20.560" style="s2">question uh but uh at a minimum should</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.360" end="01:24:22.480" style="s2">lay out the problem</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.560" end="01:24:23.360" style="s2">very clearly because unfortunately as</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.480" end="01:24:25.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;re trying to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.360" end="01:24:27.360" style="s2">unity 2020 movement</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.280" end="01:24:30.400" style="s2">this is an issue that affects both the</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.360" end="01:24:32.400" style="s2">right and the left right uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.400" end="01:24:34.080" style="s2">these guys go after all kinds of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.400" end="01:24:35.520" style="s2">they don&#39;t like uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.080" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">if this faction on the left they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.520" end="01:24:38.560" style="s2">like they go after them you know people</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:39.840" style="s2">on the right they go after them people</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.560" end="01:24:40.960" style="s2">in the middle like you they go after</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.840" end="01:24:42.719" style="s2">them so this is</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.960" end="01:24:44.639" style="s2">uh well probably there&#39;s a political</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.719" end="01:24:45.280" style="s2">bias in it i would suspect there is at</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.639" end="01:24:47.920" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.280" end="01:24:48.800" style="s2">uh in reality they&#39;re also hammering all</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.920" end="01:24:51.120" style="s2">kinds of people</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.800" end="01:24:51.840" style="s2">uh some of it more or less randomly or</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.120" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.840" end="01:24:55.040" style="s2">i guess it&#39;s not really random because</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:57.520" style="s2">anyone who challenges the stan</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.040" end="01:24:58.719" style="s2">status quo these are become a force for</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.520" end="01:25:00.960" style="s2">the status quo</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.719" end="01:25:03.600" style="s2">which is remarkably annoying since these</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.960" end="01:25:04.639" style="s2">were uh you know revolutionary upstarts</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.600" end="01:25:06.080" style="s2">not that long ago</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.639" end="01:25:08.159" style="s2">in silicon valley that were trying to</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.080" end="01:25:11.199" style="s2">change the world 100</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.159" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">agree but now they&#39;ve been captured by</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.199" end="01:25:15.199" style="s2">making the big mistake i go in public</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.600" end="01:25:17.360" style="s2">and you know going to</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.199" end="01:25:18.800" style="s2">davos and places i was invited davos</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.360" end="01:25:19.440" style="s2">once i told them go themselves</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.800" end="01:25:21.040" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.440" end="01:25:22.719" style="s2">uh i&#39;m going to go hang out they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.040" end="01:25:25.040" style="s2"> right but</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.719" end="01:25:27.199" style="s2">you know these guys do they go to davos</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.040" end="01:25:29.520" style="s2">and they have sold out</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.199" end="01:25:31.120" style="s2">so whether it&#39;s via building a</p>

<p begin="01:25:32.400" end="01:25:35.600" style="s2">difficult but again not impossible</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.320" end="01:25:36.560" style="s2">probably easier than starting a third</p>

<p begin="01:25:36.560" end="01:25:40.400" style="s2">or via government regulation we must</p>

<p begin="01:25:40.400" end="01:25:43.840" style="s2">honest public square there can be little</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.000" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">doubt about that in my mind</p>
