<p begin="00:00:00.475" end="00:00:03.135" style="s2">Dave and I are here today to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.135" end="00:00:05.465" style="s2"> about Patreon, I&#39;ll start.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.465" end="00:00:08.480" style="s2"> We exchanged many emails</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:11.300" style="s2"> with all the people in our business</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.300" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2"> network and no one is happy with things</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:17.040" style="s2"> which happen so we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.440" end="00:00:19.815" style="s2"> think of other options and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.815" end="00:00:22.535" style="s2"> checked SubscribeStar but it seems</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.535" end="00:00:24.935" style="s2"> that PayPal decided to stop funding them</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.935" end="00:00:27.555" style="s2"> so the transition to an alternative platform,</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.095" end="00:00:31.225" style="s2"> an alternative commercial platform that</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.225" end="00:00:33.805" style="s2"> is out of our control, out of our control it doesn&#39;t make it sustainable,</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.960" end="00:00:37.580" style="s2"> so Dave, why don&#39;t you explain what we talked about today.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.580" end="00:00:39.645" style="s2"> Yes, well I think so first</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.645" end="00:00:42.685" style="s2"> it should be made clear to everyone how much</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.685" end="00:00:45.695" style="s2"> is significant what happened to Carl</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.695" end="00:00:47.925" style="s2"> Benjamin, Sargon of Akkad,</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.925" end="00:00:51.340" style="s2"> it doesn&#39;t matter what you think of him or whether you agree with him or anything like that,</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.900" end="00:00:54.920" style="s2"> but to ban him for something he did</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.920" end="00:00:57.040" style="s2"> van Patreon&#39;s platform,</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.040" end="00:00:59.700" style="s2"> which wasn&#39;t even on his channel,</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.700" end="00:01:02.660" style="s2"> because of the word he said and used</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.660" end="00:01:05.875" style="s2"> against the alternative right or neo-Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2"> or whatever you want to call them,</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:12.520" style="s2"> it is a huge shift in the boundaries of what is acceptable</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.525" end="00:01:15.335" style="s2"> and now we can have various discussions and we have had them,</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.335" end="00:01:18.345" style="s2"> where the boundaries should be and whether they should exist at all but</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.345" end="00:01:21.205" style="s2"> is the fact that this man was thrown out just like that,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.205" end="00:01:24.015" style="s2"> no questions, no warnings,</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.545" end="00:01:26.945" style="s2"> and this is just an extension</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.945" end="00:01:28.715" style="s2"> everything we talked about.</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.715" end="00:01:31.265" style="s2"> Also, given that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.265" end="00:01:34.575" style="s2"> that he did not violate Patreon&#39;s rules,</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.575" end="00:01:37.515" style="s2"> the ones they set up and about which you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.515" end="00:01:40.425" style="s2"> talked to Conte as well as about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.425" end="00:01:43.355" style="s2"> that it won&#39;t happen and that Patreon didn&#39;t answer this well ...</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.355" end="00:01:46.445" style="s2"> Well, look, Jack Conte came in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.445" end="00:01:49.395" style="s2"> my studio, in my house and said,</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.395" end="00:01:51.565" style="s2"> he uttered a phrase I had never heard before,</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.565" end="00:01:54.575" style="s2"> maybe you are, &#39;manifest observable behavior&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.575" end="00:01:57.405" style="s2"> you haven&#39;t heard this phrase before, have you?</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.405" end="00:02:00.200" style="s2"> alone that this is just something I missed, well</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.300" end="00:02:03.660" style="s2"> now of course &#39;manifest observable behavior, MOB mob (crowd), I think,</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.725" end="00:02:05.495" style="s2"> that&#39;s it, how nice, but</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.055" end="00:02:09.055" style="s2"> but the point is that it had to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.055" end="00:02:11.845" style="s2"> regarding conduct and then in their Terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.845" end="00:02:14.075" style="s2"> usage must also be related to something that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.565" end="00:02:17.105" style="s2"> on the platform so it is on every border</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.105" end="00:02:19.945" style="s2"> of what should be permissible Patreon scheduled and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.515" end="00:02:23.735" style="s2"> they put us in a position where, you know, I said,</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.740" end="00:02:26.125" style="s2"> I called you last Saturday when this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.125" end="00:02:29.180" style="s2"> it really took off and I told you to Patreon</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.180" end="00:02:32.215" style="s2"> makes up about 65 to 70% of my income, I now have a firm</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.215" end="00:02:35.225" style="s2"> with full-time, part-time employees,</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.225" end="00:02:38.275" style="s2"> and I was actually thinking of deleting it right away,</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.275" end="00:02:40.555" style="s2"> and no normal person would, no businessman</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.555" end="00:02:43.415" style="s2"> I wouldn&#39;t do that and I took a lot of risks</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.415" end="00:02:46.385" style="s2"> in the past, you know, before I was on Patreon</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.385" end="00:02:49.205" style="s2"> I was on Ora TV with my producer and director,</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.205" end="00:02:52.225" style="s2"> we all quit, lost health insurance, all that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.225" end="00:02:55.255" style="s2"> to get to Patreon means I like to take risks</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.275" end="00:02:57.675" style="s2"> but then I realized, well, we need to have some plan</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.675" end="00:03:00.335" style="s2"> and that’s actually why we do this. Well, we would go</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.335" end="00:03:02.485" style="s2"> and faster but, well,</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.485" end="00:03:05.595" style="s2"> i opened an account on SubscribeStar but I never did</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.595" end="00:03:07.165" style="s2"> to the end adjusted in part because</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.165" end="00:03:10.575" style="s2"> SubscribeStar seemed to start decaying almost immediately,</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.575" end="00:03:13.675" style="s2"> they attacked them, and the same was not clear,</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.675" end="00:03:16.775" style="s2"> I have read their Terms of Use and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.775" end="00:03:19.215" style="s2"> and it was not clear whether we would just go again</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.215" end="00:03:20.555" style="s2"> find in an identical situation,</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.555" end="00:03:22.775" style="s2"> and you can only make so many mistakes before</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.780" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2"> but as these mistakes become fatal,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:28.320" style="s2"> so we came to one seriously and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.320" end="00:03:30.955" style="s2"> stable solution, I worked</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.955" end="00:03:33.565" style="s2"> on it for months, literally months,</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.565" end="00:03:36.715" style="s2"> I have been working on the system for six months now</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.715" end="00:03:39.955" style="s2"> which will allow authors and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.000" end="00:03:43.500" style="s2"> to other people who publicly discuss intellectual topics</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.500" end="00:03:45.540" style="s2"> to connect more efficiently</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.540" end="00:03:48.960" style="s2"> with its readers, viewers,</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.960" end="00:03:51.160" style="s2"> and listeners, and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.160" end="00:03:53.600" style="s2"> this week it occurred to me that, along with some</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.600" end="00:03:55.895" style="s2"> change can be achieved</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.895" end="00:03:58.645" style="s2"> exactly what we hope he can achieve</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.645" end="00:04:00.685" style="s2"> so we&#39;ll try it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.685" end="00:04:03.555" style="s2"> do as quickly as possible, establish a system</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.555" end="00:04:06.625" style="s2"> on a subscription model similar to Patreon&#39;s,</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.625" end="00:04:09.165" style="s2"> there will be a lot of additional functionalities that I don&#39;t want to talk about now</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.165" end="00:04:12.505" style="s2"> and I don&#39;t want to promise too much but the system is,</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.505" end="00:04:15.355" style="s2"> because the system is new</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.725" end="00:04:18.635" style="s2"> but we will try to run it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.635" end="00:04:20.665" style="s2"> as soon as possible,</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.665" end="00:04:23.005" style="s2"> we have a lot of people who are interested,</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.005" end="00:04:26.005" style="s2"> hypothetically interested in changing the platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.005" end="00:04:28.965" style="s2"> for contribution payments. Dave and I.</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.965" end="00:04:30.955" style="s2"> we plan to do this very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.955" end="00:04:33.675" style="s2"> as soon as we find a smart way,</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.755" end="00:04:36.045" style="s2"> so ... And you know, by the way,</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.045" end="00:04:39.195" style="s2"> one of the interesting things we didn’t talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.195" end="00:04:42.255" style="s2"> but I guess we had similar experiences, the amount of emails</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.255" end="00:04:45.105" style="s2"> which I received and of course tweets and everything else but</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.105" end="00:04:47.825" style="s2"> mostly e-mails from developers, investors,</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.825" end="00:04:50.965" style="s2"> ordinary people, engineers, I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.965" end="00:04:54.305" style="s2"> everyone says that&#39;s it, because you know what the problems are</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.305" end="00:04:56.665" style="s2"> with free speech,</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.665" end="00:04:59.665" style="s2"> you don’t want to swing too soon, before you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.665" end="00:05:02.735" style="s2"> the problem reached a critical mass, but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.735" end="00:05:05.645" style="s2"> you will most likely swing too late, the lines will be like that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.645" end="00:05:08.705" style="s2"> far from being maybe out of it and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.705" end="00:05:11.175" style="s2"> I think this is so interesting because, Carl</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.475" end="00:05:14.375" style="s2"> is five or six years ago,</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.375" end="00:05:17.435" style="s2"> when I started to see what was going on in the left and of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.435" end="00:05:20.265" style="s2"> the whole thing about free speech, everyone told me you have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.265" end="00:05:23.345" style="s2"> with Sargon of Akkad, it is the man who</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.345" end="00:05:25.415" style="s2"> was a step ahead of all this ...</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.415" end="00:05:28.045" style="s2"> Sargon was great and helped me a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.045" end="00:05:31.135" style="s2"> when they just started attacking me,</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.135" end="00:05:34.255" style="s2"> you know he is a brave man, and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.255" end="00:05:37.125" style="s2"> what Patreon did to him was a real mistake</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.125" end="00:05:40.175" style="s2"> And, like I said everyone in our network are strong</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.175" end="00:05:42.745" style="s2"> upset about it, we exchange emails</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.745" end="00:05:45.805" style="s2"> with some 30 to 40 people</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.805" end="00:05:48.845" style="s2"> and, as Dave said earlier, we wanted to shoot this video today</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.845" end="00:05:52.055" style="s2"> to inform all of you we are talking to, yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.335" end="00:05:55.515" style="s2"> we haven&#39;t given up on this,</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.515" end="00:05:56.975" style="s2"> indeed, people</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.975" end="00:06:00.025" style="s2"> trying to find ways to stop this from happening as well</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.025" end="00:06:03.195" style="s2"> and we have a good plan and</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.405" end="00:06:06.335" style="s2"> we will try to implement it as soon as possible so</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.335" end="00:06:09.325" style="s2"> I would ask all of you who are listening to this to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.595" end="00:06:12.635" style="s2"> reasonably patient, I guess we&#39;ll need it</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.635" end="00:06:14.775" style="s2"> about a week to a month</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:17.595" style="s2"> to sort this all out, we&#39;ll do our best to finish something</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:20.205" style="s2"> next week, hopefully before Christmas, and if</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.205" end="00:06:21.875" style="s2"> we fail, it’s because</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.875" end="00:06:24.545" style="s2"> with things like this they are always possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.545" end="00:06:27.555" style="s2"> technical problems that arise unforeseen</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.555" end="00:06:30.605" style="s2"> but I don&#39;t want you to have the impression that</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.605" end="00:06:33.635" style="s2"> we take this lightly or retreat</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.635" end="00:06:36.595" style="s2"> and not to look for a permanent one</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.605" end="00:06:39.635" style="s2"> an alternative because we’re looking for it, and I think we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.635" end="00:06:43.005" style="s2"> a better alternative and that is our plan.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.005" end="00:06:45.975" style="s2"> Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to say, and I would add more</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.975" end="00:06:48.525" style="s2"> that we were waiting for the right moment, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.525" end="00:06:51.365" style="s2"> we watched this door slowly close for all of us,</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.365" end="00:06:54.075" style="s2"> whether it&#39;s Twitter or Facebook,</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.075" end="00:06:57.485" style="s2"> when they ban, when they secretly ban, the processing of earnings, and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.935" end="00:07:01.015" style="s2"> and we take this very seriously, and of course</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.015" end="00:07:04.025" style="s2"> you know that Jordan, who works harder than anyone else in this world,</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.025" end="00:07:06.845" style="s2"> somehow managed and partly to build a platform</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.845" end="00:07:09.825" style="s2"> during this year in spite of everything else.</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.825" end="00:07:12.085" style="s2"> I knew, we knew this</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.085" end="00:07:15.105" style="s2"> lurking in the background and will become a problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.105" end="00:07:17.925" style="s2"> and Dave, you spent a lot of time talking to</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.925" end="00:07:19.775" style="s2"> investors and developers o</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.775" end="00:07:22.385" style="s2"> creating alternatives to these platforms that,</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.385" end="00:07:24.875" style="s2"> they seem to be increasingly arbitrarily enacted</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.875" end="00:07:27.715" style="s2"> advantage without any hesitation,</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.715" end="00:07:30.155" style="s2"> but it is not easy. People want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.155" end="00:07:33.365" style="s2"> to say something is enough now,</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.365" end="00:07:36.205" style="s2"> and as i mentioned on the live stream the other day but</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.205" end="00:07:39.015" style="s2"> I watched my Patreon collapse, I lost an eye</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.020" end="00:07:41.260" style="s2"> 600 sponsors, about $ 5,000 a month,</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.260" end="00:07:44.420" style="s2"> but, surprisingly, that actually inspired me</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.420" end="00:07:46.645" style="s2"> because I watched ... I agree ...</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.645" end="00:07:49.565" style="s2"> Well on the one hand people send me</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.565" end="00:07:52.555" style="s2"> emails and say they give up patronage and are annoyed,</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.555" end="00:07:55.545" style="s2"> that it is not up to me and that they want to support me, on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.545" end="00:07:58.175" style="s2"> my business side tells me it&#39;s not good but</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.175" end="00:08:01.005" style="s2"> you know we&#39;ll work it out ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.005" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2"> I&#39;m the same, I&#39;ve lost a thousand subscribers and I feel the same way,</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:07.335" style="s2"> as if telling Patreon to carry on</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.335" end="00:08:10.205" style="s2"> and you know, it&#39;s not good for me financially</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.205" end="00:08:12.655" style="s2"> sides although not some big one</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.655" end="00:08:15.395" style="s2"> disaster currently, they are taking up</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.395" end="00:08:17.505" style="s2"> for the right thing and encourage us,</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.505" end="00:08:20.805" style="s2"> or let&#39;s say they encourage someone else to do something about it, so ...</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.805" end="00:08:23.845" style="s2"> I like what you said, if you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.845" end="00:08:26.975" style="s2"> we can ask you to be reasonably patient, we are talking to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.975" end="00:08:30.035" style="s2"> to all possible people and some impossible ones,</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.040" end="00:08:32.820" style="s2"> and we&#39;ll fix this, we will.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.820" end="00:08:34.780" style="s2"> Or at least we will give</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.785" end="00:08:37.425" style="s2"> do our best to fix it, there will be some obstacles along the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.425" end="00:08:39.985" style="s2"> because now we have to speed up this process</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.985" end="00:08:42.985" style="s2"> so we will consider this a beta version but</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.985" end="00:08:45.825" style="s2"> at least we hope to provide you with an easy way</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.825" end="00:08:48.825" style="s2"> to switch to a new subscription service</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.825" end="00:08:51.775" style="s2"> soon</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.780" end="00:08:54.660" style="s2"> and thank you all for your patience,</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:58.140" style="s2"> and constant support and attention</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.145" end="00:09:00.455" style="s2"> and on your opinions</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.455" end="00:09:02.695" style="s2"> and reactions to all this,</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.695" end="00:09:06.125" style="s2"> we appreciate it a lot and I would say it helps us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.255" end="00:09:07.755" style="s2"> we have motivation</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.755" end="00:09:10.655" style="s2"> to continue working.</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.715" end="00:09:13.195" style="s2"> You know, having all these subscribers on Patreon</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.195" end="00:09:15.585" style="s2"> is certainly one of the reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.585" end="00:09:18.935" style="s2"> I am trying to put this Youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.975" end="00:09:21.985" style="s2"> on, I wouldn&#39;t say first place, because he had to make room for</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.985" end="00:09:25.780" style="s2"> this tour lectures, but is very high on the list of priorities.</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.780" end="00:09:27.975" style="s2"> Sure, and it gives us a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.975" end="00:09:30.995" style="s2"> the flexibility to do various things also gave me the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.995" end="00:09:33.535" style="s2"> to join you on this tour and therefore I am</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.535" end="00:09:36.885" style="s2"> incredibly honored and grateful to everyone ...</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.885" end="00:09:39.425" style="s2"> Jordan, see you for</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.425" end="00:09:41.705" style="s2"> a few days in West Palm Beach,</p>

<p begin="00:09:57.225" end="00:09:59.655" style="s2"> then two in Australia and New Zealand,</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.655" end="00:10:02.905" style="s2"> and we will add some more, I give myself to Seoul and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.905" end="00:10:05.935" style="s2"> Singapore, maybe the Philippines,</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.940" end="00:10:08.120" style="s2"> we still have a lot of things planned ...</p>
