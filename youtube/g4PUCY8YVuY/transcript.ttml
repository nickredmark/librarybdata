<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">intertwined in this community at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:24.060" style="s2">in my mind because one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:26.580" style="s2">workshops of us planning this community</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.060" end="00:00:30.960" style="s2">is right around the time that my child</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.580" end="00:00:32.669" style="s2">was conceived and getting to watch this</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.960" end="00:00:35.579" style="s2">community come together as people joined</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.669" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">it as decisions were made as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.579" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">bureaucracy would stall it and we&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:45.660" style="s2">to figure out how to deal with internal</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">conflict and external conflict and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.660" end="00:00:51.719" style="s2">had shaped my worldview it has helped me</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:56.250" style="s2">think of ways that everybody can have</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.719" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">access to this level of community I as a</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:14.130" style="s2">means that those things have less of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">impact on my child that I get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.130" end="00:01:19.650" style="s2">amazing food for way less than if I made</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:22.500" style="s2">it by myself definitely way less energy</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.650" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">and if I made it by myself I could get</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.500" end="00:01:27.570" style="s2">connection and community when I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">capable of it when I can just like zone</p>

<p begin="00:01:44.130" end="00:01:53.070" style="s2">all of them are compassionate wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">people who I trust to discipline my kid</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.070" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">in the moment right oh maybe don&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:02.189" style="s2">that and often to do it in a better way</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.360" end="00:02:03.329" style="s2">than I can even do it especially in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.189" end="00:02:06.110" style="s2">those moments but I&#39;m not capable</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.329" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s loud and chaotic around me</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.110" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">get to eat these amazing meals get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">participate there&#39;s aspects that like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">they have a yoga room</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">that I have access to that if I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">to I could go up and do yoga in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:26.310" style="s2">private studio three times a week or</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:28.350" style="s2">more times a week there because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.310" end="00:02:29.610" style="s2">share that space right for each of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.350" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">to have their own yoga studio would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.610" end="00:02:32.250" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:34.710" style="s2">but the fact that they get to share in</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.250" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">that means that you know a middle-class</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.710" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">families have what upper-class families</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:41.640" style="s2">would have access to they all have</p>

<p begin="00:02:44.970" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">host larger extended family gatherings</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.820" end="00:02:53.880" style="s2">in and then clean up there and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:54.840" style="s2">have to bring it back to the house right</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.880" end="00:02:58.410" style="s2">not have to clean up their house the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.840" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">brand that they share in child care they</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.970" end="00:05:13.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a few this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:14.550" style="s2">conversations I was having last night</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.020" end="00:05:19.380" style="s2">when we were on a cleanup team together</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.550" end="00:05:20.910" style="s2">what is how well families work in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.380" end="00:05:22.620" style="s2">community because you can have</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.910" end="00:05:23.759" style="s2">introverts and extroverts if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.620" end="00:05:25.620" style="s2">introvert you can hang out in your house</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.759" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">most of the time and and and not go out</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.620" end="00:05:29.639" style="s2">you can go out and get social</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.940" end="00:05:33.659" style="s2">interaction when you need it or want it</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.639" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">and even when you&#39;re not like my kid can</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.659" end="00:05:36.690" style="s2">go and get social interaction in fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:40.289" style="s2">it&#39;s the one place where when we stay</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.690" end="00:05:42.300" style="s2">there my kid gets overly socialized like</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.289" end="00:05:43.860" style="s2">she gets beyond her socialization point</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.300" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">as an extrovert and needs to kinda have</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.860" end="00:05:48.630" style="s2">some down time normally in her life it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">way under that level because we exist at</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.630" end="00:05:51.870" style="s2">home the two of us and we have to let go</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:56.220" style="s2">up to the park and get that social</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.870" end="00:05:58.620" style="s2">interaction community I had so much it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.220" end="00:06:01.020" style="s2">adds actual resources for way less money</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.620" end="00:06:01.949" style="s2">everyone has a much lower social impact</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.020" end="00:06:04.409" style="s2">they&#39;re like we&#39;re going out this</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.949" end="00:06:05.880" style="s2">weekend one of the people is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.409" end="00:06:07.680" style="s2">designated driver cuz she doesn&#39;t drink</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:09.630" style="s2">but she&#39;s using one of the other women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.680" end="00:06:12.750" style="s2">cars because she has a seven-seater car</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.630" end="00:06:14.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve got brought our kids to sleepaway</p>
