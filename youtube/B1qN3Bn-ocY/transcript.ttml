<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:16.379" style="s2">you want to introduce yourself a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.070" end="00:00:18.660" style="s2">bit what what do you do and what are</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.379" end="00:00:20.880" style="s2">your interests I&#39;m a curious human being</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.660" end="00:00:23.310" style="s2">first and foremost and that has led me</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.880" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">to write a huge number of books 35 I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.310" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">think now exploring the different</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:31.019" style="s2">spiritual traditions of the world really</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:33.030" style="s2">looking for their commonality where they</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.030" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">awakening and that then led me to write</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.820" end="00:00:42.980" style="s2">what became a international bestseller</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:45.450" style="s2">so that kind of changed my journey on</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.980" end="00:00:46.980" style="s2">Gnosticism the jesus mysteries and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.450" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">choosing the lost goddess and then the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.980" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">last 20 years since then really has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:57.000" style="s2">about trying to integrate this my own</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:59.399" style="s2">experience of the world this spiritual</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">put that aside something which can give</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:13.080" style="s2">people the actual experience of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:15.000" style="s2">awakening now so it&#39;s not only an idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.080" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">it&#39;s an experience there&#39;s a few things</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">written about that are now getting a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">more attention it seems there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:26.490" style="s2">of weave the whole idea of rebel with</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">rebel wisdom is that we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.490" end="00:01:30.930" style="s2">kind of understand explain and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">contextualize what seems to be quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.930" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">big intellectual awakening that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:37.890" style="s2">on online the whole manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">long-form content long-form YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.890" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">videos has led to what a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">are kind of recognized as a real desire</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">for knowledge and a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">intellectual awakening and part of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">clearly is the sort of jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:53.430" style="s2">phenomena the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">phenomena and tied in to that it&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.430" end="00:02:02.640" style="s2">interest in christianity new interested</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">in Gnosticism and as well there is with</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.640" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">Jordan Peterson&#39;s kind of reframing of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:09.190" style="s2">the of the Christian story in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:11.740" style="s2">Psychological turn</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.190" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">and there&#39;s a real there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.740" end="00:02:16.060" style="s2">interest in the religious and the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:17.740" style="s2">again after a long time of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.060" end="00:02:20.470" style="s2">new atheist types like Richard Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.740" end="00:02:21.850" style="s2">and sam Harris of kind of they felt to</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.470" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">me like they had a bit of a stranglehold</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.850" end="00:02:27.970" style="s2">on the culture this sort of radical</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:29.820" style="s2">scientific skepticism so how does it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.970" end="00:02:34.360" style="s2">feel to you what do you make of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.820" end="00:02:36.370" style="s2">chorale I mean look I have a I had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.360" end="00:02:37.720" style="s2">of time for Richard Dawkins and people</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.370" end="00:02:39.370" style="s2">like that because I think what they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.720" end="00:02:41.470" style="s2">doing is they were still fighting the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.370" end="00:02:43.180" style="s2">Enlightenment battle which everyone what</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.470" end="00:02:45.640" style="s2">I thought they&#39;ve been one turned out it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.180" end="00:02:49.210" style="s2">haven&#39;t been one so the thing which they</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.640" end="00:02:51.430" style="s2">are attacking needs attacking however</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.210" end="00:02:54.100" style="s2">the side effect of it is you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.430" end="00:02:56.280" style="s2">said though is is this idea that it you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.100" end="00:02:58.780" style="s2">can&#39;t be intellectually credible and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.280" end="00:03:02.650" style="s2">interested in the depths of ancient</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.780" end="00:03:04.690" style="s2">wisdom or the depths of your own natures</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.650" end="00:03:06.610" style="s2">salt this is these are even to use that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.690" end="00:03:08.830" style="s2">word is immediately you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.610" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">intellectually credible so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.830" end="00:03:17.920" style="s2">really really pleased to see a renewed</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:20.530" style="s2">interest in depth and my whole hope is</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.920" end="00:03:23.860" style="s2">that we can develop I want to get it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.530" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">the place where people couldn&#39;t stand up</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.860" end="00:03:29.290" style="s2">and say things which sat which which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.720" style="s2">things like look I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.290" end="00:03:34.360" style="s2">death is not the end of this experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.720" end="00:03:36.070" style="s2">I&#39;m having a psychic I don&#39;t and I want</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.360" end="00:03:38.290" style="s2">to be able to say that and not sound</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.070" end="00:03:42.489" style="s2">like a woo idiot who&#39;s just bought into</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.290" end="00:03:44.290" style="s2">a lot of superstitious myths and at but</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.489" end="00:03:46.600" style="s2">actually has got something to say for</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.290" end="00:03:49.600" style="s2">instance and I think we can move in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.600" end="00:03:53.530" style="s2">direction I want to see a rational the</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.600" end="00:03:56.290" style="s2">science you know in general terms came</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.530" end="00:03:59.350" style="s2">in that whole movement in hit in history</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.290" end="00:04:03.730" style="s2">to question and replace irrational</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.350" end="00:04:05.290" style="s2">religion now we want the other end of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.730" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">that dialectic is to replace it with</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.290" end="00:04:11.170" style="s2">rational spirituality and if what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:13.420" style="s2">happening now with greater nuance and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.170" end="00:04:16.390" style="s2">depth and long-form discussions can lead</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.420" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">to that I think that&#39;s that&#39;s the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.390" end="00:04:21.460" style="s2">evolutionary step so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:22.420" style="s2">interesting term for kind of rational</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.460" end="00:04:25.150" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.420" end="00:04:26.530" style="s2">how does that differ to an irrational</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.150" end="00:04:28.330" style="s2">spirituality what are the key</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.530" end="00:04:30.070" style="s2">differences for you well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.330" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">I&#39;m not against a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.070" end="00:04:36.970" style="s2">irrationality I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m I I love to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.310" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">step out into what not knowing which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.970" end="00:04:40.840" style="s2">not irrational but irrational not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:42.970" style="s2">knowing for me is the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.840" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">everything so the place we have to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.970" end="00:04:50.260" style="s2">and finish is oh my god what you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:52.360" style="s2">this is we&#39;re in a breathtaking mystery</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.260" end="00:04:54.670" style="s2">that we exist and the more we find out</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.360" end="00:04:57.220" style="s2">about it the more profoundly mysterious</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.670" end="00:04:59.770" style="s2">it becomes so there&#39;s that humility is</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.220" end="00:05:02.050" style="s2">the place to start I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.770" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">being alive now for almost 60 years I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:06.670" style="s2">never met anyone who knows I&#39;m guessing</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">that nobody knows I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.670" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">it would mean to know actually what that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:16.090" style="s2">would mean so there&#39;s this enormous</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:18.820" style="s2">breathtaking mystery and then we do our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.090" end="00:05:20.530" style="s2">best to understand it and we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.820" end="00:05:23.770" style="s2">open to everything and diet is our</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.530" end="00:05:25.690" style="s2">greatest ally on that so that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.770" end="00:05:27.550" style="s2">wrong with irrational spirituality is it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.690" end="00:05:29.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the doubt it doesn&#39;t move</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.550" end="00:05:30.760" style="s2">on it&#39;s based on a reverence for old</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.410" end="00:05:31.930" style="s2">ideas which should become established</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.760" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">written in old books</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.930" end="00:05:35.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t question itself and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:37.390" style="s2">it&#39;s stuck and there and people who</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.320" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">believe it if they don&#39;t question them</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.390" end="00:05:41.740" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it unconsciously which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:44.020" style="s2">why most people are doing it with</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.740" end="00:05:46.060" style="s2">something to happen to be born in what</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.020" end="00:05:47.620" style="s2">rationality does is from impression</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.060" end="00:05:50.680" style="s2">ality all it means is having a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.620" end="00:05:52.360" style="s2">reason so if you think it&#39;s in the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.680" end="00:05:54.670" style="s2">is a good reason then that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.360" end="00:05:56.980" style="s2">reason I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.670" end="00:05:59.500" style="s2">reason but what&#39;s really interesting as</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.980" end="00:06:01.390" style="s2">well as the idea so the Bible the books</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.500" end="00:06:04.300" style="s2">in the Bible were assembled over many</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.390" end="00:06:04.930" style="s2">centuries millennia and it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.300" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">great idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.930" end="00:06:09.610" style="s2">so take the best wisdom that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">and make that into a way of living your</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.610" end="00:06:14.740" style="s2">life but at some point someone says okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:16.480" style="s2">right we&#39;re done this is it the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.740" end="00:06:17.980" style="s2">finished no one&#39;s ever going to come up</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.480" end="00:06:21.490" style="s2">with any other new ideas that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.980" end="00:06:23.350" style="s2">in this book and that that for me sounds</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.490" end="00:06:24.820" style="s2">peculiar but when you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.350" end="00:06:26.260" style="s2">Bible&#39;s accreted over many years it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.820" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">sounds like well that would there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.260" end="00:06:29.230" style="s2">lot of there&#39;s got to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:31.300" style="s2">accumulated wisdom in there but at what</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.230" end="00:06:32.590" style="s2">point do you say right nothing more we</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.300" end="00:06:34.470" style="s2">need to know we just need to live by</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.590" end="00:06:36.270" style="s2">these rules exactly and and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.470" end="00:06:39.210" style="s2">I mean you know obviously you you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.270" end="00:06:41.460" style="s2">aware of the beautifully circular kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.210" end="00:06:43.110" style="s2">of literalist view of the Bible where</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.460" end="00:06:44.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like I know it&#39;s true because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.110" end="00:06:46.650" style="s2">in the Bible how do you know it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.760" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">because the Bible says the Bible is true</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.650" end="00:06:50.790" style="s2">and you&#39;ve just going boom boom boom</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:54.890" style="s2">round in a circle so and that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.790" end="00:06:58.110" style="s2">a historical you the whole collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.890" end="00:07:00.480" style="s2">the literalist view of Christianity came</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.110" end="00:07:02.820" style="s2">through Protestant Reformation leading</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.480" end="00:07:05.070" style="s2">to the study of the Bible which no one</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.820" end="00:07:06.900" style="s2">had done and then you have an historical</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.070" end="00:07:11.010" style="s2">appreciation of it and then it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.900" end="00:07:13.290" style="s2">longer the revealed Word of God and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.010" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">it&#39;s up for question and then you start</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.290" end="00:07:16.890" style="s2">learning the history of it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:19.950" style="s2">great history and the people that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.890" end="00:07:23.490" style="s2">been involved in it are not the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.950" end="00:07:25.590" style="s2">people that you want to trust I talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.490" end="00:07:27.060" style="s2">before about this kind of intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.590" end="00:07:28.800" style="s2">awakening that a lot of people are kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.060" end="00:07:30.120" style="s2">of recognizing is this something that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.800" end="00:07:31.710" style="s2">you&#39;ve encountered do you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.120" end="00:07:35.130" style="s2">you&#39;ve been stimulated by stuff you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.710" end="00:07:37.350" style="s2">been seeing online recently well I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.130" end="00:07:39.419" style="s2">stimulated by the documentary you made</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.350" end="00:07:41.490" style="s2">with Jordan Peterson I mean that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.419" end="00:07:44.490" style="s2">been the most obvious example for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.490" end="00:07:47.310" style="s2">where there&#39;s been this phenomena happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.490" end="00:07:49.560" style="s2">and my entry point from was somebody</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.310" end="00:07:51.120" style="s2">sending me videos but the first one was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.560" end="00:07:55.860" style="s2">the one you made which I thought was</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.120" end="00:07:57.660" style="s2">excellent and I saw that this was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.860" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">questioning seeing again seeing Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.660" end="00:08:01.979" style="s2">on the news was astonishing for me half</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:04.530" style="s2">an hour with an intellectual being</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.979" end="00:08:05.970" style="s2">questioned was wow this doesn&#39;t happen I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.530" end="00:08:09.990" style="s2">mean I can&#39;t think of a phenomena like</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.970" end="00:08:11.820" style="s2">it may be Bertrand Russell in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.990" end="00:08:16.770" style="s2">lifetime I mean just about in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.820" end="00:08:18.570" style="s2">lifetime but not since it and so Sam</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.770" end="00:08:23.310" style="s2">Harris of course and all that so there</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.570" end="00:08:25.830" style="s2">is a definite I like most people when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.310" end="00:08:27.360" style="s2">came to communicate my ideas for people</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.830" end="00:08:29.330" style="s2">in the know are telling me all you need</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.360" end="00:08:33.089" style="s2">to make it short snappy sound by it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.330" end="00:08:34.710" style="s2">simple and I&#39;m quite out for simple as</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.089" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">long as it&#39;s not too simple it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.710" end="00:08:39.180" style="s2">simplistic it&#39;s like carbines die sets</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2">very famously or even as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:45.930" style="s2">possible but no simpler and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:47.210" style="s2">good mantra but actually turns out</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.930" end="00:08:50.029" style="s2">people who want</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.210" end="00:08:55.880" style="s2">want depth so that I&#39;m finding people</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.029" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">are responding to a real conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.880" end="00:08:59.870" style="s2">which is what I&#39;ve loved always that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.190" style="s2">why I spent my life doing so that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.870" end="00:09:02.810" style="s2">suddenly there&#39;s a chance to have real</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.190" end="00:09:04.370" style="s2">conversation with people like yourself</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.810" end="00:09:06.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.370" end="00:09:08.750" style="s2">going oh yes please I think that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.770" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">really significant I mean how wide that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.750" end="00:09:17.240" style="s2">spreads we&#39;ll see but that the John</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:19.220" style="s2">Peterson effect has been so out of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.240" end="00:09:20.870" style="s2">blue really I I&#39;m gonna admire you for</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.220" end="00:09:22.279" style="s2">seeing it coming because I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.870" end="00:09:25.160" style="s2">don&#39;t see it coming yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.279" end="00:09:26.510" style="s2">interesting we were sort of very we want</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.160" end="00:09:29.300" style="s2">to make sure that our channel is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.510" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">just kind of Jordan Peterson only but</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.300" end="00:09:33.830" style="s2">it&#39;s such a useful window and lens to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:35.779" style="s2">start looking at what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.830" end="00:09:37.100" style="s2">culture and obviously the expansion into</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.779" end="00:09:39.740" style="s2">the intellectual dark web and other</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.100" end="00:09:43.250" style="s2">people riding the same wave that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.740" end="00:09:45.020" style="s2">Peterson talks about and I know that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.250" end="00:09:47.480" style="s2">you&#39;ve written quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.020" end="00:09:48.770" style="s2">agnosticism in the past one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.480" end="00:09:50.390" style="s2">things that got us quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.770" end="00:09:53.150" style="s2">pushback was in that first child release</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.390" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">and documentary we mentioned Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.150" end="00:09:59.180" style="s2">and a lot of people didn&#39;t like that do</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:01.250" style="s2">you what can you explain what Gnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.180" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">is firstly and why it&#39;s always been like</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.250" end="00:10:06.830" style="s2">this controversial thing within</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:09.830" style="s2">Christianity so Gnosticism is a general</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.830" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">term for a whole wide range of sex in</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.830" end="00:10:14.029" style="s2">the ancient world who were very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:15.950" style="s2">different actually what linked them</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.029" end="00:10:17.600" style="s2">together was that their idea of</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.950" end="00:10:19.490" style="s2">Christianity was based around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.600" end="00:10:22.790" style="s2">experience of new gnosis which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.490" end="00:10:25.700" style="s2">knowing deep mystical knowing knowing of</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.790" end="00:10:28.339" style="s2">oneself and knowing of God which turns</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.700" end="00:10:30.920" style="s2">out to be the same thing so that so</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.339" end="00:10:32.930" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re about knowledge whereas</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.920" end="00:10:34.160" style="s2">traditional literalist Roman</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.930" end="00:10:35.779" style="s2">Christianity which is what we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.160" end="00:10:39.709" style="s2">talking about the the religion of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.779" end="00:10:43.370" style="s2">Roman Empire is about belief pissed as&#39;</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.709" end="00:10:47.240" style="s2">notice and pestis so they are they are</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.370" end="00:10:50.660" style="s2">rivals in the first centuries for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.240" end="00:10:52.100" style="s2">soul of Christianity the version taught</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.660" end="00:10:54.050" style="s2">by the Roman Empire which has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.100" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">embraced pretty much unquestioned until</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.050" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">recently is that the Gnostics were</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:01.730" style="s2">heretics who kind of went pagan and got</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">confused and are therefore dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.730" end="00:11:07.370" style="s2">will lead you astray the truth in my own</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:09.590" style="s2">opinion from my own studies is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.370" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">opposite that the Gnostics are the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.590" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">original Christians who were then</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">literalized into a cult which became</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:18.470" style="s2">part of the Roman Empire and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.930" style="s2">destroyed everything the pagan world the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.470" end="00:11:23.530" style="s2">Jewish world indeed as well and ancient</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.930" end="00:11:26.450" style="s2">Gnosticism and there&#39;s always been this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.530" end="00:11:29.120" style="s2">battle in between this established</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.450" end="00:11:32.450" style="s2">religion of an empire and this rebel</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.120" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">undercurrent which is about not priests</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.450" end="00:11:36.260" style="s2">and bishops but you knowing for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:40.100" style="s2">through a direct experience of gnosis</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.260" end="00:11:42.190" style="s2">and we we both worked on this particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.100" end="00:11:46.070" style="s2">line in the documentary but we kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.190" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">suggested that he he had a gnostic the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.070" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">jordan Peterson had a more Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:51.950" style="s2">understanding Christianity and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:53.270" style="s2">people really push back on that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.950" end="00:11:55.100" style="s2">really didn&#39;t like yeah I mean why why</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.270" end="00:11:57.320" style="s2">Jordan has got a more Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.100" end="00:11:59.330" style="s2">appreciation of it from what I</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.320" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">understand of him is that he&#39;s a myth</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.330" end="00:12:06.170" style="s2">mythologies that the thing which marks</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:08.180" style="s2">out the Gnostic Christians is that they</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.170" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">are looking at the Jesus story and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.180" end="00:12:12.950" style="s2">indeed the other stories but the Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:15.950" style="s2">story as an as a spiritual allegory</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.950" end="00:12:17.660" style="s2">which leads to gnosis it&#39;s not about a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.950" end="00:12:20.930" style="s2">belief in an actual historical event</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.660" end="00:12:23.780" style="s2">about a real man it&#39;s that rather he is</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.930" end="00:12:27.830" style="s2">an everyman character as young of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.780" end="00:12:29.660" style="s2">himself was a gnostic and wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.830" end="00:12:31.550" style="s2">seven servants of the dead in the name</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.660" end="00:12:33.410" style="s2">of a gnostic teacher bazzill a des and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.550" end="00:12:37.550" style="s2">bought the gnostic manuscripts once so</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.410" end="00:12:40.070" style="s2">which is why we have them is the that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.550" end="00:12:41.810" style="s2">Jesus is an archetype of the self so</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.070" end="00:12:43.550" style="s2">that they were seeing the Jesus story</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.810" end="00:12:46.670" style="s2">right from the birth and the cave to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.550" end="00:12:48.050" style="s2">empty cave at the end as an allegory</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.670" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">about one&#39;s own spiritual journey</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.050" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">through stages of initiation to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.990" end="00:12:56.210" style="s2">awakening that&#39;s not what I was told at</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">Sunday School and because of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.210" end="00:13:00.740" style="s2">mismatch that&#39;s why people are very wary</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.970" end="00:13:02.150" style="s2">of the Gnostics and something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.740" end="00:13:05.030" style="s2">always found fascinating it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.150" end="00:13:07.760" style="s2">confusing talking to two Christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.030" end="00:13:10.180" style="s2">friends is that they often say that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.760" end="00:13:12.910" style="s2">is the literal physical resurrect</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.180" end="00:13:14.920" style="s2">of Jesus that is at the core of at least</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.910" end="00:13:16.540" style="s2">that form of literalist Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.920" end="00:13:20.830" style="s2">without him the whole thing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.540" end="00:13:24.850" style="s2">falls apart why is that yeah why is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.830" end="00:13:26.529" style="s2">it&#39;s big there you know the strange</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.850" end="00:13:28.300" style="s2">thing is you know that only makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.529" end="00:13:29.800" style="s2">if you have a literal atom and even than</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.300" end="00:13:32.470" style="s2">a literal fall because the whole</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.800" end="00:13:35.709" style="s2">mythology is that it&#39;s a it&#39;s redemption</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.470" end="00:13:37.029" style="s2">for that fall so if you really go down</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.709" end="00:13:38.260" style="s2">the literalist road and you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.029" end="00:13:40.089" style="s2">to believe that everything was created</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.260" end="00:13:41.320" style="s2">in seven days and Adam and Eve and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.089" end="00:13:43.450" style="s2">the rest of it then you do need a</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.320" end="00:13:45.700" style="s2">literal Jesus but if you understand that</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.450" end="00:13:48.339" style="s2">as mythology then you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.700" end="00:13:50.380" style="s2">Jesus as mythology it&#39;s just a big jump</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.339" end="00:13:51.970" style="s2">people feel they&#39;re losing something you</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.380" end="00:13:53.470" style="s2">know if when they read my you know or</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.970" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">come across my ideas and it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.470" end="00:13:58.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t you think that Jesus is a myth</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:14:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh the the truth however is</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.660" end="00:14:05.800" style="s2">the opposite what strikes me is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.640" end="00:14:07.570" style="s2">everyone has their own Jesus you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.800" end="00:14:09.399" style="s2">you speak to a fundamentalist and Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.570" end="00:14:11.110" style="s2">is a you know fire and brimstone you</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.399" end="00:14:13.300" style="s2">talk to a nice Quaker and Jesus is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:14.950" style="s2">passive this you talk to Muslim and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.300" end="00:14:16.690" style="s2">Jesus is a prophet like Muhammad but</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.950" end="00:14:18.700" style="s2">just not quite as good and the you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.690" end="00:14:22.120" style="s2">or eise you know everyone&#39;s got their</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.700" end="00:14:25.570" style="s2">own Jesus and he&#39;s just like them now if</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.120" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">there was an historical Jesus most</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.570" end="00:14:29.800" style="s2">people must accept that their Jesus is</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:31.240" style="s2">not the real one and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.800" end="00:14:34.750" style="s2">they&#39;re having a relationship with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.240" end="00:14:36.910" style="s2">fantasy which is Trembley sad on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.750" end="00:14:38.500" style="s2">other hand if you understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.910" end="00:14:40.510" style="s2">figure is designed to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.500" end="00:14:42.520" style="s2">representation for your own deeper self</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.510" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly right you should have your</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.520" end="00:14:47.830" style="s2">own Jesus I have my own Jesus Jesus is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:50.709" style="s2">in my life it&#39;s just not it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.830" end="00:14:54.130" style="s2">literal man it&#39;s a it&#39;s a mask of God</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.709" end="00:14:55.930" style="s2">like Joseph Campbell said so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.130" end="00:14:57.700" style="s2">something which you reach through just</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.930" end="00:14:59.800" style="s2">in the same way that you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.700" end="00:15:01.270" style="s2">think most people certainly the West</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.800" end="00:15:03.610" style="s2">would see there was a literal Krishna or</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:04.990" style="s2">additional Vishnu or a middle drama that</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.610" end="00:15:07.720" style="s2">in the same way or indeed the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.990" end="00:15:10.899" style="s2">gods the Dionysus or Cyrus so do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.720" end="00:15:13.630" style="s2">think Jesus really existed no no I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.899" end="00:15:15.459" style="s2">the evidence personally really really</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.630" end="00:15:16.899" style="s2">points us three there&#39;s three prongs to</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.459" end="00:15:19.810" style="s2">that really I mean I certainly didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.899" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">set out with that I mean I when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.810" end="00:15:25.019" style="s2">started work on the Gnostics I</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.720" end="00:15:27.300" style="s2">I assumed there was a real Jesus that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.019" end="00:15:29.189" style="s2">almost became a friar when I was younger</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.300" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">you know brought up in the Church of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.189" end="00:15:34.589" style="s2">England and very nearly joined the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">church but eventually with the research</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.589" end="00:15:43.110" style="s2">there seem to be three things one was</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:46.439" style="s2">the incredible similarities between</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.110" end="00:15:48.839" style="s2">ancient pagan mythology and what became</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.439" end="00:15:50.759" style="s2">with Jesus story and seeing that in that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.839" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">in these ancient pagan myths of a son of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.759" end="00:15:54.779" style="s2">god or a god man were all the motifs now</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:56.040" style="s2">people attack that because there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.779" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no ancient story which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:00.060" style="s2">same it&#39;s not like a it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:02.399" style="s2">copied but it&#39;s more like you would get</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.060" end="00:16:04.019" style="s2">in film today or in you know if you took</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.399" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the matrix you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.019" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">probably go look he&#39;s taken that from</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:08.220" style="s2">there and that&#39;s come from there and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:10.199" style="s2">that&#39;s and from it&#39;s created a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.220" end="00:16:13.350" style="s2">thing that&#39;s of the Jesus time it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.199" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">taken all these motifs so that just</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.350" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">about every single thing probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:20.310" style="s2">everything actually that makes up the</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:22.529" style="s2">Jesus story as a narrative is already</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.310" end="00:16:24.779" style="s2">there in the ancient world and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.529" end="00:16:26.339" style="s2">there&#39;s that so it resembles pagan myths</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.779" end="00:16:29.220" style="s2">there&#39;s the fact that the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.339" end="00:16:31.980" style="s2">Christians don&#39;t deny this there you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.220" end="00:16:34.709" style="s2">get Justin Martyr who actually it makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.980" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">a virtue of it that the similarities so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.709" end="00:16:38.279" style="s2">they&#39;re not the why it&#39;s a shock today</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.480" end="00:16:40.170" style="s2">when people realize it&#39;s the same as</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.279" end="00:16:42.809" style="s2">pagan mythology it wasn&#39;t then it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.170" end="00:16:43.829" style="s2">obviously so that&#39;s the one kind of part</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.809" end="00:16:46.920" style="s2">of it and then there the others are</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.829" end="00:16:51.269" style="s2">Gnostics which is here is a group of</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.920" end="00:16:54.329" style="s2">people who are predate actually the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.269" end="00:16:55.790" style="s2">of year 0 because there is no USERRA so</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.329" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">they&#39;ve been around and they&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.790" end="00:17:02.339" style="s2">the myths of the the earth mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">and that as an allegory Exodus in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.339" end="00:17:06.539" style="s2">particular they&#39;re around Alexandria</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:08.039" style="s2">where I think all of this is being</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.539" end="00:17:10.260" style="s2">written which is like the New York of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.039" end="00:17:12.750" style="s2">the ancient world big Jewish community</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:15.020" style="s2">all speaking Greek which is the English</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.750" end="00:17:17.549" style="s2">of the ancient world and they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.020" end="00:17:19.230" style="s2">writing all these documents in in Greek</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.549" end="00:17:21.240" style="s2">and we have loads of them which accord</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.230" end="00:17:23.069" style="s2">into testamental texts and they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.240" end="00:17:25.079" style="s2">combination of Jewish mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.069" end="00:17:27.419" style="s2">pagan mythology and then at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.079" end="00:17:30.059" style="s2">them becomes this other these other</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.419" end="00:17:32.250" style="s2">texts these Gnostic texts which I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.059" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">are there all Gnostic which have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.250" end="00:17:36.140" style="s2">amazing story of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:37.790" style="s2">ridhima which are very similar to pagan</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.140" end="00:17:39.590" style="s2">myths and they themselves are a mixture</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.790" end="00:17:42.230" style="s2">of pagan and Jewish mythology and it</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.590" end="00:17:45.049" style="s2">just feels us a natural continuation and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.230" end="00:17:46.700" style="s2">they see it as their great heresy for</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.049" end="00:17:50.150" style="s2">which they were put down is Jesus never</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.700" end="00:17:51.590" style="s2">came in the flesh he comes in you so</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.150" end="00:17:53.809" style="s2">that&#39;s the two and then the third thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.590" end="00:17:57.470" style="s2">is there is no evidence for historical</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.809" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">man none nothing absolutely nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.470" end="00:18:00.980" style="s2">the only things which are held up but</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:04.640" style="s2">this little passage in the Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.980" end="00:18:06.440" style="s2">historian Josephus is I mean any any</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.640" end="00:18:08.600" style="s2">scholar with this all know the fake is</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.440" end="00:18:11.299" style="s2">that the language is wrong it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.600" end="00:18:12.770" style="s2">added later it&#39;s and it shows just how</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.299" end="00:18:14.780" style="s2">they were desperate to find some</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.770" end="00:18:17.450" style="s2">something which they could hang this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.780" end="00:18:19.549" style="s2">room so it&#39;s not important to me really</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.450" end="00:18:21.470" style="s2">whether there was or wasn&#39;t a historical</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.549" end="00:18:23.630" style="s2">Jesus then more and more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.470" end="00:18:26.570" style="s2">what the myth means but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.630" end="00:18:28.700" style="s2">there was there was another part of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.570" end="00:18:30.919" style="s2">myth my understanding which integrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.700" end="00:18:33.830" style="s2">Sofia so kind of Divine Feminine</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.919" end="00:18:36.950" style="s2">archetype which seems very missing from</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.830" end="00:18:39.950" style="s2">Christianity otherwise so what was</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.950" end="00:18:41.179" style="s2">Sophia to the Gnostics yeah isn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.950" end="00:18:42.890" style="s2">mean isn&#39;t that amazing there was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.179" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">Christian goddess I mean isn&#39;t that I</p>

<p begin="00:19:23.419" end="00:19:30.260" style="s2">of potentiality for everything and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:31.400" style="s2">goddess is all form that the probably</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.260" end="00:19:33.590" style="s2">the easiest understanding of that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.400" end="00:19:35.540" style="s2">knew it in the Egyptian tradition the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.590" end="00:19:37.309" style="s2">night sky she&#39;s the whole universe and</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.900" end="00:20:02.380" style="s2">is that potentiality that pure being</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.869" end="00:22:34.849" style="s2">center and so she&#39;s the dis she still by</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.869" end="00:22:37.179" style="s2">the Catholic Church is still called the</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.179" end="00:22:40.699" style="s2">so quite important and really</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.709" end="00:22:42.649" style="s2">interesting if you go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.699" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">Gnostic literature one of the great</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.649" end="00:22:45.409" style="s2">things they&#39;re condemned for which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:47.179" style="s2">really interesting is that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.409" end="00:22:50.749" style="s2">pythagorean&#39;s release so they treat</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.179" end="00:22:52.419" style="s2">women really well and and of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.749" end="00:22:56.329" style="s2">guy called Celsus who writes about</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.419" end="00:22:58.729" style="s2">attacking the Gnostics and every gospel</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.329" end="00:23:01.339" style="s2">he mentions just about is accredited to</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.729" end="00:23:03.469" style="s2">a woman and they&#39;re great you know they</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.339" end="00:23:04.969" style="s2">have women priests and the church is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.469" end="00:23:06.979" style="s2">very upset about the whole thing but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.969" end="00:23:08.239" style="s2">kind of interesting today from our point</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.979" end="00:23:10.879" style="s2">of view to look back and go oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.239" end="00:23:14.449" style="s2">much more like us why do you think this</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.879" end="00:23:18.019" style="s2">is relevant or why do you think that why</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.449" end="00:23:19.699" style="s2">is this important now I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.019" end="00:23:21.379" style="s2">they&#39;re going back with Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.699" end="00:23:24.289" style="s2">which is you know my early work 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.379" end="00:23:25.969" style="s2">ago is a bit like psych therapy it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.289" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">bit like our culturally we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.969" end="00:23:30.319" style="s2">back there&#39;s a there&#39;s a schism in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.719" style="s2">Western soul between our pagan roots and</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.319" end="00:23:35.059" style="s2">our Christian roots and we&#39;ve been told</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.719" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">that they&#39;re their enemies and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.059" end="00:23:40.009" style="s2">not they&#39;re exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:42.289" style="s2">Christianity is paganism there&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.009" end="00:23:44.409" style="s2">one evolutionary current in the West of</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.289" end="00:23:47.389" style="s2">course how could there be otherwise and</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.409" end="00:23:49.039" style="s2">that and I think there&#39;s a great healing</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.389" end="00:23:51.229" style="s2">that can happen with that and I also</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.039" end="00:23:52.729" style="s2">think the return to the Gnostic spirit</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.229" end="00:23:58.190" style="s2">which has been so prevalent since the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.729" end="00:24:00.769" style="s2">sixties there&#39;s a return to self that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.190" end="00:24:02.779" style="s2">the individual journey of the syph self</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.769" end="00:24:05.119" style="s2">inquiry and do you think that&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.779" end="00:24:07.159" style="s2">more popular because of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.119" end="00:24:09.349" style="s2">spiritual technologies we have that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.159" end="00:24:10.700" style="s2">psychedelics in the internal experience</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.349" end="00:24:11.250" style="s2">of the divine that a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.700" end="00:24:16.169" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.250" end="00:24:17.610" style="s2">have led to a revival of Gnosticism wow</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.169" end="00:24:20.929" style="s2">that&#39;s really it I mean certainly</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.610" end="00:24:23.789" style="s2">psychedelics I think did play a big role</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.929" end="00:24:25.350" style="s2">so many different currents also you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.789" end="00:24:27.179" style="s2">we brought in a lot of the eastern</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.350" end="00:24:29.940" style="s2">wisdom which had kept those currents</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.179" end="00:24:31.830" style="s2">alive because they hadn&#39;t gone through</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.940" end="00:24:35.580" style="s2">the same level of individuation that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.830" end="00:24:38.520" style="s2">did they missed that but and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.580" end="00:24:40.020" style="s2">suffered for it but they benefit by</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.520" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">keeping that other current alive so it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.020" end="00:24:43.679" style="s2">looked very attractive to us so we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:46.169" style="s2">go across to to a Asia and just go oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.679" end="00:24:48.510" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the inner mystery still and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.169" end="00:24:50.669" style="s2">then then that&#39;s what I did most of my</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.510" end="00:24:52.409" style="s2">early books are on Eastern spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.669" end="00:24:54.330" style="s2">and then looking at the Gnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.409" end="00:24:56.220" style="s2">dynamic goddess it&#39;s right here in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.330" end="00:24:58.860" style="s2">Western tradition and it heals that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.220" end="00:25:00.030" style="s2">divide so for me it&#39;s I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.860" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">interested in where how we take it</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.030" end="00:25:03.510" style="s2">forward but I think there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:05.970" style="s2">very healing about it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.510" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">something which enables us to choose a</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.310" end="00:28:05.040" style="s2">so much so that you see this break where</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.790" end="00:28:08.780" style="s2">that starts to happen with the triumph</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.040" end="00:28:12.600" style="s2">of Christianity and this monotheistic</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.600" end="00:28:19.380" style="s2">then the ancient soul comes back with</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.070" end="00:28:21.670" style="s2">the Renaissance and you get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.380" end="00:28:26.920" style="s2">discovery of the the ancient texts</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.670" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">Atika the the platonic texts and you see</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.920" end="00:28:31.240" style="s2">the birth of this incredible awakening</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:33.400" style="s2">very much like now I think this the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.240" end="00:28:36.790" style="s2">extraordinary awakening in the arts and</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.400" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">in the intelligence and in its in</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.790" end="00:28:42.100" style="s2">scholarly studies in the past and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:47.470" style="s2">starts what&#39;s going to become science so</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.100" end="00:28:49.030" style="s2">that current coming back in now we we</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.470" end="00:28:51.760" style="s2">can see how it that has all happened</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.030" end="00:28:53.350" style="s2">then it feels like we can integrate we</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.760" end="00:28:55.150" style="s2">it&#39;s going to help us integrate our past</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.350" end="00:28:57.280" style="s2">and the whole point for doing that is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.150" end="00:28:59.920" style="s2">go forward is to feel that we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.280" end="00:29:03.130" style="s2">to get now stuck in this rather fallen</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.920" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">limited reductionist science where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.130" end="00:29:07.390" style="s2">ended up which is phenomenal on the one</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:07.870" style="s2">hand I mean I&#39;ve so much respect for its</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.390" end="00:29:09.610" style="s2">achievements</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.870" end="00:29:12.010" style="s2">it&#39;s unbelievable what it&#39;s done and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.610" end="00:29:14.500" style="s2">it&#39;s philosophically pretty impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.010" end="00:29:16.300" style="s2">and is literally soul destroying</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.500" end="00:29:17.620" style="s2">literally has taken this experience</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.300" end="00:29:20.530" style="s2">we&#39;re having right now have the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.620" end="00:29:23.050" style="s2">the soul and gone it&#39;s a kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.530" end="00:29:25.570" style="s2">illusion created buying a piece of meat</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.050" end="00:29:29.100" style="s2">and of no significance whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.570" end="00:29:32.500" style="s2">really and that reductionism is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.100" end="00:29:33.550" style="s2">damaging to the heart to the soul so if</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.500" end="00:29:35.950" style="s2">we can integrate all of that together</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.550" end="00:29:37.420" style="s2">there maybe we can step forward into</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.950" end="00:29:39.820" style="s2">something which goes look there&#39;s value</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.420" end="00:29:41.740" style="s2">in all of that there&#39;s a there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.820" end="00:29:45.280" style="s2">be another beautiful cycle there of when</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.740" end="00:29:47.080" style="s2">things become unmovable in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.280" end="00:29:48.280" style="s2">we look into the ancient past and a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.080" end="00:29:48.910" style="s2">people who&#39;ve spoken to you have said</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.280" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.910" end="00:29:53.710" style="s2">so what do you think is the weight or</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:54.850" style="s2">what&#39;s your particular way of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.710" end="00:29:55.390" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot in the past and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.850" end="00:29:57.850" style="s2">suppose</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.390" end="00:30:00.040" style="s2">selecting what&#39;s needed for right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.850" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">selecting the right wisdom it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.040" end="00:30:04.840" style="s2">important so what are some of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:06.850" style="s2">you think we can start using ancient</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.840" end="00:30:09.550" style="s2">wisdom to start moving forward in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.850" end="00:30:11.860" style="s2">society you know what I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.550" end="00:30:14.680" style="s2">embedded in it for so long so many</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.860" end="00:30:17.770" style="s2">decades it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s just in me now</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.680" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">and so in my actual response to your</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.770" end="00:30:23.320" style="s2">question is the danger I think now is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:25.660" style="s2">the opposite I what I see as</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.320" end="00:30:29.740" style="s2">romanticization of the past and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.660" end="00:30:32.350" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of a way of oh we had it</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.740" end="00:30:33.790" style="s2">then and we lost it or the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.350" end="00:30:34.070" style="s2">are still living in the jungles they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.790" end="00:30:35.420" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.070" end="00:30:37.190" style="s2">we haven&#39;t got and it just feels like</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.420" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">look there is something which we lose</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.190" end="00:30:41.230" style="s2">you always lose something when you gain</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:42.800" style="s2">something and there&#39;s something which</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.230" end="00:30:44.960" style="s2">cultures that live in very different</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.800" end="00:30:45.910" style="s2">ways have that we don&#39;t have that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.960" end="00:30:48.620" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.910" end="00:30:51.080" style="s2">but I&#39;m really really careful of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.620" end="00:30:52.970" style="s2">romanticization of it as if somehow we</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.080" end="00:30:54.440" style="s2">need to get back to something I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.970" end="00:30:56.390" style="s2">think we do I think we need to keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.440" end="00:30:59.390" style="s2">going with the evolutionary current just</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.390" end="00:31:02.980" style="s2">just we&#39;re doing we&#39;re doing fine you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.390" end="00:31:07.160" style="s2">know it&#39;s raising place quite</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.980" end="00:31:09.080" style="s2">astonishing where we are and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.160" end="00:31:12.260" style="s2">better shape than we&#39;ve ever been and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.080" end="00:31:14.150" style="s2">just need to keep going and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.260" end="00:31:17.030" style="s2">the thing which is which is missing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.150" end="00:31:18.620" style="s2">right now what is missing is well the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.030" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">reductionist thing is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.620" end="00:31:22.520" style="s2">because that takes everything and pulls</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:25.040" style="s2">it down to the book the most basic level</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.520" end="00:31:28.970" style="s2">and what excites me and my latest work</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.040" end="00:31:31.190" style="s2">is this emergentist view that&#39;s arriving</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.970" end="00:31:32.540" style="s2">with an evolutionary understanding which</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.190" end="00:31:35.210" style="s2">says the opposite to reduction which</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:37.670" style="s2">goes no don&#39;t reduce everything to its</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.210" end="00:31:39.980" style="s2">components actually see that greater and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.670" end="00:31:41.930" style="s2">greater wholes are emerging greater than</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.980" end="00:31:44.540" style="s2">there&#39;s creativity to the whole process</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.930" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">of the the universe so you&#39;ve got that</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.540" end="00:31:49.160" style="s2">literally in the construction of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:51.320" style="s2">physical universe and the biological</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.160" end="00:31:52.910" style="s2">universe and I think also the universe</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.320" end="00:31:54.020" style="s2">of the soul which is what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.910" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">about when we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.020" end="00:32:00.560" style="s2">history of Western ideas so I find that</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:03.020" style="s2">really interesting this idea of a model</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.560" end="00:32:04.760" style="s2">of reality that is somehow inherently</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.020" end="00:32:07.280" style="s2">evolutionary and it&#39;s always going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.760" end="00:32:08.840" style="s2">some kind of greater whole could you</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.280" end="00:32:11.660" style="s2">talk a little bit more about that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.840" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">what that means to you yeah I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.660" end="00:32:16.490" style="s2">delighted to this is my real passion my</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.360" end="00:32:18.770" style="s2">latest work which I think is my best in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.490" end="00:32:21.260" style="s2">a book called soul story it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.770" end="00:32:26.330" style="s2">trying to lay out an emergentist</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.260" end="00:32:29.060" style="s2">spiritual philosophy and the basic the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.330" end="00:32:30.470" style="s2">basic thesis comes from my technique is</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.060" end="00:32:33.290" style="s2">a philosopher&#39;s to look at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:35.870" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so what was</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.290" end="00:32:38.870" style="s2">this what&#39;s this what&#39;s this so what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.870" end="00:32:41.960" style="s2">see when I look at the moment is a flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.870" end="00:32:45.170" style="s2">of experiences so what seems to be real</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.960" end="00:32:46.130" style="s2">is time despite the people that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.170" end="00:32:47.570" style="s2">constantly tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.130" end="00:32:49.010" style="s2">that it&#39;s an illusion I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.570" end="00:32:52.490" style="s2">know what that means because what I see</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.010" end="00:32:53.780" style="s2">is every moment is this flow of time so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.490" end="00:32:55.880" style="s2">I started looking at the flow of time</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.780" end="00:32:58.310" style="s2">and it felt like ah it with what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.880" end="00:33:00.740" style="s2">qualities that it has in it is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.310" end="00:33:04.010" style="s2">every moment is a is realizing a new</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:05.630" style="s2">potentiality like this one isn&#39;t and a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.010" end="00:33:06.920" style="s2">new and no two moments were ever the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.630" end="00:33:10.070" style="s2">same these are obvious things but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.920" end="00:33:12.350" style="s2">fascinated by the obvious and that every</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.070" end="00:33:14.330" style="s2">moment also contains within it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.350" end="00:33:16.940" style="s2">implicitly everything that&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.330" end="00:33:20.870" style="s2">before so it feels like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.940" end="00:33:24.410" style="s2">interesting so so that we have this idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.870" end="00:33:26.950" style="s2">in English that the past passes but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.410" end="00:33:31.100" style="s2">hasn&#39;t passed it&#39;s actually right here</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.950" end="00:33:33.980" style="s2">it&#39;s the time actually doesn&#39;t pass the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.100" end="00:33:36.910" style="s2">past accumulates there&#39;s just more past</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.980" end="00:33:39.260" style="s2">and more past and more past and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.910" end="00:33:41.330" style="s2">present implicitly in the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.260" end="00:33:43.070" style="s2">that each moment has this quality of</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.330" end="00:33:45.470" style="s2">being a new realizing a new possibility</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.070" end="00:33:47.930" style="s2">and containing everything that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.470" end="00:33:50.780" style="s2">before so that the moment is made of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.930" end="00:33:53.330" style="s2">past coexisting with the possible and</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.780" end="00:33:56.600" style="s2">that feels to me a description of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.330" end="00:33:58.220" style="s2">fundamental nature of what reality is so</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.600" end="00:34:01.070" style="s2">that what we&#39;re seeing 13.8 billion</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.220" end="00:34:04.490" style="s2">years ago if the dates are right is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.070" end="00:34:07.670" style="s2">start for our universe of a process of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.490" end="00:34:10.250" style="s2">the realization of potentiality and as</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.670" end="00:34:12.679" style="s2">the past accumulates as there&#39;s more and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.250" end="00:34:15.560" style="s2">more of it there is a richness of</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.679" end="00:34:18.080" style="s2">complexity which tends towards what we</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.560" end="00:34:20.840" style="s2">call evolution and trends towards the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.080" end="00:34:25.310" style="s2">emergence of novelty so that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.840" end="00:34:29.179" style="s2">that to use a lovely line which is from</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.310" end="00:34:31.370" style="s2">Brian swim the evolutionary philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.179" end="00:34:32.690" style="s2">who I love to bits and who said</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.370" end="00:34:34.520" style="s2">something like you know what have we</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.690" end="00:34:37.970" style="s2">learned we&#39;ve learned that if you take</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.520" end="00:34:40.850" style="s2">hydrogen and you wait long enough it</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.970" end="00:34:43.730" style="s2">learns to sing opera which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.850" end="00:34:45.530" style="s2">just spectacular because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.730" end="00:34:47.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve looked it&#39;s like you lis take</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.530" end="00:34:49.940" style="s2">hydrogen and it will emerge eventually</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.090" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">as you and me and and what I see in that</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.940" end="00:34:56.170" style="s2">and my attempt to integrate science was</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.879" end="00:34:59.180" style="s2">with a spiritual tradition is to go look</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.170" end="00:34:59.580" style="s2">well in this idea of evolution or over</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.180" end="00:35:01.800" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.580" end="00:35:03.900" style="s2">with Darwin and Wallace and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.800" end="00:35:07.070" style="s2">idea that ever this huge variety of life</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.900" end="00:35:11.280" style="s2">came from one simple source for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.070" end="00:35:13.500" style="s2">stunning idea that is I mean just wow I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.280" end="00:35:15.630" style="s2">mean and everything seems to point</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.500" end="00:35:18.090" style="s2">towards that being right and then a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.630" end="00:35:19.830" style="s2">hundred years ago we got the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.090" end="00:35:23.220" style="s2">Noah&#39;s wasn&#39;t just biology that had</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.830" end="00:35:26.310" style="s2">evolved a whole of that the universe had</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.220" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">evolved I mean and that some that is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.310" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">mythos of such grandeur I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:33.990" style="s2">why I say we&#39;re on we&#39;re on track guys I</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:35.730" style="s2">mean these these leaves ancient myths</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.990" end="00:35:38.610" style="s2">just like yeah whatever I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.730" end="00:35:40.440" style="s2">big stuff now so we&#39;ve got that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.610" end="00:35:43.890" style="s2">got this ten billion years of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.440" end="00:35:45.330" style="s2">evolution of the physical cosmos then</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.890" end="00:35:47.460" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the three billion years of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.330" end="00:35:49.830" style="s2">the evolution of life and then right at</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.460" end="00:35:54.270" style="s2">the end of that you&#39;ve got the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.830" end="00:35:56.220" style="s2">of psyche which is Greek for soul it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.270" end="00:35:58.230" style="s2">what the the Gnostics book there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.220" end="00:35:59.850" style="s2">gnostic word and it means the soul and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.230" end="00:36:01.860" style="s2">what it&#39;s pointing to what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.850" end="00:36:03.450" style="s2">pointing to what the word refers to is</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.860" end="00:36:06.900" style="s2">this experience you and I are having now</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.450" end="00:36:08.220" style="s2">of a non-material reality and we&#39;re in E</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.900" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">right now our bodies are sitting here</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.220" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">Minds doing it say you know things</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:13.710" style="s2">you&#39;re listening and nodding that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.870" style="s2">our bodies are doing and all the actions</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.710" end="00:36:17.850" style="s2">in a non-material realm and all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.870" end="00:36:19.710" style="s2">meaning isn&#39;t it is in that non material</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.850" end="00:36:22.620" style="s2">realm in the physical realm there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.710" end="00:36:25.110" style="s2">monkey making funny noises but in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.620" end="00:36:28.110" style="s2">non material realm we are sharing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.110" end="00:36:29.820" style="s2">meaning that&#39;s the latest thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.110" end="00:36:32.100" style="s2">whole evolutionary process is gone from</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.820" end="00:36:35.100" style="s2">basic matter to something not made of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.100" end="00:36:37.020" style="s2">matter made of images what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.100" end="00:36:38.460" style="s2">reductionists do is they reduce</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.020" end="00:36:40.770" style="s2">everything to what&#39;s come before until</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.460" end="00:36:43.110" style="s2">really it&#39;s just atoms or even lower</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.770" end="00:36:45.300" style="s2">than that what the emergent ists do is</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.110" end="00:36:47.910" style="s2">they go no no no it&#39;s reality emerging</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.300" end="00:36:51.360" style="s2">on evermore at deeper levels more</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.910" end="00:36:55.110" style="s2">emergent levels so the soul the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.360" end="00:36:57.600" style="s2">is not some byproduct of anything it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.110" end="00:37:00.090" style="s2">it&#39;s a level of reality well that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.600" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">spirituality says you know if you I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.090" end="00:37:04.050" style="s2">just been to speaking of a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.670" style="s2">festival in Hungary you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.050" end="00:37:07.470" style="s2">what people are exploring there is salt</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.670" end="00:37:08.280" style="s2">and you can go off into it and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.470" end="00:37:10.050" style="s2">it&#39;s huge</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.280" end="00:37:11.880" style="s2">there&#39;s worlds out there it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.050" end="00:37:12.580" style="s2">shamanic exploration all the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.880" end="00:37:15.580" style="s2">spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.580" end="00:37:18.250" style="s2">about that world that droite for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.580" end="00:37:20.530" style="s2">ancient Egyptians the imaginal realm of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.250" end="00:37:23.170" style="s2">the Sufis the Bihar dozy there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:37:23.170" end="00:37:30.370" style="s2">a it&#39;s a dimension so my thesis is look</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.720" end="00:37:32.020" style="s2">what spirituality does is it sees that</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.370" end="00:37:34.180" style="s2">it&#39;s pre-existent that&#39;s always been</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.180" end="00:37:46.630" style="s2">spiritual enough you can get out and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.280" style="s2">never have to come back because who</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.630" end="00:37:50.260" style="s2">would want to come back to hear what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.280" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">emergentist thing says is no no no</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.260" end="00:37:54.670" style="s2">actually life is a beautiful thing and</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:37:57.840" style="s2">it&#39;s emerging on ever deeper and more</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.670" end="00:38:01.630" style="s2">emergent levels and it&#39;s emerged as</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.840" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">finally this world of psyche a world of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.630" end="00:38:05.260" style="s2">the soul a world in which in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:07.810" style="s2">we can actually survive without the body</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.260" end="00:38:10.060" style="s2">and which we can explore in great depth</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.810" end="00:38:11.260" style="s2">through spiritual practices but not as</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.060" end="00:38:13.630" style="s2">something which has always been there</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.260" end="00:38:16.150" style="s2">which unfortunately through some cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.630" end="00:38:17.890" style="s2">mess-up we fell out of but actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.150" end="00:38:20.050" style="s2">something which is emerging in an</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.890" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">evolutionary current so there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.050" end="00:38:23.620" style="s2">phases of evolution it&#39;s a physical the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:25.480" style="s2">biological and then this soul phase and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.620" end="00:38:27.910" style="s2">then at the end of that I think in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.480" end="00:38:31.030" style="s2">new phase is where you started David is</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.910" end="00:38:38.350" style="s2">the very source that we&#39;re waking up to</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.550" end="00:38:40.630" style="s2">a fundamental oneness with where all</p>
