<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:26.369" style="s2">some great interviews lined up instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:28.130" style="s2">one of the producers asked me to simply</p>

<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">or less what we thought might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.219" end="00:00:42.480" style="s2">interesting is to have you in on the</p>

<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">perhaps you caught our first one which I</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.550" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">the world around us seems to have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:37.260" style="s2">completely miss explained and not only</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">miss explained for a short period of</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.260" end="00:01:41.700" style="s2">time but perhaps miss explained for</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">decades without anyone much noticing at</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.700" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">least that was our contention the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">contention is that because of a dizzying</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">amount of change in a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">sectors we have misinterpreted what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:56.090" style="s2">going on much more generally as change</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">across a great number of sectors</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.090" end="00:02:02.100" style="s2">likewise while we have generally enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:05.670" style="s2">a period of relative peace and</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.100" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">prosperity we have been somewhat innard</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.670" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">to the growing danger that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:13.019" style="s2">the sheer amount of violent potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">that is so far been kept under wraps in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.019" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">the stasis that followed World War two</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:21.330" style="s2">so these two features of our world that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:22.890" style="s2">is a generally peaceful world in which</p>

<p begin="00:02:34.670" end="00:02:39.900" style="s2">seems to be a relatively uncommon</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.690" end="00:02:47.220" style="s2">going to be about is breaking this</p>

<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">in some sense has been around since the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">early 1970s and almost all of us have</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:59.670" style="s2">grown up having our lives defined and</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">determined by the set of common</p>

<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">we live so what is the portal the portal</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.799" end="00:03:10.739" style="s2">is an attempt to end this bubble to look</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:12.360" style="s2">beyond the intellectual laziness and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.739" end="00:03:15.239" style="s2">stasis that is available everywhere</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.239" end="00:03:20.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say legacy sense making structures</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.940" end="00:03:21.330" style="s2">and to start listening in on a different</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.770" end="00:03:45.960" style="s2">well in part many of them are worried</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">about the idea of complacency and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.960" end="00:03:50.480" style="s2">excited about the idea of breaking</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">present almost no one has gotten beyond</p>

<p begin="00:04:08.910" end="00:04:14.040" style="s2">that could go into 200 or 300 years if</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.430" end="00:04:35.880" style="s2">come up with a much more detailed and</p>

<p begin="00:04:55.530" end="00:05:01.620" style="s2">would allow us to harness you know much</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.350" end="00:05:32.370" style="s2">to talk to you very simply and plainly</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.370" end="00:05:37.290" style="s2">face that almost no one is willing to</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.420" end="00:05:46.900" style="s2">that kind of broad growth is no longer</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.670" end="00:05:58.810" style="s2">different picture of where we are as a</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.370" end="00:06:24.970" style="s2">that&#39;s in large measure where we are</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.590" end="00:06:44.260" style="s2">excited about the release of every new</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.300" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">iPhone now has us relatively unexcited</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.260" end="00:06:49.000" style="s2">about the new suite of apps and features</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:50.670" style="s2">that every new phone promises will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.000" end="00:06:53.170" style="s2">slightly different than the one before</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.670" end="00:06:55.750" style="s2">so I think what&#39;s important to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.170" end="00:06:58.210" style="s2">about is how optimistic we once were</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.750" end="00:07:00.070" style="s2">what did we think we were going to do I</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.210" end="00:07:02.230" style="s2">think we thought we were going to be</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.150" end="00:07:09.310" style="s2">cancer when we declared a war on cancer</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.980" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">in the early 1970s what did we think we</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.310" end="00:07:12.370" style="s2">were going to be doing with energy</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:13.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t we think that fusion was around</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.370" end="00:07:15.970" style="s2">the corner</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.560" end="00:07:18.970" style="s2">if you think about all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.970" end="00:07:21.460" style="s2">that we could be doing we&#39;ve learned in</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.970" end="00:07:25.000" style="s2">most of these areas that it is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.460" end="00:07:27.010" style="s2">mature to hope to imagine that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.000" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">we are going to be able to make the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.010" end="00:07:30.550" style="s2">future very different than the present</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:32.200" style="s2">yes things will get a little bit better</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.550" end="00:07:34.780" style="s2">but are they going to get dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.200" end="00:07:37.450" style="s2">better are we going to be leading a life</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.780" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2">in our here and our now that would allow</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.450" end="00:07:42.970" style="s2">a kind of escapist lifestyle that we saw</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:45.700" style="s2">on Star Trek or even in Star Wars which</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.970" end="00:07:48.400" style="s2">came out in the 60s and 70s respectively</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.700" end="00:07:51.130" style="s2">I think that in general most of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.400" end="00:07:53.110" style="s2">realized that these dreams have remained</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.130" end="00:07:55.600" style="s2">dreams for so long that we&#39;ve consigned</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.110" end="00:07:57.370" style="s2">them to the world of children perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.600" end="00:08:00.160" style="s2">very dim people believe these things</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.370" end="00:08:02.139" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in is trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.160" end="00:08:04.210" style="s2">the smartest most dynamic and most</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.139" end="00:08:07.150" style="s2">agenting people in our society once</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:09.479" style="s2">again talking to each other and ignoring</p>

<p begin="00:08:12.039" end="00:08:15.970" style="s2">perhaps you think look this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.680" end="00:08:18.759" style="s2">sound very scientific</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.970" end="00:08:21.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we be relying on the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.759" end="00:08:23.770" style="s2">systems we have for example isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:26.889" style="s2">peer-reviewed science the gold standard</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.770" end="00:08:29.350" style="s2">well I would say no peer review is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.889" end="00:08:31.000" style="s2">relatively recent invention and I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.350" end="00:08:34.270" style="s2">even say an intrusion into the hard</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.000" end="00:08:37.180" style="s2">sciences in 1953 when the double helix</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.270" end="00:08:38.919" style="s2">was elucidated by Watson and Crick they</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.180" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2">submitted it to the journal Nature</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.919" end="00:08:43.719" style="s2">but it was never peer-reviewed why</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:45.790" style="s2">because an editors job was to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.719" end="00:08:47.470" style="s2">whether it was worthy of publication and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.790" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">in fact the editor at the time if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.470" end="00:08:51.880" style="s2">recall correctly said that anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:53.080" style="s2">saw this paper would be so influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.880" end="00:08:55.500" style="s2">it that he couldn&#39;t take the risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.080" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">sending it out for any kind of review</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.500" end="00:09:00.700" style="s2">well if that&#39;s true let&#39;s say peer</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:03.279" style="s2">review isn&#39;t really the centerpiece of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.700" end="00:09:06.310" style="s2">our science is the scientific method the</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:08.950" style="s2">centerpiece of our science well at some</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.310" end="00:09:10.600" style="s2">level sure it&#39;s like proof checking but</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.950" end="00:09:13.240" style="s2">a lot of the work that we do in science</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.600" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">has been incredibly imaginative and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:16.990" style="s2">might even say it&#39;s been irresponsible</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:19.750" style="s2">until it comes into final form and can</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.990" end="00:09:21.370" style="s2">be reconciled with experiment but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.750" end="00:09:23.980" style="s2">instead we&#39;ve developed a culture in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.370" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">which immediately upon proposing</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.980" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">something we are told that the cynic</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:33.459" style="s2">wanan of science is that there be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">agreement between theory and experiment</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.459" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">well this is wholly untrue in fact if</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2">you go back to Paul Derek&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:43.480" style="s2">great Scientific American article in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:45.430" style="s2">early 60s he says that it is much more</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.480" end="00:09:48.190" style="s2">important that a physical theory have</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.430" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">mathematical beauty and that we learned</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.190" end="00:09:52.330" style="s2">to trust a theory even when it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:55.450" style="s2">agree with experiment if it has a kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.330" end="00:09:57.430" style="s2">of intellectual coherence to it but how</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.450" end="00:10:01.150" style="s2">often are people pointed to something</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.430" end="00:10:02.080" style="s2">like directs 1963 paper in fact you</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.150" end="00:10:04.540" style="s2">could look to Jim</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.080" end="00:10:06.910" style="s2">Watson who&#39;s told us that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.540" end="00:10:11.170" style="s2">make great advances we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.910" end="00:10:13.270" style="s2">irresponsible now this is a very odd</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.170" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">feature of the world many of our top</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.270" end="00:10:17.290" style="s2">people do not seem to play by the rules</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:19.930" style="s2">that have been set for everyone else and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.290" end="00:10:21.250" style="s2">the question is if we are in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.930" end="00:10:23.980" style="s2">in which we have unleashed such</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.250" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">incredible destructive power as we did</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.980" end="00:10:29.050" style="s2">with the hydrogen bomb and in</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:31.450" style="s2">potentially unlocking the cell why is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.050" end="00:10:34.210" style="s2">that we are so incredibly timid about</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.450" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">what it is that we might do next we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.210" end="00:10:38.710" style="s2">all the destructive power that we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:40.750" style="s2">already at our fingertips what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.710" end="00:10:43.630" style="s2">have is the ability to escape our fate</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.750" end="00:10:46.540" style="s2">in fact what we need is to find the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.630" end="00:10:48.810" style="s2">portal to find a way out to find new</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.540" end="00:10:51.660" style="s2">economic vistas that will allow far</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.810" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">larger numbers of people to participate</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.660" end="00:10:56.140" style="s2">without causing an ecological disaster</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">if you take all the people let&#39;s say in</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.140" end="00:11:01.450" style="s2">India China and Bangladesh what have you</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:03.940" style="s2">who are leading lives at a far lower</p>

<p begin="00:11:20.380" end="00:11:24.370" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have the ability to</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.030" end="00:11:41.980" style="s2">share them in public I think what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.520" end="00:11:44.260" style="s2">need to do is to start dreaming much</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.980" end="00:11:47.560" style="s2">more aggressively dream much bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.260" end="00:11:50.050" style="s2">start dreaming in public with each other</p>

<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:56.620" style="s2">start unlocking the potential of human</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.850" end="00:14:14.530" style="s2">the portal is going to attempt to answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.130" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">these questions so it might well be</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.530" end="00:14:17.950" style="s2">asked how are we going to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.110" style="s2">something different on the portal that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.950" end="00:14:23.320" style="s2">might actually have a significant impact</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.110" end="00:14:26.710" style="s2">on our society and I&#39;m going to begin in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.320" end="00:14:27.390" style="s2">a kind of unexpected place how are we</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.710" end="00:14:31.590" style="s2">going to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.390" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">portal to be self-supporting well oddly</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.590" end="00:14:37.590" style="s2">when we proposed this podcast a friend</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:40.770" style="s2">of the program decided that he was in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.590" end="00:14:43.380" style="s2">position through business success to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.770" end="00:14:46.350" style="s2">fund the portal and to in fact remove</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.380" end="00:14:48.750" style="s2">the need for advertising from our desire</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.350" end="00:14:49.920" style="s2">to broadcast and I thought about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:51.750" style="s2">long and hard of course it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.920" end="00:14:53.130" style="s2">appealing to imagine that somebody cares</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.750" end="00:14:54.690" style="s2">so much about what&#39;s happening on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.130" end="00:14:58.170" style="s2">program that they&#39;re willing to bankroll</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.690" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">it however I think we&#39;ve decided against</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.170" end="00:15:02.580" style="s2">it at least initially and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">share some of my reasoning the reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.580" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">is that very few programs could possibly</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:10.470" style="s2">afford to do that and as important as</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:13.710" style="s2">this program is it&#39;s really not about me</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.470" end="00:15:16.430" style="s2">it&#39;s about what can we do with sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.710" end="00:15:18.990" style="s2">making done individualistically and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.430" end="00:15:21.810" style="s2">outside of any kind of institutional</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.990" end="00:15:23.790" style="s2">control my belief is that if the more</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.810" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">people are able to podcasts the more</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.790" end="00:15:29.430" style="s2">people are able to use these new</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">channels for outreach the greater the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.430" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">likelihood that we can create an</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:36.030" style="s2">ecosystem of interesting disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:38.190" style="s2">ideas to change everything so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.030" end="00:15:40.260" style="s2">it&#39;s much more important that we figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.190" end="00:15:42.870" style="s2">out some way of fixing the business</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.260" end="00:15:45.090" style="s2">model where all of these podcasts are</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.870" end="00:15:47.430" style="s2">somehow delivering value that people are</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.090" end="00:15:49.980" style="s2">at least initially unwilling to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.430" end="00:15:51.540" style="s2">because we&#39;ve all been taught to expect</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.980" end="00:15:54.420" style="s2">that these things that we consume</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.540" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">electronically are free well we want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.420" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">have the same problem at least initially</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2">as everyone else so that we can work on</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:02.820" style="s2">it can we teach advertisers and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:04.500" style="s2">capitalists to stay the course when</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.820" end="00:16:07.980" style="s2">somebody says something controversial</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.500" end="00:16:10.920" style="s2">but responsible to weather a storm of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.980" end="00:16:13.620" style="s2">boycott can we create what I&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.920" end="00:16:15.690" style="s2">risk vertices who actually pledge some</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.620" end="00:16:17.880" style="s2">loyalty to the people that you most want</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.690" end="00:16:19.890" style="s2">to see talking about the issues you most</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.880" end="00:16:22.920" style="s2">want to hear discussed if they can do so</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.890" end="00:16:24.720" style="s2">responsibly these risk for ties errs are</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.920" end="00:16:26.820" style="s2">people that we&#39;re going to go in search</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.720" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">of so if you have a product that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.820" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">think is terrific then you want to reach</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">people with tremendous brand loyalty I</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:36.630" style="s2">hope you&#39;ll consider being a risk Verta</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:38.700" style="s2">for the portal podcast and that means</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.630" end="00:16:41.130" style="s2">effectively getting to know us our</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.700" end="00:16:42.960" style="s2">audience and not immediately</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.130" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">chuckling at the first sign that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.960" end="00:16:46.610" style="s2">some sort of social media storm coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:48.660" style="s2">your way</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.610" end="00:16:50.310" style="s2">furthermore I think we&#39;re gonna talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.660" end="00:16:52.350" style="s2">about science and we&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.310" end="00:16:54.690" style="s2">dumbing it down I&#39;m very frustrated that</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.350" end="00:16:58.170" style="s2">very often when you see top quality</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.690" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">scientists going into let&#39;s say public</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.170" end="00:17:02.670" style="s2">outreach mode that they very often</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:03.930" style="s2">adulterate the subject matter in an</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.670" end="00:17:06.390" style="s2">attempt to make it more understandable</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.930" end="00:17:08.220" style="s2">now of course that&#39;s inevitable when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.390" end="00:17:09.630" style="s2">have people specializing in very</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.220" end="00:17:12.300" style="s2">difficult subjects that they&#39;ve studied</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.630" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">for years but I also feel that partially</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.300" end="00:17:15.630" style="s2">what happened is that we got into a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:18.150" style="s2">habit of under estimating the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.630" end="00:17:20.790" style="s2">intelligence of the audience rather than</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.150" end="00:17:23.400" style="s2">giving the audience the need to look up</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.790" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">some terminology to make some forays of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.400" end="00:17:27.150" style="s2">their own with a search engine we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:28.260" style="s2">gotten them into a complacent state</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.150" end="00:17:30.060" style="s2">where if they don&#39;t immediately</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.260" end="00:17:32.850" style="s2">understand something then somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.060" end="00:17:34.530" style="s2">fault is with the broadcaster well I</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.850" end="00:17:37.020" style="s2">think we reject this for a very simple</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.530" end="00:17:39.300" style="s2">reason do you remember when TV was</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.020" end="00:17:41.790" style="s2">called the idiot box I know that I&#39;m of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.300" end="00:17:43.890" style="s2">an age that that was a very common thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.790" end="00:17:45.240" style="s2">to do once upon a time but if you look</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.890" end="00:17:47.610" style="s2">at all of the amazing things that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.240" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">been happening on TV it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.610" end="00:17:51.690" style="s2">changed the format to watch something</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:54.330" style="s2">like Game of Thrones or The Sopranos or</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.690" end="00:17:56.700" style="s2">Mad Men now why is that because the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.330" end="00:17:58.860" style="s2">character lines and the storylines and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.700" end="00:18:01.710" style="s2">the development are so much more complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:04.350" style="s2">than anything people are able to do in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.710" end="00:18:07.050" style="s2">smaller format that in fact television</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.350" end="00:18:09.630" style="s2">quite surprisingly became the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.050" end="00:18:13.110" style="s2">distinguished media in which one can now</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.630" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">write well likewise I think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.110" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">do the same thing for the public</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:19.500" style="s2">discussion of science we need to draw</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:20.910" style="s2">more of you in and count on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.500" end="00:18:22.650" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been under estimating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.910" end="00:18:24.990" style="s2">intelligence of our followers for quite</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.650" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">some time and start playing up to your</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.990" end="00:18:29.820" style="s2">level and we may lose you along the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.030" end="00:18:31.680" style="s2">but I have faith that with our ability</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.820" end="00:18:33.570" style="s2">to monitor your comments and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.680" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">your feedback that we can find an</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:41.370" style="s2">which many of you will find that far</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.970" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">from being left behind by specialists</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.370" end="00:18:45.080" style="s2">you are actually able to participate in</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.840" end="00:18:52.350" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to pitch it at a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.190" end="00:18:54.440" style="s2">higher level we&#39;re gonna try to rescue a</p>

<p begin="00:18:54.440" end="00:18:58.940" style="s2">so that we can get more people with the</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.940" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2">camera as I&#39;m doing now but we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:08.000" style="s2">decided to explore some topics that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.090" end="00:19:11.000" style="s2">think could break some serious ground in</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.940" end="00:19:57.259" style="s2">now it sounds very strange to say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.159" end="00:19:59.690" style="s2">economic theory falls apart when human</p>
