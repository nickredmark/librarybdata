<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">even know how hard to grocery shopping</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.730" end="00:00:21.750" style="s2">these days so because I went grocery</p>

<p begin="00:00:29.039" end="00:00:33.719" style="s2">decided to get over myself a bit and try</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.830" end="00:00:36.500" style="s2">to just explain how we saved the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.719" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">together the thing that I say I can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.500" end="00:00:41.910" style="s2">that I know how but I can&#39;t explain it</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">and so I&#39;m just gonna do the best of my</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.910" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">ability explain how it is that these</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">save them all together I find its</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:53.730" style="s2">easiest to go through the like who what</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:57.210" style="s2">why when where why how to explain</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:00:58.590" style="s2">anything so where do we start what how</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.210" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">we saved the world the what what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.590" end="00:01:02.129" style="s2">actually create together this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">can&#39;t do it in just the five because</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.129" end="00:01:06.450" style="s2">there&#39;s like multiple layers of what</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:09.780" style="s2">we&#39;re creating but mainly a technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.450" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">cooperative solutions cooperative the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.780" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2">ability to be able to solve our problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">together without going through a central</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.860" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">body without needing our governments to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:27.799" style="s2">- ok things or regulate them or make</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">everybody comply with law and punishment</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.799" end="00:01:36.509" style="s2">because we the people actually have all</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">of the power in the world but we have we</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.509" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">feel like we have none of it right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:42.509" style="s2">one individual has very little power but</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">collectively we do the vast majority of</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:46.950" style="s2">people the 99%</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:49.560" style="s2">maybe not 99% in democracy because 90 99</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.950" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">% of people live in democracies but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.560" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">are the voters we are the workers and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">are the consumers I was just watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">the family on Netflix which is about</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:05.180" style="s2">once it&#39;s not actually about the cult</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">it&#39;s about Christianity and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.180" end="00:02:09.179" style="s2">basically the powers that be hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:10.739" style="s2">years ago sat around we&#39;re really angry</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.179" end="00:02:12.660" style="s2">at the labor movement decided to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.739" end="00:02:13.350" style="s2">cheeses to combat it with a god</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.660" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">breakfast</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.350" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">I watched it and I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">understand how how this is okay how this</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:24.810" style="s2">is happening but so why not use that</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:27.990" style="s2">same model that the one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.810" end="00:02:29.670" style="s2">they started was they were in a crisis</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.990" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">the crisis happens to have been the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.670" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">labor movement there is a lot of history</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.620" style="s2">of people squat of people being the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:40.920" style="s2">government&#39;s and people with money and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.620" end="00:02:43.590" style="s2">power squashing grassroots organizations</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.920" end="00:02:45.750" style="s2">the Black Panthers have happened to I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.590" end="00:02:48.690" style="s2">mean anytime you want to combat poverty</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.750" end="00:02:50.100" style="s2">anytime you want to give people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.690" end="00:02:52.740" style="s2">historically don&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.100" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">privilege and power any kind of a leg up</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.740" end="00:02:57.660" style="s2">collectively there&#39;s a lot of force</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:02:59.400" style="s2">working against that which is why we</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.660" end="00:03:01.860" style="s2">need a bigger force working for it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.400" end="00:03:03.840" style="s2">luckily we are the bigger force the only</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.860" end="00:03:05.910" style="s2">reason they&#39;re able to to divide and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.840" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">conquer us is by doing that dividing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.910" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">conquering by making it into its the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:12.030" style="s2">left versus the right and to the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">who want change which is the way the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.030" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">people who want things to stay the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:20.390" style="s2">and there is a real true conflict there</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">in that anytime we have a democracy</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.390" end="00:03:24.300" style="s2">whether at the city the state the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">federal level where I love those</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.300" end="00:03:32.010" style="s2">provinces but to still States and sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">that having we elect our leaders but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.010" end="00:03:40.740" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s based on democracy um</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:42.690" style="s2">the majority wins the minority is never</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.740" end="00:03:46.050" style="s2">really going to be happy I learned in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.690" end="00:03:47.880" style="s2">school democracies definition is rule of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.050" end="00:03:49.770" style="s2">the majority with respect to minority</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.880" end="00:03:52.620" style="s2">but that never really happens especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.770" end="00:03:54.150" style="s2">with the big minority right so in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.620" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">States there&#39;s a two-party system in</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.150" end="00:03:57.960" style="s2">Canada there&#39;s basically a two-party</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:03:59.310" style="s2">system but there&#39;s so many parties that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.960" end="00:04:03.750" style="s2">it&#39;s even I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.310" end="00:04:05.100" style="s2">broken but it&#39;s broken but it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.750" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">Conservatives and the Liberals or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.100" end="00:04:08.880" style="s2">basically the two the two here which</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">kind of conservatives kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.880" end="00:04:16.020" style="s2">Republicans and Democrats are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:18.480" style="s2">like the Liberals and one just under</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.020" end="00:04:19.950" style="s2">just over 450 percent right votes for</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.480" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">one just under in just over fifty</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.950" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">percent votes for the other one which</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">means you&#39;re ruling over nearly 50</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:29.640" style="s2">percent of your population</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">it can&#39;t stand you write that like but</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.640" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">wanted you not to be there and so if</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:36.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how we have to solve things right</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:38.040" style="s2">and then you have these governments</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.780" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">working with other governments in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.040" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">world to try to come up with solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:43.680" style="s2">that they have to bring back and sell it</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:44.970" style="s2">to their people right it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.680" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">happening now on a grand scale they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.970" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">kind of it up they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:49.950" style="s2">doing the best they can with the köppen</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">19 thing we see that you know like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.950" end="00:04:53.010" style="s2">everyone has their which works well</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:56.460" style="s2">because everyone has their own idea so</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:58.200" style="s2">we can look back at this and see what</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:04:59.580" style="s2">worked and what didn&#39;t but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.200" end="00:05:02.510" style="s2">necessarily going to know well we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.580" end="00:05:06.090" style="s2">it what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.510" end="00:05:07.410" style="s2">Kovach 19 i can&#39;t necessarily solve this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.090" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">has to be something down on the grand</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.410" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">scale right we can have some people stay</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">inside and some people going out not in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:16.800" style="s2">a city we could have some city stay at</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:18.180" style="s2">home and some cities going out but</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.800" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not how we&#39;re this first right</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.180" end="00:05:21.570" style="s2">just like we&#39;re not dispersed it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:23.220" style="s2">Republican and Democrat cities we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.570" end="00:05:27.300" style="s2">dispersed in a Republican and Democrat</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.220" end="00:05:28.590" style="s2">states even if there are states and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.300" end="00:05:29.700" style="s2">cities that are known for that right</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.590" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">there are cities that are always gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.700" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">vote Republican or Democrat or</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:35.730" style="s2">conservative or liberal but because</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.950" end="00:14:38.100" style="s2">cost do we have like creating with the</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.100" end="00:14:43.150" style="s2">and we have we have the we have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.080" end="00:14:45.220" style="s2">ability now right we have the technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.150" end="00:14:47.350" style="s2">these things could have maybe been</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.220" end="00:14:50.950" style="s2">possible in the 60s 70s and 80s</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.350" end="00:14:54.400" style="s2">but on a small small scale right you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.950" end="00:14:55.900" style="s2">have a commune you can have a kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.400" end="00:14:58.029" style="s2">you can have something where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.900" end="00:15:00.850" style="s2">collectively working together but it can</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.029" end="00:15:02.380" style="s2">only be so big because trust can only be</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.850" end="00:15:03.820" style="s2">so big right when I don&#39;t know these</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.380" end="00:15:06.550" style="s2">relationships and I don&#39;t know I can</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.550" end="00:15:10.420" style="s2">trust into it in fact most of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.890" end="00:15:12.490" style="s2">we can do together with the technology</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.420" end="00:15:13.930" style="s2">company the reason I&#39;m focused on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.490" end="00:15:15.610" style="s2">technology company then people&#39;s eyes</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.930" end="00:15:17.170" style="s2">glaze over it so like technology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.610" end="00:15:18.400" style="s2">the problem not the answer whatever just</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.170" end="00:15:19.540" style="s2">like Google and Facebook run our lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.400" end="00:15:22.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll don&#39;t let them run our lives</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.540" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">break them up do it&#39;s like why we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.690" end="00:15:26.620" style="s2">just recreate them and we could own them</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">and they could be for the common good</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.620" end="00:15:33.790" style="s2">instead of for profit we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:36.220" style="s2">world where we we can use our data for</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.790" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">so many much better things than</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.220" end="00:15:40.540" style="s2">selling us more we can use our data</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.790" style="s2">to cure cancer we could use our data to</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.540" end="00:15:45.130" style="s2">not shut down the economy drink Obed 19</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.790" end="00:15:46.030" style="s2">and tracker we could which is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.130" end="00:15:47.380" style="s2">they&#39;re saying right and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.030" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">government&#39;s gonna pass it it&#39;s gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:55.540" style="s2">gonna be a front to our freedom when</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.150" end="00:15:57.910" style="s2">they pass contact tracking if we pass</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.540" end="00:16:00.730" style="s2">contact tracking if it was an opt-in to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.910" end="00:16:02.710" style="s2">a bowl system that is literally what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.730" end="00:16:04.660" style="s2">came up with during our solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.710" end="00:16:07.240" style="s2">for infectious disease is oh if I could</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.660" end="00:16:09.730" style="s2">track I my contacts track where I was if</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.810" end="00:16:30.490" style="s2">way that we felt safe and efficient then</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:32.170" style="s2">we could say hey we need 90 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.490" end="00:16:34.030" style="s2">people to have their contacts tracked if</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:36.010" style="s2">anything needs a hundred percent of</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.860" end="00:18:12.309" style="s2">that then we could have contact tracing</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.910" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">and we could be out in the world but</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.309" end="00:18:15.940" style="s2">when our governments do it and they</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:18.250" style="s2">probably will because our cover our</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.360" end="00:18:28.510" style="s2">a vaccine because of how viruses work</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.659" end="00:18:31.330" style="s2">how coronaviruses work it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.510" end="00:18:32.740" style="s2">gonna be like the common cold that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.330" end="00:18:36.700" style="s2">can&#39;t have a vaccine for because it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.740" end="00:18:38.409" style="s2">mutates too fast how big of a scale is</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.700" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">necessary community state countries</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.409" end="00:18:42.700" style="s2">organize your Redemption well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:44.140" style="s2">starting none of this has to be done on</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.260" end="00:18:57.070" style="s2">are some projects we&#39;re doing solution</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.690" end="00:18:59.169" style="s2">raising and solution raisings are about</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.070" end="00:19:01.240" style="s2">finding of coming up with a solution</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.169" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">that we could actually implement if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.240" end="00:19:08.409" style="s2">had 10,000 people and $100,000 and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:10.690" style="s2">for some of those projects those 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.409" end="00:19:12.309" style="s2">people could be in the same city and</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.690" end="00:19:14.140" style="s2">that would be really powerful right to</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.309" end="00:19:15.789" style="s2">start our own food cooperative to start</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.140" end="00:19:17.559" style="s2">our own how do we feed ourselves for</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.789" end="00:19:19.510" style="s2">less money and have it actually be</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.559" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">enticing to the average everyday person</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.510" end="00:19:24.970" style="s2">so you can eat delicious nutritious food</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:28.409" style="s2">for less and less actual resources right</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.970" end="00:19:30.970" style="s2">your time your money put into it that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.409" end="00:19:32.919" style="s2">would be hard to do with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.970" end="00:19:36.460" style="s2">globally but 10,000 people in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.919" end="00:19:38.230" style="s2">if we created a food delivery system</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.460" end="00:19:40.090" style="s2">especially right now but would this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.230" end="00:19:41.530" style="s2">would be the harder times created in but</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.090" end="00:19:42.610" style="s2">if we created a food delivery system</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.530" end="00:19:44.830" style="s2">where people didn&#39;t have to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.610" end="00:19:46.570" style="s2">grocery store pick out what they want it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.830" end="00:19:49.990" style="s2">was like a meal plan meets a recipes</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.570" end="00:19:53.559" style="s2">meets food delivery and we share in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.990" end="00:19:55.000" style="s2">in the in the time and labor if it works</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.559" end="00:19:56.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re working it out</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:20:00.600" style="s2">with 10,000 people and like inviting</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.650" end="00:20:02.070" style="s2">more people after then</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.600" end="00:20:04.320" style="s2">bankruptcy every grocery store in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.070" end="00:20:06.300" style="s2">Vancouver nearly overnight because who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.320" end="00:20:09.890" style="s2">gonna choose to go to the grocery store</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.300" end="00:20:13.170" style="s2">and pick up their own groceries for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.890" end="00:20:16.200" style="s2">surplus price rather than be part of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.170" end="00:20:20.070" style="s2">system but they can either trade time or</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.200" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">money for and probably both and can get</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.070" end="00:20:23.040" style="s2">their food for cheaper and cheaper get</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2">really good nutritious food and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.040" end="00:20:26.790" style="s2">not working for them right if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:28.020" style="s2">just a really little reason why it</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.790" end="00:20:32.130" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t and so they&#39;re still shoes in</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.020" end="00:20:33.780" style="s2">the old system why and how can we get</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.130" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">that that one percent that five percent</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.780" end="00:20:38.610" style="s2">that ten percent on board right well</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.380" style="s2">with my dad own save on sorry</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.610" end="00:20:42.570" style="s2">they can&#39;t help with that but like oh</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.380" end="00:20:43.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t have this this product you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.570" end="00:20:45.720" style="s2">don&#39;t have this product well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.800" end="00:20:49.770" style="s2">get that right how do we actually get</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.720" end="00:20:52.740" style="s2">more and more people so it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.770" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">profiting side that&#39;s like how can I lie</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.740" end="00:20:55.830" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:56.900" style="s2">how can I trick you into giving me your</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.830" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">business me your money</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.900" end="00:21:03.570" style="s2">how can I be the most can pretend I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:04.890" style="s2">the most convenient cheap by marketing</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.570" end="00:21:06.630" style="s2">right by pretending on those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.890" end="00:21:08.130" style="s2">either being those things or pretending</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.630" end="00:21:10.800" style="s2">on those things you can&#39;t know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.130" end="00:21:12.450" style="s2">the cheapest price everywhere so you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.800" end="00:21:13.500" style="s2">put in in little gimmicks right like</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.450" end="00:21:15.180" style="s2">well if you tell us it&#39;s we&#39;ll give it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.500" end="00:21:21.810" style="s2">to you for free and we&#39;ll prep the price</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.180" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">well you know you&#39;re like um and then so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.810" end="00:21:30.180" style="s2">there&#39;s like or the old the historical</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:33.210" style="s2">communism or something equivalent where</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.180" end="00:21:34.620" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re gonna write a commune even</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.210" end="00:21:38.420" style="s2">right that works on a small scale and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.620" end="00:21:40.710" style="s2">works beautifully everyone&#39;s eating this</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.420" end="00:21:44.300" style="s2">we&#39;re buying it in bulk we&#39;re making it</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.710" end="00:21:47.100" style="s2">for you this is it&#39;s this or nothing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.300" end="00:21:49.730" style="s2">neither of those things is great so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.100" end="00:21:53.370" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly think of anything else</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.730" end="00:21:58.950" style="s2">well we can cooperate on a grand scale</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.370" end="00:22:01.830" style="s2">the bigger it is the more power there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.950" end="00:22:03.300" style="s2">but its internal power and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.830" end="00:22:05.400" style="s2">external power but mainly internal power</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.300" end="00:22:07.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s like the more of us there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.400" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">the better and more we can feed</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.440" end="00:22:12.150" style="s2">ourselves for cheaper and cheaper real</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.220" end="00:22:15.450" style="s2">cheap right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.150" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">not current cheap which is like how can</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.450" end="00:22:19.560" style="s2">we pass the cost off on to everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:22.350" style="s2">how can we actually ethically get our</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.560" end="00:22:24.300" style="s2">food costs down as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.350" end="00:22:26.010" style="s2">well it&#39;s growing it ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.300" end="00:22:27.750" style="s2">harvesting it ourselves cooking it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.010" end="00:22:29.580" style="s2">ourselves delivering it ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.750" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">actually mapping what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.580" end="00:22:34.050" style="s2">and what our current contribution looks</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:35.340" style="s2">like right what does your current life</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.050" end="00:22:38.220" style="s2">look like for food</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.340" end="00:22:40.250" style="s2">Co vid 19 to pre cope at 19 right how</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.220" end="00:22:42.660" style="s2">much time and money do you spend on food</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.250" end="00:22:44.520" style="s2">shopping and prepping cooking cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.660" end="00:22:47.730" style="s2">how much of that how can we come</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.520" end="00:22:49.850" style="s2">together and bring that down and so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.730" end="00:22:53.250" style="s2">more the bigger it is the better it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.850" end="00:22:55.050" style="s2">only if that&#39;s true right if we become</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.250" end="00:22:56.850" style="s2">big enough that we are like will bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.050" end="00:22:58.500" style="s2">art bro here off Kirsty everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.850" end="00:23:00.300" style="s2">eating celery soup on Monday because</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.500" end="00:23:01.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what we need then we lose</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.300" end="00:23:03.690" style="s2">everybody right because nobody wants</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.800" end="00:23:06.180" style="s2">celery soup every Monday unless you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.690" end="00:23:10.320" style="s2">really do we have a very tiny group of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.180" end="00:23:12.720" style="s2">people but if you are asking people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.320" end="00:23:14.910" style="s2">right how much diversity do we need in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.720" end="00:23:16.440" style="s2">options and if there isn&#39;t one for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.910" end="00:23:18.090" style="s2">especially if there&#39;s a specific diet</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.440" end="00:23:19.620" style="s2">that isn&#39;t for you right like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.090" end="00:23:19.860" style="s2">like no I&#39;m keto none of these work for</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.620" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.860" end="00:23:23.310" style="s2">how can we add that to our system</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.840" end="00:23:25.110" style="s2">instead of you needing to go off and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:28.860" style="s2">branch eating creating the competitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.110" end="00:23:31.440" style="s2">one because it&#39;s not vilifying or making</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.860" end="00:23:34.380" style="s2">a competition illegal right you always</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:36.090" style="s2">are free to go and start your own but</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.380" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">the more you start your own separate</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.090" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">from whatever already exists the more</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">you&#39;re costing both of us why when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:47.250" style="s2">not in competition and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.720" end="00:23:49.170" style="s2">designing it for profit your business</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.250" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2">only hurts our consumers right it hurts</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.170" end="00:23:54.300" style="s2">our user to have to pass to companies</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:56.460" style="s2">why do I always go with best to pass to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.300" end="00:23:58.920" style="s2">companies now rather than just one and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.460" end="00:24:00.630" style="s2">passing that efficiency off because if</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.920" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">we&#39;re not selling for profit there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.630" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">lying right there&#39;s no marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.780" style="s2">pretending or something or not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.320" end="00:24:09.060" style="s2">what is truth what are we putting in our</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.780" end="00:24:09.930" style="s2">pasta and why well this one&#39;s here to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.060" end="00:24:12.210" style="s2">give it a shelf-life</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.930" end="00:24:14.780" style="s2">okay do we want the shelf-life probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.210" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">it&#39;s faster okay let&#39;s move on it fresh</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.780" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">so having the information available so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:25.620" style="s2">that everyone can write we can make the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:28.140" style="s2">decision do we want salts in it</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.620" end="00:24:29.460" style="s2">do we want it to how much of a shelf</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.140" end="00:24:31.050" style="s2">life do we want it to have how many</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.460" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">varieties do we want it to have there</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.050" end="00:24:35.670" style="s2">might be one variety that is the vast</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:37.559" style="s2">majority of us want that one is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.670" end="00:24:39.420" style="s2">the cheapest because it&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.559" end="00:24:40.950" style="s2">one we can create on scale and then we</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.420" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">have to hopefully I hope we make</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.950" end="00:24:44.670" style="s2">accommodations for people who it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:46.920" style="s2">choice it&#39;s a real need that they have</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.920" end="00:24:52.980" style="s2">there&#39;s enough gluten intolerant people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.780" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">that&#39;s really not a problem but the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.980" end="00:24:56.820" style="s2">thing right that you&#39;re one in a million</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:24:58.470" style="s2">on and you&#39;re like no I can&#39;t eat this I</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.510" end="00:26:24.300" style="s2">think would be great for you to do it</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:27.270" style="s2">right if I think it the world should go</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.300" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">vegan which a little bit do even though</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.270" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">I&#39;m not a vegan it&#39;s like yeah I can see</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">how environmentally that would be good I</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:35.640" style="s2">also see how eating meat is good for my</p>

<p begin="00:26:35.640" end="00:26:43.240" style="s2">likes it like all all of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.400" end="00:26:48.100" style="s2">I can&#39;t invoke my will on people like</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.240" end="00:26:49.270" style="s2">the government can and yet we have the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.100" end="00:26:51.390" style="s2">power to come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.270" end="00:26:53.740" style="s2">solutions in a way the government can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.390" end="00:26:55.090" style="s2">because they have to do it for a hundred</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.809" end="00:27:05.800" style="s2">instead of creating it for a profit for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.030" end="00:27:07.480" style="s2">I created this solution and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.800" end="00:27:09.100" style="s2">sell it to you and market it to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.480" end="00:27:11.320" style="s2">which costs me something because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.100" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">a real risk to that and it cost you</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:20.290" style="s2">and so creating it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.700" end="00:27:24.910" style="s2">minimizes the risk because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.290" end="00:27:26.679" style="s2">spreading it and truly minimizes it if</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.910" end="00:27:28.090" style="s2">there&#39;s 10,000 people involved in</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.090" end="00:27:35.230" style="s2">solution it&#39;s already nearly risk-free</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.929" end="00:27:36.790" style="s2">because one those 10,000 people put in</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.230" end="00:27:40.090" style="s2">ten dollars a month or ten dollars total</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.790" end="00:27:43.420" style="s2">into a pool if that ten dollars is</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.090" end="00:27:45.550" style="s2">astronaut is a risk for you don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.420" end="00:27:46.690" style="s2">if it&#39;s not a risk if it&#39;s like playing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.550" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">the lottery you know you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.690" end="00:27:51.280" style="s2">win but it&#39;s fun to play and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:52.540" style="s2">putting it in and this is way better</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.280" end="00:27:53.980" style="s2">than winning the lottery because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.540" end="00:27:56.800" style="s2">literally everyone&#39;s playing whoever</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.800" end="00:28:02.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s like we&#39;re creating a system</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.040" end="00:28:04.600" style="s2">that is how can we feed 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.800" end="00:28:07.030" style="s2">how can we improve 10,000 people&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.460" end="00:28:14.970" style="s2">thousand dollars but you can create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:18.280" style="s2">doctor tracking app you can create a</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.970" end="00:28:20.290" style="s2">know what pills I&#39;m taking when app you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.280" end="00:28:22.390" style="s2">can create like there&#39;s there&#39;s so many</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.240" end="00:28:28.450" style="s2">the government had to make that app it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.770" end="00:28:29.950" style="s2">would be astronomically expensive and it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.450" end="00:28:31.059" style="s2">would it&#39;d be way too complex because</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.950" end="00:28:33.460" style="s2">they would need to make it for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.059" end="00:28:36.190" style="s2">we can say hey what&#39;s the most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:38.620" style="s2">thing we can create the food medication</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.190" end="00:28:40.600" style="s2">tracking run the doctor tracking one</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.620" end="00:28:42.820" style="s2">which one would give you the most which</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.600" end="00:28:44.590" style="s2">one would you use the most find ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.820" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">thousand people and create that one and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:47.800" style="s2">who knows in those ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">doing the medication tracker you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.800" end="00:28:50.560" style="s2">find that they also want the doctor</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:51.670" style="s2">tracker and you might incorporate it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.560" end="00:28:52.509" style="s2">into that but it&#39;s starting with</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.670" end="00:28:54.909" style="s2">something that</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.440" end="00:29:24.009" style="s2">million dollars someday it&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.539" end="00:29:28.359" style="s2">it&#39;s the same reason you know you would</p>

<p begin="00:30:42.759" end="00:30:47.979" style="s2">need everybody in the 10,000 to act like</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.029" end="00:30:51.969" style="s2">them and work like them not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.979" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">if the 10,000 require are like vilify</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.969" end="00:30:57.159" style="s2">the 10 for doing all of the work and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:58.899" style="s2">also not going to work great but if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.159" end="00:31:01.450" style="s2">can create a process where the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.899" end="00:31:02.889" style="s2">who put it in ten dollars are ten</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.450" end="00:31:04.539" style="s2">thousand people and like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.889" end="00:31:05.820" style="s2">want to get out of that ten dollars do</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.539" end="00:31:08.789" style="s2">you want to just get a right to vote</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.820" end="00:31:11.940" style="s2">do you want a entertaining like a show</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.789" end="00:31:14.369" style="s2">to watch that&#39;s gonna tell you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.940" end="00:31:16.919" style="s2">happening you can follow along like what</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.369" end="00:31:19.799" style="s2">is the the key thing that most people</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:22.409" style="s2">want and then how do we find because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.799" end="00:31:24.720" style="s2">give that 10 people they exist the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.409" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">10,000 people exist like 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.720" end="00:31:30.779" style="s2">who want to solve something anything I</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:32.369" style="s2">guarantee you if if it was possible for</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.779" end="00:31:35.070" style="s2">me to send a message to everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.369" end="00:31:36.299" style="s2">Vancouver and I was like hey want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.070" end="00:31:40.229" style="s2">come together and figure out our food</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.299" end="00:31:41.279" style="s2">system and actually had a way for 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.229" end="00:31:42.989" style="s2">people to come together and figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.279" end="00:31:44.609" style="s2">food system I would not have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.989" end="00:31:45.779" style="s2">getting 10,000 people in Vancouver to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.609" end="00:31:48.149" style="s2">come together and talk about our food</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.779" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">the issue is we don&#39;t have a system yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.149" end="00:31:52.619" style="s2">so what are we doing with those 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:54.029" style="s2">people and that I don&#39;t have a marketing</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.619" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">system that does that right I have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.029" end="00:31:59.070" style="s2">pay a lot of money to get those 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:04.200" style="s2">people and that&#39;s where like once you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.070" end="00:32:06.119" style="s2">have 10,000 people who eat they also</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.200" end="00:32:08.759" style="s2">probably have health care and they also</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.119" end="00:32:10.649" style="s2">some of those people have kids and even</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.759" end="00:32:13.049" style="s2">if let&#39;s say one in 10 has kids that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.649" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">need child care those people have</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.049" end="00:32:16.009" style="s2">friends who have kids who have child</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:18.659" style="s2">care so no matter what you&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.009" end="00:32:20.970" style="s2">next you start with a rather nice group</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.659" end="00:32:22.109" style="s2">of people right and maybe because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.970" end="00:32:23.460" style="s2">nice group of people you start with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.109" end="00:32:25.259" style="s2">broad group of people so like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.460" end="00:32:27.720" style="s2">needs to eat so the food app is a good</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.259" end="00:32:29.519" style="s2">place to start but once you have that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.720" end="00:32:31.830" style="s2">niche once you have that 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.519" end="00:32:34.289" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to find a new 10,000 for</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.830" end="00:32:36.809" style="s2">the next project if the process itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.289" end="00:32:38.820" style="s2">was engaging if people felt they got</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.809" end="00:32:42.450" style="s2">more than theirs money&#39;s worth out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.820" end="00:32:45.029" style="s2">the $10.00 they&#39;re gonna want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.450" end="00:32:46.109" style="s2">involved in every coming project and in</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.029" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">fact they&#39;re probably gonna want to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.109" end="00:32:49.529" style="s2">more and more involved right if you were</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.149" style="s2">part of that 10 and you feel gross</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.529" end="00:32:52.499" style="s2">because you feel like you contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.149" end="00:32:54.629" style="s2">much and you feel like you didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.499" end="00:32:56.279" style="s2">paid for it are you which honestly those</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.629" end="00:32:57.509" style="s2">10 are getting paid but like you&#39;re part</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.009" end="00:33:05.190" style="s2">paid versus your doing volunteer work</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.419" end="00:33:07.139" style="s2">and you feel gross and you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.190" end="00:33:08.789" style="s2">one there&#39;s hopefully way for you to</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.710" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">planet with this method finding ten</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.170" end="00:33:54.250" style="s2">thousand people creating a solution and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.809" style="s2">inviting the world and where the</p>

<p begin="00:33:55.809" end="00:33:59.350" style="s2">the solution or creating an off branch</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.820" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">solution that works for that you should</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.350" end="00:34:03.790" style="s2">right if we create a bring ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:05.920" style="s2">people together let me create a food app</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.790" end="00:34:08.619" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna work for those ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.920" end="00:34:10.419" style="s2">thousand people because you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.619" end="00:34:12.790" style="s2">something that works for that right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.419" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s we need it to meet most people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.790" end="00:34:17.889" style="s2">food needs most of the time and so if</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:20.169" style="s2">there&#39;s let&#39;s say a hundred things that</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.889" end="00:34:22.690" style="s2">a food out could do and we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.169" end="00:34:25.060" style="s2">fifteen of the top ones into our app</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not theirs there&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.060" end="00:34:28.330" style="s2">certain percentage they can&#39;t use it at</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:29.770" style="s2">all because of that but they really</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.330" end="00:34:31.330" style="s2">needed those key features and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.770" end="00:34:32.710" style="s2">gonna be people who are like well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.330" end="00:34:34.750" style="s2">use my other one until this one&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.710" end="00:34:38.859" style="s2">but as you&#39;re continually making this</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.750" end="00:34:40.629" style="s2">one better you&#39;re also asking right so</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.859" end="00:34:42.490" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry that a thousand of you we</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.629" end="00:34:44.409" style="s2">didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t fix this or even with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.490" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">your ten dollars what could have fixed</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.409" end="00:34:47.500" style="s2">it for you right and so those people can</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.030" style="s2">then either go form their own ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.500" end="00:34:50.470" style="s2">thousand group people right but then</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.030" end="00:34:51.879" style="s2">it&#39;s like well actually my kid has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.470" end="00:34:53.109" style="s2">really strong allergy and none of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.879" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">things work because you didn&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.109" end="00:34:57.400" style="s2">allergies into account there&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:35:02.380" style="s2">allergies I think we take into account</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.400" end="00:35:04.030" style="s2">but then we o&#39;c awesome you know how</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.380" end="00:35:05.770" style="s2">many people are with allergies so many</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.030" end="00:35:08.080" style="s2">let&#39;s find ten thousand people with your</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.770" end="00:35:10.240" style="s2">common allergy or with a severe allergy</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.080" end="00:35:12.040" style="s2">and let&#39;s have those conversations to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.240" end="00:35:13.420" style="s2">figure out food systems for people with</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.040" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">with family members at the severe</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.420" end="00:35:18.070" style="s2">allergies or severe conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:19.900" style="s2">allergies right so because maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.070" end="00:35:21.940" style="s2">what we didn&#39;t do right we we did it for</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.900" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">peanuts and eggs and milk but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.940" end="00:35:28.060" style="s2">do it for peanuts thanks a milk and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:30.070" style="s2">creating solutions together that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.060" end="00:35:32.109" style="s2">actual solutions and this is the issue</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.070" end="00:35:34.059" style="s2">right now is people are like this is now</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.109" end="00:35:36.279" style="s2">I don&#39;t understand it right like how do</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.059" end="00:35:38.049" style="s2">we create a solution together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.279" end="00:35:39.970" style="s2">what we&#39;re figuring out there may not be</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.049" end="00:35:41.890" style="s2">create a solution together because when</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.970" end="00:35:44.470" style="s2">we create it together we have the power</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.890" end="00:35:47.289" style="s2">and the ingenuity to make it happen but</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.470" end="00:35:49.960" style="s2">when I create it I have to sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.289" end="00:35:51.400" style="s2">you whether or not for even if I create</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.970" end="00:36:46.299" style="s2">market right I came up with an idea when</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.470" end="00:36:47.499" style="s2">people be able to use it I came up with</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.299" end="00:36:50.200" style="s2">a new product and when people are going</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.499" end="00:36:53.980" style="s2">to use it then we can create a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.200" end="00:36:55.749" style="s2">that&#39;s much more favorable to the best</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.980" end="00:36:57.489" style="s2">solutions being in the marketplace right</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.749" end="00:36:58.989" style="s2">because is it a solution we want to be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.489" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">part of and can we help make that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.989" end="00:37:03.609" style="s2">solution better starting with literally</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:05.589" style="s2">anything and then just incrementally</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.609" end="00:37:08.220" style="s2">improving it starting with any number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.589" end="00:37:12.279" style="s2">people and then just growing it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.220" end="00:37:14.380" style="s2">growing it in a way that isn&#39;t lying</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.279" end="00:37:15.940" style="s2">right it&#39;s honest it&#39;s like we&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:37:15.940" end="00:37:20.200" style="s2">which is why what I&#39;m promising in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.739" end="00:37:22.359" style="s2">beginning which I&#39;m hoping we will</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.200" end="00:37:23.049" style="s2">deliver is literally a world that works</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.900" end="00:37:32.410" style="s2">solution is something that will work for</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.470" end="00:37:33.910" style="s2">most people most of the time and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.410" end="00:37:36.069" style="s2">I&#39;m hopefully promising is that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.910" end="00:37:38.410" style="s2">process is enjoyable for you because if</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.069" end="00:37:40.720" style="s2">the process isn&#39;t enjoyable for you it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:37:40.720" end="00:37:45.880" style="s2">yet to come on to once this thing is so</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.569" end="00:37:49.210" style="s2">easy it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:58.780" style="s2">human ability out there so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.170" end="00:38:01.000" style="s2">somewhere for anyone to compete to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.780" end="00:38:05.140" style="s2">contribute in a fun engaging way for</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.000" end="00:38:06.610" style="s2">themselves you can see it&#39;s fun right no</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.140" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">one has to convince you it&#39;s fun to be</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:14.530" style="s2">right if it&#39;s that easy to be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.210" end="00:38:16.840" style="s2">that you actually have to like rein</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.530" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">yourself in hey I should go see some</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.840" end="00:38:19.660" style="s2">friends and stop saving the world for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:22.120" style="s2">bit that&#39;s my life</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.660" end="00:38:23.830" style="s2">that&#39;s my life right now without having</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.120" end="00:38:26.080" style="s2">the thing that makes it easy and fun to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.830" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">do and don&#39;t go see friends cuz we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.080" end="00:38:31.450" style="s2">all second side and resiliency but in</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.950" style="s2">the normal world this is kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.450" end="00:38:36.790" style="s2">normal as I&#39;ve mentioned several times</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.950" end="00:38:38.680" style="s2">so finding just that by creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.790" end="00:38:40.540" style="s2">solutions that people want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.680" end="00:38:43.000" style="s2">and then inviting more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.540" end="00:38:44.980" style="s2">and when you can create something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.000" end="00:38:48.310" style="s2">scalable right if we create something</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.980" end="00:38:52.990" style="s2">that&#39;s in what&#39;s the word internal some</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.310" end="00:38:54.760" style="s2">word like this solutions just for these</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.990" end="00:38:56.500" style="s2">10,000 people right now we can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.760" end="00:39:00.820" style="s2">more people involved on board with this</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.500" end="00:39:02.950" style="s2">particular solution but we just created</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.820" end="00:39:06.270" style="s2">a solution for 10,000 people so even if</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.950" end="00:39:08.470" style="s2">you can&#39;t be part of this specific group</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.270" end="00:39:10.420" style="s2">we can give you that knowledge in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.470" end="00:39:12.460" style="s2">system so you can create a another</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.420" end="00:39:14.470" style="s2">10,000 people group but most solutions</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.460" end="00:39:16.870" style="s2">are actually gonna be wait if we if we</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.470" end="00:39:18.250" style="s2">can do this for 10,000 we can definitely</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.870" end="00:39:19.300" style="s2">do it for 20,000 we can do it for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.250" end="00:39:21.940" style="s2">hundred thousand we can do it for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.300" end="00:39:24.040" style="s2">million so it&#39;s scalable some of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.940" end="00:39:26.170" style="s2">like my my cousin community that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.040" end="00:39:27.340" style="s2">in session right they&#39;re like we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.170" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">eating together we&#39;re not cooking meals</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.340" end="00:39:32.380" style="s2">for each other right now but that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.610" style="s2">community and that there&#39;s only so many</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.380" end="00:39:34.900" style="s2">people can be part of that right not all</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.610" end="00:39:37.590" style="s2">the vancouver can come and eat dinner</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.900" end="00:39:40.840" style="s2">and cook dinner in this kitchen but</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.590" end="00:39:43.720" style="s2">there can be a like anyone could have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.840" end="00:39:46.510" style="s2">cohousing common meal plan right if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.720" end="00:39:49.090" style="s2">have a kitchen and a space to eat in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.510" end="00:39:50.410" style="s2">can do that for a hundred people okay so</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.090" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">how many hundred people&#39;s in the city</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.410" end="00:39:54.760" style="s2">right like we can it&#39;s still scalable</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2">even if this group isn&#39;t scalable right</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.760" end="00:39:58.780" style="s2">we can&#39;t have everyone in this group</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.520" end="00:39:59.559" style="s2">everyone can be part of this and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.780" end="00:40:01.029" style="s2">where we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.559" end="00:40:04.180" style="s2">for omni wind solutions we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.029" end="00:40:06.819" style="s2">for things and because I have this</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.180" end="00:40:08.709" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have this right</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.819" end="00:40:11.589" style="s2">me having connection and friendship and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.709" end="00:40:13.809" style="s2">love and food and doesn&#39;t cost you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.589" end="00:40:15.249" style="s2">let&#39;s define it-- resource and food is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.809" end="00:40:17.829" style="s2">finite resource only cuz we designed it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.249" end="00:40:19.569" style="s2">to be that way we can make enough food</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.829" end="00:40:21.009" style="s2">right if we have enough labour and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.569" end="00:40:23.019" style="s2">have enough lands and we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.009" end="00:40:26.380" style="s2">knowledge we can definitely make enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.019" end="00:40:28.599" style="s2">food and with 10,000 I can pick any</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.380" end="00:40:31.769" style="s2">10,000 random people and I guarantee you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.599" end="00:40:34.209" style="s2">we have enough knowledge we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.769" end="00:40:36.309" style="s2">passion and like wanting to do the labor</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.209" end="00:40:38.199" style="s2">and we probably have lands amongst those</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.309" end="00:40:39.609" style="s2">10,000 people who are willing like I</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.199" end="00:40:39.789" style="s2">have a backyard I&#39;m not oh I don&#39;t own</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.609" end="00:40:43.180" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.789" end="00:40:45.309" style="s2">I rent but by all means go for it go for</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.180" end="00:40:47.739" style="s2">it grow food I don&#39;t have the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.309" end="00:40:49.059" style="s2">I&#39;m trying I&#39;m trying the best I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.739" end="00:40:54.519" style="s2">this year to grow a garden but I know</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.059" end="00:40:56.019" style="s2">year after year it fails we and then of</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.519" end="00:40:57.849" style="s2">course like most of the food I eat isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.019" end="00:40:59.439" style="s2">grown from a garden it&#39;s packaged it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.849" end="00:41:01.349" style="s2">done that right so but where did it come</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.439" end="00:41:03.819" style="s2">from can we bulk buy it can we like any</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.349" end="00:41:04.449" style="s2">sector of system all the sectors are</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.819" end="00:41:07.630" style="s2">intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.449" end="00:41:09.130" style="s2">you can&#39;t fix or break the food system</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.630" end="00:41:12.609" style="s2">without that affecting everything else</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.130" end="00:41:18.039" style="s2">and that is part of why everyone feels</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.609" end="00:41:20.920" style="s2">so paralyzed by our current situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.039" end="00:41:23.289" style="s2">and our bigger city like the current co</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.920" end="00:41:26.589" style="s2">bid 19 thing and the bigger oh crap</p>

<p begin="00:41:32.289" end="00:41:36.459" style="s2">climate change is we&#39;re not doing nearly</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.869" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">enough and there&#39;s people who think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.459" end="00:41:40.289" style="s2">way over hyped and I should be able to</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.589" end="00:44:30.469" style="s2">have to explain and communicated to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.789" end="00:44:34.309" style="s2">other people which is great because it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.469" end="00:44:35.900" style="s2">means people a group of people need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.309" end="00:44:38.660" style="s2">come up with the solutions right like</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.900" end="00:44:39.949" style="s2">the solution raising is a solution so</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.660" end="00:44:41.839" style="s2">tomorrow during this time period</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.949" end="00:44:43.429" style="s2">I&#39;ve yet to make it yet to invite people</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.839" end="00:44:46.069" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see if it actually works is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.429" end="00:44:49.489" style="s2">like I could do a solution raising on my</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.069" end="00:44:54.559" style="s2">own but that&#39;s not fun um happy and</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.489" end="00:44:56.299" style="s2">thanks dr. X happy and in case you&#39;re on</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.299" end="00:45:05.569" style="s2">finding saying finding solutions yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.369" end="00:45:07.789" style="s2">finding a group of people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.569" end="00:45:09.920" style="s2">have the conversation hopefully live on</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.789" end="00:45:12.349" style="s2">camera because it just is better for</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.920" end="00:45:15.319" style="s2">every or trust or recruitment for</p>

<p begin="00:45:15.319" end="00:45:17.779" style="s2">group of people who are willing to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.429" end="00:45:19.459" style="s2">the conversation about how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.779" end="00:45:21.499" style="s2">a system for ten thousand people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.459" end="00:45:23.089" style="s2">willing to do it on June what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.499" end="00:45:25.339" style="s2">going to do it on video chat that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.089" end="00:45:27.199" style="s2">live on YouTube but the main thing is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.339" end="00:45:28.339" style="s2">finding people who are who want to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.199" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">that conversation who want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.339" end="00:45:32.599" style="s2">participate in the solution raisings but</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:34.309" style="s2">more even more than that a solution</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.599" end="00:45:37.249" style="s2">raising on solution how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.309" end="00:45:39.289" style="s2">get 10,000 people and what does the</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.249" end="00:45:41.509" style="s2">process look like to have them involved</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.289" end="00:45:44.569" style="s2">right if it&#39;s ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.509" end="00:45:45.829" style="s2">donating and it&#39;s just that level what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.569" end="00:45:47.749" style="s2">does that look like so that we would</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.829" end="00:45:49.130" style="s2">want to be that 10,000 people even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.749" end="00:45:49.939" style="s2">we&#39;re not right we&#39;re clearly the five</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.130" end="00:45:51.650" style="s2">coming together we&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.939" end="00:45:53.869" style="s2">completely the central body and not the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.650" end="00:45:56.269" style="s2">big 10,000 but if we were the ten</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.869" end="00:45:59.630" style="s2">thousand how to be creative right is it</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.269" end="00:46:01.249" style="s2">a show is it a is it bodean is it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.630" end="00:46:03.679" style="s2">part of that&#39;s having 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.249" end="00:46:06.049" style="s2">if they&#39;re not on video in like watching</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.679" end="00:46:08.209" style="s2">in the comments saying yes I would want</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.049" end="00:46:10.279" style="s2">that and not that or this and not that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.209" end="00:46:12.170" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s creating it with and for</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.279" end="00:46:14.329" style="s2">the people and so if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.170" end="00:46:16.459" style="s2">here that&#39;s not quite working now if the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.329" end="00:46:18.109" style="s2">solution is some some bad actors from</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.459" end="00:46:20.089" style="s2">Google being like no actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.109" end="00:46:21.859" style="s2">Google should get to own everything and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.089" end="00:46:24.619" style="s2">I don&#39;t like we&#39;re not gonna fall for it</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.859" end="00:46:25.789" style="s2">but if someone truly feels that way I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.619" end="00:46:28.309" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t even know how to back that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.789" end="00:46:30.019" style="s2">up I do I really don&#39;t I really think</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.309" end="00:46:32.630" style="s2">that Google should own all of our data I</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.019" end="00:46:33.949" style="s2">really think that more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.630" end="00:46:35.479" style="s2">should be billionaires and we should</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.949" end="00:46:37.449" style="s2">have more of a disparity between the</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.479" end="00:46:40.210" style="s2">rich and the poor</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.449" end="00:46:42.670" style="s2">cool awesome you go focus on</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.210" end="00:46:45.099" style="s2">that solution and we will focus on</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.670" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">actual solutions right actual solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.099" end="00:46:50.710" style="s2">that make life better and easier for</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:53.050" style="s2">people because that&#39;s what we want and</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.710" end="00:46:54.700" style="s2">there&#39;s also people like myself like</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.050" end="00:46:56.710" style="s2">many people who I come in contact with</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.700" end="00:46:58.630" style="s2">who wants a better world and are willing</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.710" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">to pay more for a better world are</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.630" end="00:47:02.710" style="s2">willing to do more work for a better</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:04.540" style="s2">world and then there&#39;s the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.710" end="00:47:08.470" style="s2">no I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.540" end="00:47:09.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:47:16.750" end="00:47:21.460" style="s2">like having dealing with it having dealt</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.460" end="00:47:26.530" style="s2">it is overwhelming if you can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.950" end="00:47:27.849" style="s2">that that&#39;s okay but please don&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.530" end="00:47:29.830" style="s2">in the way of the rest of us creating a</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.849" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">better world and part of creating that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.830" end="00:47:39.070" style="s2">is is owning that we&#39;re that is how we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:42.520" style="s2">need to create it for right if what we</p>
